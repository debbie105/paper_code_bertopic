Mr Skemp's preposterous provision: the drafting of the Patents Act 1977 and harmonization in the 1970s,Patents Act 1977; European Patent Convention; legislative drafting; implementing treaties; harmonization; ,"The Patents Act 1977 created a new law of patents based on the European Patent Convention (1973). However, the wording of the Act did not 'copy out' the text of the Convention, but was drafted in traditional statutory language to give it effect. Nevertheless, to facilitate harmonization, the Act included a unique provision in British law: section 130(7). Both the drafter's approach and this 'preposterous' provision have been lamented by the patent judiciary for nearly four decades. But is this criticism fair?",2015,Government & Law

The compliance of South Africa's patents compulsory licensing regime to the TRIPs Agreement,compensation; competition; compulsory licensing; patents; South Africa; ,"In South Africa, patents compulsory licences can be issued under the Patents Act or Competition Act although the latter is not explicit. Whereas there has not been a single compulsory licence issued through the Patents Act, there is however a growing interest to obtain compulsory licences of drugs using the competition law regime. Focusing specifically on the standard of compensation, the objectives of this paper are two-fold: first, it seeks to determine why there is a growing interest in resorting to the competition route as opposed to the Patents Act. Secondly, the paper aims to determine the extent to which the South African compulsory licensing regime complies with the TRIPs Agreement. It is found herein that the standard of compensation under patents law is higher than that found in the competition law cases. Further, it is found however that compulsory licences issued through the competition law do not take into account the procedural safeguards that are found in the Patents Act as well as the TRIPs Agreement; as such, they undoubtedly infringe the rights of the patentees. The article recommends that the South African Competition Act should be reviewed with a view to aligning its compulsory licensing scheme with that of the Patents Act and the TRIPs Agreement, thereby establishing a nexus between competition law and patents law. This paper comes at an opportune moment in which South Africa and China are urging other WTO members to share their national experiences on the use of competition law to ensure access to health, and it shall therefore shed some light on how South Africa does it and the obstacles therein.",2019,Government & Law

"Biotechnology patenting caught between Union law and EPC law: European bundle patents, unitary patents and intentional harmonization of decisions in the internal market",biotechnology; patentability requirements; European patent; unitary patent; Directive 98/44; Regulation 1257/2012; harmonization; ,"Although in the European Union (the Union) the substantive rules for the patenting of biotechnological inventions are governed by Directive 98/44, the actual examination and grant of patents in Europe is provided by the European Patent Office (EPO), which is not part of the Union legal order and acts according to a non-Union legal instrument, the European Patent Convention (EPC). This hybrid situation results in legal uncertainty and can lead to partly inconsistent applications of patentability requirements, since the EPO is not bound to Union law and cannot refer questions to the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU). Thus, there is no guarantee that the Union and Unified Patent Court (UPC) judiciaries, on the one hand, and the EPO judiciaries, on the other hand, will come to comparable conclusions regarding the patenting of identical biotechnological subject-matter in the Union, irrespective of whether it concerns a classic European patent or a unitary patent. However, the unitary patent is introduced in the framework of fostering the functioning of the internal market and ensuring undistorted competition, and it provides uniform protection. The CJEU has given a very limited interpretation only to this concept of uniformity, leaving room for inconsistent decisions. Hence, it would appear that only intentional, determined harmonization efforts of the diverse judiciaries involved can increase consistency between decisions of the Union and the non-Union legal systems, although the judiciaries are unrelated. This call for coherency becomes even more pressing with the establishment of the unitary patent. Given this complex situation it may be questioned whether in the Union the law-makers of Directive 98/44 can fully achieve their aim in regulating and harmonizing biotechnology patenting.",2016,Government & Law
"SALVAGING THE LAW OF PATENT VENUE: BRUNETTE, TC HEARTLAND, AND THE VENUE CLARIFICATION ACT",; ,"In TC Heartland v. Kraft Foods Group Brands, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle that no part of the general venue statute, 28 U.S.C. 1391, could supplement the patent venue statute, 28 U.S.C. 1400(b). Yet, in Brunette Machine Works v. Kockum Industries, the Court nevertheless held that former 1391(d), which allowed suits against aliens in any district, applied in patent cases because aliens simply lacked all venue defenses. But then, in 2011, Congress passed the Venue Clarification Act, amending 1391 to affirmatively give a venue defense to permanent resident aliens. This entangled trifecta of venue law sources leaves open several important questions about the current state of patent venue: Does Brunette contravene TC Heartland? Does the Venue Clarification Act overrule Brunette? Does TC Heartland forbid applying the Venue Clarification Act to patent suits? This Comment reconciles these sources of law and extricates them from their current mire. Ultimately, this Comment argues that Brunette and TC Heartland do not conflict, that Brunette must be tweaked to accommodate the Venue Clarification Act, and that select provisions of the Venue Clarification Act do, in fact, apply to the patent venue statute.",2019,Government & Law

Patenting Bioprinted Structures in a Clime of Moral Uncertainty: Time to Amend the Patents Act?,; TISSUE CONSTRUCTS; MYRIAD-GENETICS; 3D; ETHICS; POLICY; CELLS,"The role of morality in Australia's patent regime has remained largely uncertain owing in part to a general reluctance to engage with the general inconvenience proviso. The prevailing view is that matters of morality and indeed ethics are within the exclusive purview of the legislature. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts at law reform, the situation remains largely unchanged. Drawing from the words of the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 2004 Genes and Ingenuity Report, it appears there has been no compelling case for amending the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) to allow expressly for the exclusion of particular subject matter from patentability on social or ethical grounds. More than a decade on, the question is whether this statement holds true. Accordingly, this article evaluates the current ethical exclusions in Australia's patent regime in light of the dilemma posed by patenting bioprinted structures and considers whether this presents a compelling enough case for the amendment of the Patents Act 1990.",2019,Government & Law
PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENT LAW,; PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT; LITIGATION; STANDARDS; AGENCIES; LEGITIMACY; QUALITY; RIGHTS; STATE,"Law enforcement in the modern regulatory state is largely a joint enterprise. In areas such as securities, antitrust, civil rights, and environmental law, enforcement responsibilities are allocated between public and private actors. Patent law, on the other hand, is enforced almost exclusively through private lawsuits. Considering patent law's constitutionally mandated public purpose- to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts -this privatization of patent enforcement is troubling. In recent years, there has been some movement away from this purely private enforcement scheme for patent law. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, for example, have involved themselves in certain patent matters that implicate antitrust law. Although this is a step in the right direction, these regulators alone cannot adequately enforce patent law due to their limited jurisdiction, resources, and expertise. This Article thus proposes a robust public enforcement regime for patent law. It argues that Congress should arm the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), the agency responsible for reviewing patents ex ante, with broad powers to police patent validity ex post. The PTO is best situated to lead this effort because of the agency's expertise, institutional resources, and enhanced powers under the America Invents Act. Moreover, charging the PTO with the responsibility for policing patents should serve to dispel allegations of agency capture and institutional bias toward patent owners.",2016,Government & Law

We find a significant increase in patents and patent citations for firms head-quartered in states that have passed ENDAs relative to firms head-quartered in states that have not. This result is more pronounced for firms that previously have not implemented pro-gay nondiscrimination policies, for firms in states with a large homosexual population, and for firms in human capital-intensive industries. Lastly, we provide evidence suggesting that ENDAs affect innovation by matching employees, who are generally more creative than anti-gay employees, with innovative firms.",2017,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
THE AMERICA INVENTS ACT: A NEW PATENT SYSTEM FOR THE 21ST CENTURY,America Invents Act; first inventor to file; prior art; post-grant procedures; ,"From its first patent statute, the United States awarded patents to the first person to invent. The rest of the world eventually adopted first to file regimes, in which the first person to file a patent application was awarded the patent. In 2013, the United States moved closer to harmonizing with the rest of the world. The America Invents Act created a first inventor to file system, representing the most dramatic change in US patent law in over fifty years. This chapter explores the new provisions by offering a basic operation of how they operate. It then discusses the myriad of new administrative procedures at the United States Patent and Trademark Office that were created in the America Invents Act. These procedures have the potential to challenge patents more cheaply than in litigation. The chapter discusses the various requirements and limitations of these provisions.",2016,Business & Economics
Impact of America Invents Act on Biotech Intellectual Property,; ,"This reviewintroduces the America Invents Act (AIA), a comprehensive reform of U.S. lawon patentability and patent enforceability that Congress enacted in 2011. The AIA's most publicized change transforms the United States from a first-to-invent system to a first-inventor-to-file regime, bringing U.S. patent law more in line with the patent systems of nearly every other industrialized country in the world. This new system requires small companies and independent inventors to toe the line against larger competitors in what many have called a race to the patent office. But a closer look at the AIA reveals several opportunities for smaller entities that may even the playing field, particularly for innovators in the biotech sector. This article addresses changes that the AIA brings to U.S. patent law, keeping an eye toward issues relevant to biotech companies.",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine
STEM CELL AND BIOTECHNOLOGICAL PATENTABILITY AND RESEARCH IN THE EUROPEAN UNION: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH,; ,"Stem cell and biotechnological research is a flourishing industry around the globe. The growth of the industry can be attributed to its promise to lead to a cure for numerous human diseases that are currently considered unconquered. Within this industry, the patentability of researched innovations has been a hot topic in the past decade. Through the patenting process, the industry itself can be a source of economic opportunity for countries willing to extend patent protection for the inventions produced by stem cell and biotechnological research. Because it takes significant resources for research to produce a patentable invention, investors desire assurances that their time and money will head a result from which they can benefit, whether that be a financial benefit, a status benefit, or some other benefit. Despite the medical promises of stem cell and biotechnological research, there are concerns in some places around the world such as the European Union about potential policy implications that would stem from patenting innovations in this industry. These concerns are displayed in the two leading sources of law governing stem cell and biotechnological research: the European Union's Directive 98/44/EC and the European Patent Convention. This Article discusses the patentability of stem cell and biotechnological inventions under both European Union law and the European Patent Convention. The Article continues by discussing several other topics that a practitioner must be familiar with when analyzing a patentability issue. A few of these topics include the morality debate, the promise of stem cell and biotechnological research, taxation of stem cell-related products, access to records, legal notice, research funding, and the free movement of goods. This Article also examines the key case law from both the European Court of Justice as well as the two judicial organs of the European Patent Office, the Board of Appeal and the Enlarged Board of Appeal, that provide insight into this area of law. Additionally, this Article identifies the discrepancies between the law governing stem cell research and biotechnological research within the European continent and provides recommendations for greater harmonization within these two areas of law.",2018,Government & Law
Intellectual Property from a Global Environmental Law Perspective: Lessons from Patent Disclosure Requirements for Genetic Resources and Traditional Knowledge,Intellectual property; Patents; Traditional knowledge; Disclosure requirements; Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Nagoya Protocol; Genetic resources; ,"This commentary considers the intellectual property (IP) system from a global environmental law perspective by exploring the extent to which patent-related treaties, such as the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the World Intellectual Property Organization Patent Cooperation Treaty, can facilitate implementation of global environmental standards in the field of biodiversity law. It provides practical guidance to countries that wish to introduce patent disclosure-related mechanisms into their legal systems with a view to mainstreaming instances of global justice, fairness and equity, and raises awareness of the limitations arising from their extant IP obligations. Global environmental law standards have exercised an undeniable influence on the political discourse in international IP policy making in the field of patent disclosure. Still, many patent disclosure requirements that pre-date the Nagoya Protocol apply only to genetic resources the provenance of which is the same country that established the requirement. However, if a country designates its patent or IP office as a compliance checkpoint under the Nagoya Protocol, then the disclosure requirement should encompass at least the genetic resources originating from all countries that are contracting parties to this instrument. This could allow the fulfilment of a core monitoring obligation of the latter, while enabling wider synergies and transparency within the IP system.",2019,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Government & Law
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTAVIS,; HATCH-WAXMAN ACT; CORPORATE-CONTROL; SHAREHOLDERS; MARKET; GOVERNANCE; GREENMAIL; PAYMENT; DELAY; NO,"The cost of prescription drugs, a function of the nexus of patent law and antitrust law, has recently been thrust into the spotlight. In the shadow of the Federal Trade Commission's vigorous challenges to anticompetitive agreements between branded manufacturers and their potential generic competitors, a new player entered the administrative patent invalidity arena- noncompetitors, such as hedge fund managers, who, despite their reputation for seeking profit at all costs, asserted a seemingly puzzling altruistic interest in invalidating certain patents that prevent generic competitors from entering the market. In light of abuse of process accusations and calls for sanctions, this Note suggests that corporate law may facilitate an understanding of the role of noncompetitors in patent invalidation. Using the corporate law phenomenon of greenmail as an analogy, this Note argues that noncompetitors may actually facilitate competition and, as such, should be permitted to continue filing administrative patent challenges.",2016,Government & Law
Do Patent Challenges Increase Competition?,; GENERIC ENTRY; SETTLEMENT; INNOVATION; HOLDUP; PORTFOLIOS; LITIGATION; ACCURACY; PAYMENT; ACTAVIS; TROLLS,"As a general rule, judges and scholars believe settlement is a good thing. But for nearly a century, the Supreme Court has said that patent litigation is categorically different, since it offers the chance to increase competition by freeing the public from the burdens of a monopoly. Based on this theory, and in the hopes of seeing more patent litigation fought to completion, the Court has overturned long-standing common-law doctrines, declined to enforce otherwise-valid contracts, and in the recent case of Federal Trade Commission v Actavis, Inc-subjected patent settlements to scrutiny under the antitrust laws. Similar reasoning has resulted in legislative initiatives to encourage patent challenges, including the regulatory bounty for challenging pharmaceutical patents included in the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act and the administrative review procedures created by the 2011 America Invents Act. Moreover, scholars continue to call for reforms to provoke additional patent challenges, again asserting their supposed procompetitive benefits. This Article is the first to seriously scrutinize the claim that patent challenges lead to increased competition. It identifies a number of conditions that must hold for a patent challenge to provide this particular benefit, and evaluates the reasonableness of assuming that the procompetitive benefits of patent challenges are generally available. As it turns out, there are a number of ways these conditions can and regularly do fail. This Article synthesizes legal doctrine, recent empirical scholarship, and several novel case studies to identify categories of challenges in which the potential benefits for competition are smaller than previously thought or, in some cases, completely unavailable. This analysis has a number of implications for patent law and policy. First, it provides guidance for how the Patent Office should administer its new review authority under the America Invents Act. Second, it exposes weaknesses in judicially created policies intended to encourage more patent challenges. Third, it vindicates the present scope of the regulatory bounties provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act and cautions against recently proposed expansions of these incentives to other technology areas. Fourth, it sheds new light on the competitive consequences of patent settlements, and thus informs how the Court's recent Actavis decision should be applied in future cases.",2016,Government & Law
How Antitrust Law Can Make FRAND Commitments More Effective,; PATENT HOLDUP,"Much attention has been paid in recent years to legal issues arising from standard setting, assertion of standard-essential patents, and the requirements imposed by standard-setting organizations that standard-essential patents be licensed on reasonable terms. This Feature argues that a fundamental aspect of the antitrust laws, heretofore overlooked in this context, can play an important role in ensuring that the rules established by standard-setting organizations are effective in preventing owners of standard-essential patents from engaging in patent holdup. It has long been a basic principle of antitrust law that when firms collaborate to engage in conduct that has efficiency benefits, like standard-setting, they violate the antitrust laws if their collaboration also harms competition more than necessary to obtain the efficiency benefits. Both standard-setting organizations and their members can violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act if the organization's rules are ineffective in preventing owners of standard-essential patents from exploiting the monopoly power they gain as a result of the standard.",2018,Government & Law
Multi-party patent infringement litigation in China,direct infringement; indirect infringement; joint torts; multi-party infringement; patent; ,"Recently, parties have begun to implement patents separately to avoid legal liability in China. Multi-party infringing behaviours are more complicated to legally characterize than single-party patent infringement. Before the recently proposed legislative reform, the Patent Law of China did not clearly define indirect infringement. Chinese courts usually apply the joint torts rules to deal with those cases. However, by mixing the rule of joint injurious act with the rule of indirect patent infringement, the courts tend to confuse the two. Moreover, the newly drafted Revision of Patent Law, though it proposes adopting the indirect infringement concept, still borrows the joint torts rules to allocate liabilities. In these circumstances, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between joint torts and indirect infringement, and thus to clarify the rules for multi-party patent infringement.",2019,Government & Law
HOVERING BETWEEN INTERGOVERNMENTALISM AND UNIONIZATION: THE SHAPE OF UNITARY PATENTS,; ,"The unitary patent package is shielded against external judicial review in multiple ways. The norms providing the unitary patent its substantive contents, the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court (AUPC) and the European Patent Convention (EPC), are largely shielded from judicial review. European Patent Office (EPO) decisions cannot be subjected to direct scrutiny before EU courts either. Whereas the unitary patent and EPC systems will likely converge based on shared expert rule, EU law is at the same time subjected to fragmentation. Its core principles concerning legality and judicial review are being undermined in the process. However, through the preliminary ruling procedure, general EU norms and legal principles may still affect the package considerably more than envisioned by the architects thereof. Moreover, Brexit will require re-opening the package, and might open a window of opportunity for a political process leading to an improved design mending the current systemic defects.",2017,International Relations; Government & Law

Causal Responsibility and Patent Infringement,; ,"It is not uncommon for multiple parties in the stream of commerce-manufacturers, distributors, end users-to be involved in the infringement of a single patent. Yet courts continue to struggle with such scenarios. Attempts to deal with them-particularly when plaintiffs asserted so-called method patents, which cover specific steps, or actions-have produced results that defy commonsense notions of legal responsibility. In method patent cases, the patentee must clear much higher legal hurdles to prevail against a manufacturer who designed and supplied an infringing device than against an end user who simply bought that device and operated it as intended. The manufacturer can lose only upon proof of fault, while the user is subject to strict liability-a result that seems backwards because the manufacturer is clearly the more responsible party. Even greater difficulties arise when the manufacturer performs some steps of a method patent and the user performs the others, giving rise to a so-called divided infringement problem. One such case, Akamai v. Limelight, has been in litigation for over ten years and generated multiple appellate opinions, including a decision by the Supreme Court. Although the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit finally resolved Akamai in a fact-specific fashion, no comprehensive solution to the divided infringement problem is in sight. I explain that these problems persist because patent law formalistically clings to what I term the performer/non-performer distinction, which holds that physical performance of an act is the linchpin of legal accountability. I then contend that they can be solved by reading the Patent Act in view of the principle of causal responsibility, which pervades the law and rests on a firm philosophical foundation. Simply put, this principle holds that one is responsible for the actions of others that one has caused, leading to the legal effect of imputing the act of the causee (in patent cases, often the user) to the causer (e.g., the manufacturer). I draw on examples from criminal law and tort law to elucidate this principle and demonstrate its consistency with the Patent Act. I also maintain that applying causal responsibility in patent law would lead to three practical and sensible results. First, doing so would effectively lower the mens rea barriers needed to establish the liability of manufacturers who supply devices configured so that their only intended use by a passive customer results in the performance of steps of some method patent. Second, it would provide a path for resolving the vexing problem of divided infringement exemplified by Akamai. Third, the proposed approach may in some cases help to shift the burden of ensuring compliance with existing patents from end users to manufacturers, which is as it should be.",2017,Government & Law
TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,traditional knowledge; intellectual property rights; patent; copyright; TRIPS; ,"This paper is devoted to the analysis of possible options to ensure the protection of traditional knowledge through existing laws and legal systems in the field of intellectual property. For this purpose, the common problems that indigenous peoples and local communities face, when trying to ensure the protection of their traditional knowledge with the help of intellectual property law tools, are addressed. Separately, the possibility of using copyright, patents, industrial designs, trademarks, geographical indications, legislation on trade secrets and unfair competition are analyzed in detail. Examples are given for the implementation of traditional knowledge protection through intellectual property rights at the national level in selected countries, such as Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Ethiopia. Considerable attention is paid to the interpretation of the provisions of existing international legal acts in the field of intellectual property, in particular, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), as well as the Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. It is concluded that traditional intellectual property regimes do not provide adequate protection for traditional knowledge since contractual intellectual property rights are based on the concepts of an individual property.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics
(A)rising Above the Well-Pleaded Complaint: A Proposal to Reconsider the Jurisdictional Analysis of the Federal Circuit After the America Invents Act,; VORNADO,"At the intersection of civil procedure and patent law lies the unique appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit. Congress granted the Federal Circuit jurisdiction over patent law appeals in 28 U.S.C. 1295 (a) (1) with the passage of the Federal Courts Improvement Act in 1982. Since then, the Supreme Court has interpreted this statute by imposing a variation of the well-pleaded complaint rule onto patent law. Unfortunately, this interpretation has caused a few problems in the Federal Circuit's jurisprudence. First, it allows for jurisdiction to exist in cases where no patent claims exist because they have been rendered moot by settlement, dismissal, or motion. This aspect of the caselaw fails to account for the inherent differences between appellate and original jurisdiction. Second, it creates a complex and inconsistent analysis for litigants and courts to wade through, which wastes valuable resources. Third, under this rule, parties are able to manipulate appellate jurisdiction by modifying the language of their settlement agreements. The America Invents Act amended 28 U.S.C. 1295 in 2011, but it did not directly address these problems. Nonetheless, this Note argues that the amended version of the statute should be read to support a repudiation of the well-pleaded complaint rule in patent law. In its place, this Note asserts that jurisdiction should be assessed based on the procedural posture of the case at the time of appeal rather than the filing of the complaint, and jurisdiction should only lie in the Federal Circuit when there is a live patent case or controversy.",2015,Government & Law
The impact of international patent systems: Evidence from accession to the European Patent Convention,European Patent; Accession; Patents; Middle income countries; Regional patent system; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; TECHNOLOGY,"We analyze the impact of accession to the regional patent system established by the European Patent Convention (EPC) on 14 countries that acceded between 2000 and 2008. We look at changes in patenting behavior by domestic and foreign applicants at the national patent offices and the European Patent Office (EPO). We find a strong change in patent filing behavior among foreigners seeking patent protection in the accession states, substituting EPO patents for domestic patents immediately. However, there is no discernible reaction among domestic entities in terms of domestic filings, although we do find some evidence that applicants in accession states increased their propensity to file patents with the EPO post-accession. Inventors in accession countries also increase their patent filings slightly post-accession, both at the EPO and at the national offices.",2019,Business & Economics
"BOUNDARIES, EXTRATERRITORIALITY, AND PATENT INFRINGEMENT DAMAGES",; LAW,"Patents are generally considered to be the most territorial of all the various forms of intellectual property. Even patent law, however, has confronted issues involving the application of a U.S. patent to extraterritorial activity. The Supreme Court has expressed an interest in both issues the extraterritorial application of U.S. law and patent law. At times, these interests have intersected. Notwithstanding the Court's recent elaborations on extraterritoriality, the approach by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has been, at best, inconsistent. At times the court has afforded extraterritorial protection, even in the face of strong territorial language in the patent statute itself. At other times, however, it has approached the issue of extraterritoriality more restrictively, even when the statute itself expressly contemplates the regulation of activities outside of the United States. This dynamic has been addressed by myself and other scholars. More recently, however, the Federal Circuit has addressed the issue of patent damages for extraterritorial activities. These scenarios have arisen because there necessarily has been an act of domestic patent infringement. The damages theory advocated by the patent holder, however, has attempted to ensnare overseas sales, either under a lost-profits or reasonable-royalty theory. Additionally, the Federal Circuit has begun to address the appropriate scope of damages for infringement under section 271(f) of the Patent Act, a provision that defines infringement as the exportation of all the components of an invention, or a single component with no substantial noninfringing use, where it is to be assembled abroad. Necessarily, this provision contemplates the regulation of foreign markets through the domestic hook of acts of exportation. The Federal Circuit, nevertheless, rejected the patentee's requested remedy in this case. This Article turns to the issue of the extraterritorial reach of patent damages. It analyzes the Federal Circuit's recent pronouncements using the two-step method articulated by the Supreme Court in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community. This analysis suggests that damages for infringement under various aspects of the Patent Act can be treated differently with respect to extraterritoriality. This Article goes on to suggest that the Federal Circuit's approach lacks nuance to account for the particular economic and legal circumstances that differentiate the different infringement provisions at stake. It draws on earlier work where I advocated for a conflicts-based approach to extraterritorial application of U.S. patents, and extends that work to these scenarios, offering a more balanced approach to assessing whether damages are appropriate in these circumstances. Finally, this Article explores whether the various damages theories involved in these cases, regardless of the territorial limits, suggest it is time to revisit the foreseeability/proximate cause aspect of Rite-Hite. The theories of damages seem quite far removed from the actual acts of infringement, even if they occurred within the United States. Some scholars have begun work on this enterprise, and these cases suggest such consideration is ripe.",2017,Government & Law
Identifying and Preventing Biopiracy in Australia: patent landscapes and legal geographies for plants with Indigenous Australian uses,Indigenous knowledge; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; biological resources; patent trends; legal geography; biopiracy; access and benefit-sharing; Nagoya Protocol; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; MYOPORACEAE; KNOWLEDGE; ECOLOGY; LAND,"There are legal and moral imperatives to protect biological resources and the traditional knowledge' associated with them. These imperatives derive from complex legal geographies: international law (such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol), State and federal laws, Indigenous customary law, codes of ethics and research protocols. This paper reports on a patent landscape' analysis of patents that refer to Australian plant species for which there is Indigenous Australian knowledge. We have identified several patents of potential new biopiracy concern. The paper highlights the way in which actors can gain private property monopolies over biological resources and associated traditional knowledge, even though there are overlapping sovereign rights and Indigenous rights claims. Regulatory gaps need to be closed nationally to fully govern the diverse human-plant bio-geographies in Australia. Further, Indigenous laws and governance have largely been ignored by these actors. We suggest that the introduction of disclosure of origin' requirements in patent applications, sui generis Indigenous knowledge protections, the development of biocultural protocols, and a more nationally consistent system for access and benefit-sharing' are required to ensure more fair and equitable' use of plants and Indigenous knowledge in/from Australia, and to ensure the recognition of Indigenous rights to knowledge.",2017,Geography

"The Hamiltonian Origins of the US Patent System, and Why They Matter Today",; ADMINISTRATIVE-LAW,"I revisit one of the earliest administrative functions of the United States government, the granting of patents, to show why the U.S. Patent Office fits so poorly with the contemporary model of an Executive Branch agency in the modern Administrative State. In parallel with other early proto-agencies the Patent Office participated in the most important job of the new national government: economic development. Because of the importance of this policy, and the limited power of the new federal government, Congress, courts, and the executive branch emphasized concerted action rather than separation of powers. The Patent Office had been performing its basic function for nearly one hundred years when the modern administrative revolution began its sweep though the federal government. The modern administrative state was created to counterbalance the emergent power of large, concentrated industries; it had little relationship to the original Patent Office mandate from Hamiltonian times. As a consequence, contemporary administrative law is a poor fit for the Patent Office. Administrative law, especially the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), governs power relations between federal agencies and the industries they regulate, with courts often acting as referee. But the Patent Office grants government-sanctioned property rights to dispersed inventors in an extremely wide variety of industries, and lets private investment, transactions, and enforcement take over. Since its founding, the Patent Office has been charged not with regulating concentrated industry, but with handing out a small dollop of state power to dispersed parties in the form of individual property rights. Although some features of the modern administrative apparatus surely apply to the Patent Office it is overall best left to the looser-fitting understandings of the Hamiltonian economic development state.",2019,Government & Law
Thriving in a new patent world: Mitigating the unintended consequences of the America Invents Act,America Invents Act (AIA); patents; product portfolio; systems; systems thinking; unintended consequences; intellectual property; ,"Our article epitomizes systems thinking not only to identify possible unintended consequences of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), but also to offer suggestions mitigating their impact. Employing two-loop, generic system archetypes, our intent is to help stakeholders in intellectual property (IP) understand some of the nuances influencing the patent lifecycle linked to AIA. Building on the lingua franca used in patent law, our article highlights four important changes: being the first-to-file for protection; eliminating best mode disclosure; expanding the definition of prior art; and expanding post-grant review. Armed with a better understanding of the system issues imbedded in the legislation, innovators and entrepreneurs can develop strategies to deal with the attendant issues. For example, the tragedy of the commons associated with first-to-file highlights the need to increase R&D resources; else, over time incremental innovation will inevitably dominate efforts to modify the patent portfolio. Overall, AIA represents a step forward in harmonizing the US with the rest of the world while it increases the transparency of the legal maze that remains patent law; however, the changes bring allocation issues, secrecy, and time pressure to the forefront of the conversation about new product development. Recognition of these impacts is relevant worldwide for anyone contemplating a US patent or any entity attempting to maintain a viable portfolio of intellectual property.",2019,Business & Economics
Are patent fees effective at weeding out low-quality patents?,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; INNOVATION; INDICATORS; CITATIONS; ECONOMICS; RENEWAL; RIGHTS; FORUM,"The paper investigates whether patent fees are an effective mechanism to deter the filing of low-quality patent applications. The study analyzes the effect on patent quality of the Patent Law Amendment Act of 1982, which resulted in a substantial increase in patenting fees at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Results from a series of difference-in-differences regressions suggest that the increase in fees led to a weeding out of low-quality patents. About 10% of patents in the lowest quality decile were filtered out, with the effect concentrated in the patents of firms whose overall patent portfolio was medium to large (more than 20 patents). The study has strong policy implications in the current context of concerns about declines in patent quality.",2018,Business & Economics
The Federal Question in Patent-License Cases,; JURISDICTION; RETHINKING; COURTS,"The patent law has long recognized a patent owner's ability to license some interest in the patent by granting to others permission to tread upon the patent owner's property rights without legal consequence. When one of the parties to a patent license decides to seek remedies from the other party for a license harm, the resulting litigation may be a patent-infringement case with a contract issue or a contract case with a patent issue. In most cases, the patent owner brings her suit against the licensee in federal court, alleging that the licensee breached the license contract and, as a result, now infringes the patent. However, a patent owner, as the master of her suit, may choose to bring it in state court and raise only a contract claim governed by state law. The license agreement, by its very nature, implipates patent issues,but it is not always clear when a state suit like this one may be removed to federal court. This is especially true after a recent Supreme Court case, Gunn v. Minton, and amendments to the relevant jurisdictional statutes as part of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011. The jurisdictional rules governing these types of cases are convoluted, clunky, and heavily criticized. In this Article, I argue that the current jurisdictional rules are unnecessary and burdensome in patent-license cases, and I propose a new rule that would place patent-license cases even those that would be considered state contract cases under the existing framework in federal courts with exclusive appeals to the Federal Circuit. Ultimately, the reduced burden on litigants and courts, the increased clarity of the law, and the structural advantages for the Federal Circuit as it continues to develop an important body of licensing law outweigh any federalism costs.",2015,Government & Law
Are biosimilars patentable?,Biologics; biosimilars; FDA; law; patent; pharmaceuticals; ,"Introduction: This paper explores whether, and under what circumstances, a biosimilar approved in the United States under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (hereafter BPCIA') can be patented. The possibility that a biosimilar product could have meaningful patent protection arises from specific requirements for biosimilarity under the BPCIA, which account for the fact that manufacturing processes of biologics are inherently imprecise. The requirements for biosimilar approval may provide sufficient leeway to a biosimilar applicant to patent structural or formulation differences that provide non-clinical but business-relevant advantages over the reference molecule, such as improved shelf-life or ease of manufacture, without compromising clinical biosimilarity.Areas covered: Examination of the BPCIA and related Acts, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance papers, case law, patent database searching, and relevant scholarly articles.Expert opinion: Legislative and regulatory requirements for the approval of a biosimilar under the BPCIA are focused on clinical results and allow a degree of leeway for differences to exist between a biosimilar's structure and non-clinical components and those of the biosimilar's reference molecule. This leeway can be exploited to provide the biosimilar with potentially patentable business-relevant advantages over its reference product while maintaining clinical biosimilarity to the reference product.",2016,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
WORKING WITHOUT CHEVRON: THE PTO AS PRIME MOVER,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; PATENT; QUESTIONS; SEARCH; COURT; LAW,"Through a proliferation of post-issuance administrative proceedings, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has become a major player in the fate of patents after their initial examination and grant. In combination with the PTO's more traditional roles in initial examination and general guidance, new post-issuance proceedings enable the PTO to help steer the development of substantive patent law even without general provision of high-level Chevron deference for the agency's interpretations of substantive aspects of the U.S. Patent Act. Contrary to some commentators' suggestions, congressional authorization for new post issuance proceedings does not appear to have included an implicit delegation of interpretive authority generally warranting Chevron deference on such matters. But the PTO can still accomplish much with lower-level deference and the advantages that its common first mover position provides.",2016,Government & Law
ADMINISTRATIVE POWER IN THE ERA OF PATENT STARE DECISIS,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; SYSTEM; TAX; DEFERENCE; ACCURACY; CHEVRON; MEAD; LAW,"The elaborate adjudicatory proceedings set up by the America Invents Act of 2011 (AIA) have thrust the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) squarely into the patent-litigation process. The AIA proceedings, conducted by the newly formed PTO Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), are now a formidable competitor to district court litigation. The executive branch has further enhanced PTO and PTAB power by vigorously asserting the agency's prerogatives with respect to certain aspects of these proceedings. Despite the formality of the AIA proceedings, the agency's lawyers have steered clear of asking for Chevron deference on legal issues decided in these proceedings. Although the executive branch's caution may reflect the unusual institutional structure of the PTAB, PTAB decisionmaking could be structured in a manner that should, under conventional administrative law principles, merit Chevron deference. In all likelihood, the chief roadblock to Chevron is not formal administrative law but specific challenges within the patent regime. Many judges on the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviews all appeals from PTO decisions, have long been reluctant to apply conventional administrative law. Perhaps more surprisingly, the Supreme Court's recent decisionmaking in the area has emphasized its own earlier cases (including cases predating the Administrative Procedure Act) and stare decisis over conventional administrative law. Given potentially hostile courts, the costs of the PTO leadership expending the political capital necessary to embed the PTO more fully into the administrative state may exceed the benefits. At best, in those cases where stare decisis is not implicated or is on the agency's side, the PTO may be able to exercise indirect influence on the Court through the Office of the Solicitor General.",2016,Government & Law
A Bridge over the Patent Trolls: Using Antitrust Laws to Rein in Patent Aggregators,; ,"Patents, by their very nature, are a type of monopoly, and are so important to our country's intellectual and technological advancement that the Founding Fathers granted Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to.. inventors the exclusive right to their respective.. discoveries.' But in recent decades, that imperative has lost its footing. Mass patent aggregators, companies that compile, hoard, and assert patent rights without contributing products to the world have contorted that vision. Patent Trolls assemble portfolios of weak patents to corner and dominate technological spaces, crowding out innovators and demanding extortionate licensing fees from unsuspecting targets. Federal antitrust laws forbid improper accumulation and assertion of monopoly power, which is precisely how trolls' business model operates. And yet, courts traditionally have not found a parent portfolio to constitute a relevant market under the Sherman Act. This Note explains why they should, and in doing so examines two cases between identical litigants, the latter of which may provide a roadmap for pursuing antitrust counterclaims against serial patent assertion entities.",2016,Government & Law
Remarks on the proposed Fourth Amendment to the Patent Law of China,patent law; China; law reform; ,"The enactment of the Patent Law of People's Republic of China ('Patent Law') in 1984 and its several subsequent revisions have strengthened patent protection and promoted innovation, yet problems and challenges persist. On 10 August 2012, the State Intellectual Property Office ('SIPO') published a notice calling for public opinions and suggestions concerning the Patent Law's revision. SIPO then published the first draft of the proposed Fourth Amendment to the Patent Law on 3 April 2014, followed by the second draft on 1 April 2015. On 2 December 2015, the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council published the third draft of the Fourth Amendment of the Patent Law to the People's Congress Standing Committee ('the Draft').

DECOUPLING PATENT LAW,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; TROLLS; SYSTEM; COURT,"Patent law is applied in a variety of settings, including the Patent Office in determining an applicant's initial entitlement to a patent, the courts in enforcing patent rights, and the Patent Office in reconsidering previously issued patents. These settings differ significantly in their functions, timing, structure, procedures, and decision makers. Yet, identical patent law rules are generally applied in identical ways in each setting. This norm of coupled patent law is presumed, with little theoretical justification. Problems arising from the norm of coupled patent law may underlie current disagreement among Congress, the Supreme Court, the Federal Circuit, and commentators about the optimal design of patent law. Simply put, it may be impossible to develop a single, optimal set of rules to be applied uniformly in the very dfferent settings of the patent system. Thus, for patent law to be optimal in practice, rather than just in theory, it may need to be tailored for the different contexts and decision makers of the patent system. Decoupling patent law to apply different rules, standards, tests, presumptions, etc. in the dfferent settings of the patent system, like patent acquisition in the Patent Office and patent enforcement in the courts, may be warranted This Article makes the normative case for decoupled patents as a tool of patent law design and provides an initial framework for implementing it, addressing statutory and practical concerns.",2017,Government & Law
Weighing intellectual property: Can we balance the social costs and benefits of patenting?,Balance; innovation; patent law; patent policy; social costs and benefits of intellectual property; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; LAW,"The scale is the most famous emblem of the law, including intellectual property (IP). Because IP rights impose social costs on the public by limiting access to protected work, the law can be justified only to the extent that, on balance, it encourages enough creation and dissemination of new works to offset those costs. The scale is thus a potent rhetorical trope of fairness and objectivity, but also an instrument the law thinks with - one that is constantly invoked to justify or to question the extent of available IP protection. The balancing act that underlies the legitimacy of IP is, however, literally impossible to perform. Because we are unable to measure the benefits that IP has for inventors or the costs it has for the public, the scale has nothing to weigh. It conveys a clear sense that IP law can be balanced, but in fact propagates only a visible simulacrum of balance - one that is as empty as it is powerful.",2019,History & Philosophy of Science
"PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN SPACE: OLD ANSWERS TO NEW QUESTIONS.",; ,"This comment critically analyzes international space law in the context of intellectual property. The issues explored, current and future, are at the crossroads of the international space legal framework and U.S. intellectual property law. The first stage of the analysis includes a brief history of space law, introducing the U.N. treaties on space activities and taking a hard look at the founding principles they enshrine. An analytical overview of the International Space Station Agreement follows, introducing the present application of space law to issues of intellectual property. This overview further considers the fundamental principles of U.S. intellectual property, especially patent law, including the peculiar mandate of the Patents in Space Act. Both preceding sections highlight issues specifically affecting intellectual property and its development or enforcement in outer space and reveal the ramifications of this complex topic. After dissecting the relevant legal norms, the comment explores the future of the interaction between space and intellectual property, building upon the preceding critical approach to examine two issues: orbital patents and flags of convenience for patent infringers in space. Having delineated a number of interpretive problems that scarcely find comfort in the language of the applicable law, the comment concludes that commercial development and innovation in outer space will either require an update of international space law principles or a conscious disregard of its provisions.",2019,Government & Law
"Protecting Profits Post-Patent Expiry: ACCC v Pfizer, Patents and Competition Law",; MARKET,"In the lead up to patent expiry, pharmaceutical companies often engage in strategies designed to delay the production of generic medicines. This article considers whether such conduct is likely to be caught by competition law prohibitions. The article focuses on the recent Full Federal Court decision in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd. The court's analysis of the conduct engaged in by Pfizer Australia is interesting in its own right. Further, the judgment provides guidance as to whether or not a firm will be viewed as possessing market power in the period leading up to patent expiry. The judgment also indicates that a firm may escape liability on the basis that it acted to protect profits, not substantially lessen competition. The article concludes by identifying other strategies employed by pharmaceutical companies and, drawing on the Pfizer decision, considers the legality of such practices.",2019,Government & Law
Patent Right in China: Influences from the West and China's Responses,Patent; China; SEP; Antitrust; Patent law; COUNTERFEITING TRADE AGREEMENT; TEXT,"At the beginning, China was reluctant to establish a patent law system. Patent is a concept of Western origin, and Chinese patent law has been developed under foreign pressure. Reform and development with respect to patent rights and enforcement nevertheless have become an important area to attract foreign investment. Over time, the country has realized that the utilitarian nature of this private right suits its development needs and it now fully embraces the concept. Patent law has become one of the main targets of the government in its attempt to establish a modern legal system. It has also become a symbol of the country's technological advancement. Patent rules in China are now very similar to those of its Western counterparts. The enforcement mechanism has been reformed with a view to enhancing patent rights. The administrative remedy of patent infringement is a unique feature in China's patent enforcement system, which has its drawbacks. By contrast, the establishment of Intellectual Property Courts is a clear sign of the development of a more autonomous, independent, and professional judiciary in the area of patent law. The most watched area with regard to the patent system at this moment is the government's application of antitrust law in the patent licensing practices, especially in the field of standard and essential patents (SEPs). The trend of the cases in this field suggests that China is very active in enforcing its antitrust laws. On the one hand, China is enhancing the protection of patent rights when domestic patent holders are gaining ground in terms of the quality of their patents. On the other hand, China is using its antitrust law to limit the power of foreign SEP holders. From this perspective, the Chinese government is using antitrust laws to achieve what it cannot do by patent law. Under the TRIPS Agreement, there is no room for discriminatory treatment in patent law. Through the aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws, however, the Chinese authorities can limit the patent rights of foreign holders while at the same time empowering domestic patentees. Legal rules in China in the field of patent law are an interesting case study. China accepted patent law from the West and also created many unique responses along the way. Many of these unique responses fulfilled their temporal missions and gradually became less important. Now China is using another Western legal concept, antitrust law, to create the optimal patent law environment for its needs.",2016,Area Studies; Government & Law
Reasoned Decisionmaking vs. Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office,; ,"In the late 1990s, the Patent Office began describing the primary mission of its Patent Business as being to help customers get patents-an administrative approach widely perceived as leading to an exceptionally profligate era of patent granting. Intellectual cover for the agency's approach was provided by the academic theory that the Patent Office could follow a rational ignorance approach to patent granting-that the agency could rationally issue patents even where it had gathered only sparse information concerning the merits of claimed inventions and had spent little effort in reasoning through and explaining its decisions to grant rights. Modern administrative law, however, generally requires agencies to act only through the process of reasoned decisionmaking, which demands that agencies engage in careful study of the issues presented by any proposed agency action and provide reasoned explanations for their decisions. On both legal and policy grounds, reasoned decisionmaking provides a far superior polestar for guiding the administrative processes of the Patent Office than any theory based on rational ignorance. As a matter of law, the Congress since 1836 has repeatedly rejected any policy favoring the grant of patents through bureaucratic ignorance. As a matter of policy, reasoned decisionmaking provides more comprehensive guidance to the Patent Office not only on how much effort the agency should expend acquiring information, but also on how the agency should exercise its powers in determining the validity of claims to intellectual property rights.",2019,Government & Law

This literature typically omits patent law from the argument, reflecting an implicit assumption that patent protection poses no threat to free speech. This assumption is wrong. As this Article will explain, patents can restrict free speech just as much as copyrights and trademarks. Indeed, patents often pose an even greater threat to speech than do copyrights and trademarks: precisely because people assume that patents pose no threat to speech, patent law has developed none of the doctrinal safeguards for free speech that copyright law and trademark law have incorporated. This Article makes two contributions. First, it makes the point that patents are not exceptional and raise the same free speech issues as the rest of IP law. Second, it proposes some doctrinal limits on patent protection to mitigate the speech-restrictive effects of patent law.",2019,Government & Law
THE SUPREME COURT'S QUIET REVOLUTION IN INDUCED PATENT INFRINGEMENT,; ,"The Supreme Court over the last decade or so has reengaged with patent law. While much attention has been paid to the Court's reworking of what constitutes patent-eligible subject matter and enhancing tools to combat patent trolls, what many have missed is the Court's reworking of the contours of active inducement of patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. 271(b). The Court has taken the same number of 271(b) cases as subject matter eligibility cases-four. Yet this reworking has not garnered much attention in the literature. This Article offers the first comprehensive assessment of the Court's efforts to define active inducement. In so doing, it identifies the surprising significance of the Court's most recent case, Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Systems; Inc., where the Court held that a good faith belief on the part of the accused inducer that the relevant patent is invalid cannot negate the mental state required for inducement the intent to induce acts of infringement. In so doing, the Court moved away from its policy of encouraging challenges to patent validity as articulated in Lear, Inc. v. Adkins and its progeny. This step away from Lear is significant and surprising, particularly where critiques of the patent system suggest there are too many invalid patents creating issues for competition. This Article critiques these aspects of Commil and then addresses lingering, unanswered questions. In particular, this Article suggests that a good faith belief that the induced acts are not infringing, which remains as a defense, should only act as a shield against past damages and not against prospective relief such as injunctions or ongoing royalties. The courts so far have failed to appreciate this important temporal dynamic.",2016,Government & Law
International harmonization of the patent-issuing rules,R&D competition; Patent laws and legislation; Intellectual property rights; Patent priority rules; Sequential innovation; Management of technological innovation and R&D; INNOVATION,"Using a dynamic model of patent races for two sequential innovations, Scotchmer & Green (1990) compared the effect on R&D incentives of the two patent-issuing rules, first-to-invent and first-to-file, and found first-to-file more conducive to R&D. We show that their result depends on their assumption of fixed innovation probabilities. When innovation probabilities are endogenous for the intermediate invention, their result can be reversed. Our analysis has the obvious implications on the evaluation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (2011), whereby the U.S. switched from first-to-invent to first-to-file. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Parallel importation of patented products in Thailand: the need for the new patent exhaustion regime in the light of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC),exhaustion doctrine; parallel importation; Thai patent law; parallel patents; exhaustion of patent rights; ASEAN Economic Community; free movement of goods; LAW,"This article considers the problem of parallel importation of patented products in Thailand in the light of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). One of the objectives of the AEC is to promote the free movement of goods and a single market within the Southeast Asia region. But, the exhaustion provision in section 36(7) of the Thai Patent Act 1979 makes it difficult for Thailand to achieve such an objective because it is unclear whether this provision is applied as national exhaustion or international exhaustion. Also, this exhaustion provision can only apply to the petty patent and the patent for invention, but cannot apply to the design patent, so the design patent owner can prevent parallel importation of products embodying the registered design from other ASEAN countries into Thailand. In order to achieve the AEC objective, this article argues that a regional exhaustion approach like that of the EU is appropriate for Thailand, but the wording of the current exhaustion provision does not support the application of a regional exhaustion approach. Hence, this article suggests that changes should be made to several provisions in the Thai Patent Act 1979 in order to make them compatible with the regional exhaustion approach. Such a change should ensure that the exhaustion provision can be applied to the design patent. Also, the proposed change should ensure that if the products are manufactured by the holder of a compulsory licence in another country and imported into Thailand without the consent of the patent owner, then the patent owner in Thailand should be able to prevent it. The additional legal measure, which provides a means of access to the complaints procedures of the relevant safety authorities in the circumstance where the patented products imported from other ASEAN countries are not safe, should be introduced. Also, a change should be made to some border measures provisions in order to allow such provisions to apply where the imported products infringed the patent right in the same manner as they apply in the context of trademark and copyright.",2017,Government & Law
Method Patent Exceptionalism,; POLICY; SCOPE,"Inventive methods and processes have long received hostile treatment by the patent system. Courts have been skeptical of these claims because of the potential for overbreadth of the patent, particularly if the method is delineated in functional terms. This categorical skepticism, however, fails to consider the technological specificity of such concerns. For example, the pharmaceutical industry views method claims, particularly methods of use and treatment, as weaker, second-tier forms of protection. Patents on the chemical compound itself offers greater downstream protection over all uses of the compound. Nevertheless, process claims have received differential treatment in patent law. Congress has adopted process-specific provisions. Notwithstanding that Congress has often legislated specific provisions for process claims, the Federal Circuit has gone further, affording patented processes exceptional and usually detrimental treatment, even though the patent statute is neutral as to the nature of the invention. Moreover, the exceptional treatment creates inconsistencies in the law. For example, the Federal Circuit has stated that it would not be possible to infringe a patent on a method by selling or offering to sell the invention, even though the law is clear that method claims are subject to patent exhaustion (the first sale doctrine) and to the on-sale bar. Similar exceptional treatment arises for the extraterritorial protection for U.S. patents and the manner courts handle divided infringement scenarios, where more than one party is involved in the act of infringement. Ironically, the one area where treating methods differently would be most appropriate assessing patent eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101-is the one place where the Supreme Court has conflated patented methods with other types of inventions. This Article offers the first comprehensive exploration of method patent exceptionalism and posits ways to eliminate the differential treatment of method claims to put them on equal footing with other types of inventions.",2017,Government & Law
ASSIGNED ALL MY RIGHTS AWAY: The Overuse of Assignment Provisions in Contracts for Patent Rights,; ,"Many companies rely on the use of assignment clauses to grant themselves ownership of intellectual property created by their employees. Many of these contracts target patent ownership rights, are overly broad, and prevent employee-inventors from receiving fair value for the work they provide to their employers. When the clause collects patent ownership rights, these contracts reduce the motivation to innovate and restrict the mobility of employees. As a result, many scholars challenge the principle of assigning away intellectual property in initial employment contracts. Only some of this criticism is warranted because businesses may validly claim some of the inventions created by their employee-inventors. Many businesses hire with the intent to innovate a specific invention, and basic principles of agency law and shop right doctrines would indicate that the invention belongs to the business. Without that invention, many businesses may struggle to survive and raise revenue. Because economic realities have changed since the Framers wrote the Patent Clause into the Constitution and Congress initially passed the Patent Act, both the employer and the employee-inventor share rights to many inventions, possessing legal rights to the invention and personhood rights to the invention, respectively. To resolve this conflict, corporations should modify existing contracting practice to rely on right of preemption provisions, courts of all levels should consistently interpret contract law in light of patent law terms of art when patent ownership suits reach them, and Congress should authorize the ability to terminate patent rights assignments to empower employee-inventors and promote more equitable consideration and compensation for inventions created by their employees.",2018,Government & Law
Patent Court Specialization,; FEDERAL-COURTS; SEPARATION; CIRCUIT; POWERS; QUESTIONS; VALIDITY; SYSTEM; POLICY,"A central issue in administrative law is how to balance power between executive-branch agencies and the courts that review their decisions, both to preserve separation of powers and ensure good decisionmaking. In patent law, however, such a balance does not exist. When Congress created the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in 1982, it intended for the court to be a generalist institution that heard appeals from a variety of agencies. But since that time, the Federal Circuit has become a specialized court, with patent-related matters now comprising the overwhelming majority of its docket. Over the years, this specialization has led to various problems, including disregard for the Patent and Trademark Office's (PTO's) autonomy, political activism, and judicial legislating. The Federal Circuit has consolidated power to the point that no other branch of government serves as an effective check, raising separation-of-powers concerns. Consequently, it is important that Congress act to restore a balance of power in patent law. This could be accomplished by granting the PTO greater rulemaking authority to limit the Federal Circuit's ability to engage in judicial legislation, to facilitate public participation, and to generally serve as a counterbalance to the powerful court.",2019,Government & Law
DATA-GENERATING PATENTS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; TRADE SECRETS; HUMAN-GENOME; LAW; ECONOMICS; PROTECTION; SEARCH; SCOPE; ASSOCIATION; COMPETITION,"Patents and trade secrets are often considered economic substitutes. Under this view, inventors can decide either to maintain an invention as a trade secret or to seek a patent and disclose to the public the details of the invention. However, a handful of scholars have recognized that because the patent disclosure requirements are not always rigorous, inventors may sometimes be able to keep certain aspects of an invention secret, yet still receive a patent to the invention as a whole. Here, we provide further insight into how trade secrets and patents may act as complements. Specifically, we introduce the concept of data-generating patents, which refer to patents on inventions involving technologies that by design generate valuable data through their operation or use. For instance, genetic tests and medical devices produce data about patients. Internet search engines and social networking websites generate data about the interests of consumers. When data-generating inventions are patented, and the patentee enjoys market power over the invention, by implication, the patentee also effectively enjoys market power over the data generated by the invention. Trade secret law further protects the patentee's market power over the data, even where that data is in a market distinct from the patented invention and especially after the patent expires or is invalidated. We contend that the use of patents and trade secrets as complements in this manner may sometimes yield socially harmful results. We identify the conditions under which such results occur and make several recommendations to mitigate their effects.",2017,Government & Law
Administering Patent Law,; ,"Ten years ago, few people-with the exception of a handful of visionary academics-spent much time thinking about the significance of administrative law to the patent system. Today, administrative law issues pervade the patent system, from examiners and patent judges up to the United States Supreme Court. At the same time, modern administrative law itself faces a series of challenges that call into question its fundamental premises, such as the degree of deference that courts should grant agencies and the amount of political control that is constitutionally permissible or required. What does all this mean for the future of patent law? Thanks to the support of the David F. Hellwege fund at the Iowa Law School Foundation, this Issue of the Iowa Law Review contains an amazing array of scholarship on these topics from some of today's brightest and most prominent patent law thinkers.",2019,Government & Law

Missing from these investigations, however, is what this paper terms the legal perspective, an understanding of how the law and its attendant mechanisms impact university technology transfer. Specifically, the paper reviews the extant legal scholarship and provides examples of how case law, legal structures, and the unique nature of intellectual property law affects technology transfer, as well as higher education policy and management. Throughout, we propose critical questions for future investigation, which serve to form a cross-disciplinary research agenda that can contribute fresh insights to scholarly and policy discussions related to the role of universities in economic and social development.",2016,Engineering; Business & Economics
"DO ABSTRACT IDEAS HAVE THE NEED, THE NEED FOR SPEED?: AN EXAMINATION OF ABSTRACT IDEAS AFTER ALICE",; ,"Imagine you invented a way to perform mathematical calculations all over the world simultaneously. Now, imagine that you cannot patent your invention because it was compared to, and found to contain, the same idea as an abacus.(1) This scenario was the outcome of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International.(2) In coming to its decision in Alice, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted a two-part test that it had previously utilized to analyze the patentability of laws of nature to determine whether the patent at issue met the subject matter patentability standards of 101 of the Patent Act. Determining the claim contained an abstract idea, the Court then addressed whether the invention was a patentable application and found it was not because generic computer implementation did not add significantly more to the underlying idea. Since Alice, courts have invalidated a number of patents for failing to meet this criteria-arguably turning from the plain meaning of the Patent Act and congressional intent. Utilizing the Alice framework, courts have dismissed patent infringement claims in the pleading stages upon labeling them as abstract and citing reasoning as well as utilizing terminology that is more indicative of a 102 or 103 Patent Act analysis. While an argument can be made that proactively dismissing some claims in the pleading stages could reduce the prevalence of patent trolls and improve the efficiency of the patent process, this Note argues that the widespread proclivity of courts to invalidate patents under 101 by utilizing language indicative of 102 and 103 analysis robs patent holders of the ability to have their claims analyzed under proper standards and injects subjective and uncertain criteria into the patent infringement analysis that could be avoided by implementing other analytical methods. As a remedy to the inclusion of 102 and 103 factors in the subject matter patentability analysis, this Note advocates that a substantial increase in speed or efficiency generated by an invention should be taken into account in determining if the invention adds significantly more to the idea. This would create a tangible bright-line test that would allow the claim to move forward and be analyzed under more suitable Patent Act sections.",2015,Government & Law
DOES THE US PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE GRANT TOO MANY BAD PATENTS?: EVIDENCE FROM A QUASI-EXPERIMENT,; INNOVATION,"Many believe the root cause of the patent system's dysfunction is that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO or Agency) is issuing too many invalid patents that unnecessarily drain consumer welfare. Concerns regarding the Agency's overgranting tendencies have recently spurred the Supreme Court to take a renewed interest in substantive patent law and have driven Congress to enact the first major patent reform act in over sixty years. Policymakers, however, have been modifying the system in an effort to increase patent quality in the dark. As there exists little to no compelling empirical evidence the PTO is actually overgranting patents, lawmakers are left trying to fix the patent system without even understanding the root causes of the system's shortcomings. This Article begins to rectify this deficiency, advancing the conversation along two dimensions. First, it provides a novel theoretical source for a granting bias on the part of the Agency, positing that the inability of the PTO to finally reject a patent application may create an incentive for the resource-constrained Agency to allow additional patents. Second, this Article attempts to explore, through a sophisticated natural experiment framework, whether the Agency is in fact acting on this incentive and overgranting patents. Our findings suggest that the PTO is biased toward allowing patents. Moreover, our results suggest the PTO is targeting its overgranting tendencies toward those patents it stands to benefit from the most that is, those patent applications directed toward technologies that have historically had high repeat-filing rates, such as information, computer, and health-related technologies. Our findings provide policymakers with much-needed evidence that the PTO is indeed overgranting patents. Our results also suggest that the literature has overlooked a substantial source of Agency bias; hence, recent fixes to improve patent quality will not achieve their desired outcome of extinguishing the PTO's overgranting proclivities.",2015,Government & Law
"A Career in Patent Law: At the Cutting Edge of Science, but Not at the Bench",; ,"Patent law is an area that many people move into after obtaining a PhD in biomedical science. Close to the cutting edge of research, patent agents draft detailed descriptions of new biotechnology inventions required for patent applications and engage with patent offices during the review process known as patent prosecution. Jobs are also available as patent examiners who examine these patent applications, and it is common for individuals to move between the two jobs.

Therefore, in the latest Draft Patent Law Amendment, the 'notice and takedown' rule originally used in copyright law has now been transplanted into patent law to tackle online patent infringement issues. In our view, because there is a clear distinction between infringement of patent right and infringement of copyright, the notice and takedown rule cannot simply be transplanted without creating an unnecessary burden on internet service providers. Based on an evaluation of court rulings of the People's Republic of China, this article will provide recommendations for improving the application of the rule.",2018,Government & Law
Scientific Realism and the Patent System,Patents; Inventions; Realism; Anti-realism; Nature; Causation; ANTICOMMONS,"The patent system appears to make three ontological assumptions often associated with scientific realism: there is a natural world that is independent of human knowledge and technology; invented products can be unobservable things; and invented products have causal powers. Although a straightforward reading of patent laws implies these ontological commitments, it is not at all clear that what the patent system has to say about the world has any bearing on issues of scientific realism. While realists might embrace the patent system's apparent ontology as providing additional support for their view, anti-realists could propose an alternative interpretation of patent law that does not involve realist ontological commitments. Thus, questions about the patent system's ontology depend on whether one takes patent laws at face value or defends an interpretation of patent law motivated by philosophical theory. Philosophers of science should pay attention to the practice of patenting, even if they ultimately reject the patent system's apparent ontology and offer an alternative interpretation.",2016,History & Philosophy of Science
How patent law reform can improve affordability and accessibility of medicines in South Africa: Four medicine case studies,; ,"South Africa (SA) is in the process of amending its patent laws. Since its 2011 inception, Fix the Patent Laws, a coalition of 40 patient groups, has advocated for reform of SA's patent laws to improve affordability of medicines in the country. Building on two draft policies (2013, 2017) and a consultative framework (2016) for reform of SA's patent laws, Cabinet approved phase 1 of the Intellectual Property Policy of the Republic of South Africa on 23 May 2018. Fix the Patent Laws welcomed the policy, but highlighted concerns regarding the absence of important technical details, as well as the urgent need for government to develop bills, regulations and guidelines to provide technical detail and to codify and implement patent law reform in the country. In this article, we explore how reforms proposed in SA's new intellectual property policy could improve access to medicine through four medicine case studies.",2019,General & Internal Medicine
Litigation-Related Issues Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act,Hatch-Waxman Act; Infringement; Patent dance; Patents; Litigation; Inter Partes Review; BPCIA; ,"The chapter summarizes the pertinent provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the Act) that relate to patent issues, including the so-called patent dance, the two waves of litigation, and due to its significance to biosimilar practice, inter partes review. The chapter first examines the statutory framework of the Act that governs the contemplated exchange of confidential-information between the sponsor and biosimilar applicant resulting in the list of patents to be litigated-the infamous patent dance. It also discusses the two distinct waves of litigation that the Act envisioned, and the 180-day notice of commercialization that triggers the second wave. Also provided are suggestions for both sponsors and applicants on preparing for litigation under the Act. The chapter then reviews the leading cases that have addressed the workings of the Act including the information exchange process, the patent dance, discovery, and remedies. Significantly, the Supreme Court ruled that information exchange and patent dance provisions are optional, and the 180-day notice of commercialization can be given at any time after FDA filing. Certain ramifications of the decision are explored in the cases discussed. The chapter concludes with a discussion of Hatch-Waxman safe harbor, which is applicable to biologics/biosimilars and unchanged under the Act, and inter partes review, which will continue to play a significant role in biosimilars' attempts to avoid district court litigation for their proposed products.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
'Government Patent Use': A Legal Approach To Reducing Drug Spending,; C VIRUS-INFECTION; NATIONAL-HEALTH; SOFOSBUVIR; PROGRAMS; ACCESS,"The high cost of patent-protected brand-name drugs can strain budgets and curb the widespread use of new medicines. An example is the case of direct-acting antiviral drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C. While prices for these drugs have come down in recent months, they still create barriers to treatment. Additionally, prescribing restrictions imposed by insurers put patients at increased risk of medical complications and contribute to transmission of the hepatitis C virus. We propose that the federal government invoke its power under an existing  government patent use law to reduce excessive prices for important patent-protected medicines. Using this law would permit the government to procure generic versions of patented drugs and in exchange pay the patent-holding companies reasonable royalties to compensate them for research and development. This would allow patients in federal programs, and perhaps beyond, to be treated with inexpensive generic medicines according to clinical need-meaning that many more patients could be reached for no more, and perhaps far less, money than is currently spent. Another benefit would be a reduction in the opportunity for companies to extract monopoly profits that far exceed their riskadjusted costs of research and development.",2016,Health Care Sciences & Services
"Firm Patenting, Innovations, and Government Institutional Support as a Double-Edged Sword",; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TECHNOLOGY VENTURES; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PRODUCT; PERFORMANCE; CHINA; INDICATORS; BUSINESS; STRATEGY; ORGANIZATIONS,"In 2012, China was ranked fourth in patent filing by region of origin. However, firm innovation quality is not comparable to such quantity. Evidence of this is that no Chinese organization was named as a Thomson Reuters 2011 or 2012 Top 100 Global Innovators. This paradox of firm patenting and innovations in China challenges the traditional understanding of the role of government in industrial innovation. This paper provides a theoretical lens through which to examine traditional protective and strategic patenting motives. Based on institutional theory and the ultimate goals of patenting motives, the paper posits that protective patenting motives are directly law-based while strategic patenting motives are largely law-derived. The paper also aims to empirically examine three questions: (1) What is the relative importance of various patenting motives to firm patenting behaviors? (2) What effects do patenting behaviors have on firm product and process innovations? (3) How, if at all, does governmental institutional support affect firm patenting and innovations? This paper uses dominant analysis, structural equation modeling, and regression analysis to analyze the survey data collected from a sample of 270 firms in China. The empirical results provide new evidence about firm patenting, innovations, and government institutional support. First, the order of relative importance of patenting motives to patenting behaviors was found to be (in the descending order of importance) reputation, exchange, blocking, and protection. Second, patenting behaviors were more relevant to product innovations than to process innovations. Third, more importantly, while government institutional support can enhance the effects of protective patenting motives on patenting behaviors, it can mitigate the effects of strategic patenting motives on patenting behaviors. Moreover, government institutional support reduces the positive effect of patenting behaviors on product innovations. These findings suggest that firm patenting and innovations are distinct activities, and that government institutional support acts as a double-edged sword in firm patenting and innovations: On the one hand government institutional supportan extralegal formal institutionmay work alongside the patent systema law-based formal institutionto advance science and technology, but on the other hand government institutional support may distract firms from commercializing patented knowledge into new products. This paper primarily contributes to institutional theory, new product development literature, and innovation management practice by revealing the dynamics between two different types of formal institutionspatent system and government institutional supportby establishing an institution-based view of patenting motives, by empirically distinguishing firm patenting and innovations, and more interestingly by uncovering a double-edged role of government institutional support in firm patenting and innovations.",2015,Business & Economics; Engineering
Fair and Equitable Treatment and Judicial Patent Decisions,; STANDARDS,"This article focuses on the increased scope for tension between obligations under investment treaties, particularly fair and equitable treatment (FET), and the interpretation of national patent law by domestic courts. Precisely because investment treaties were created to protect investors from State-led mistreatment and bias, and investment treaties include intellectual property (IP) rights in their definition of investment, the question is how much flexibility national courts retain in applying, interpreting, and developing IP laws. The implication of international investment treaties limiting long-standing flexibilities in IP law could be serious and profound. What more precisely are the implications of the international investment law FET standard for patent law and domestic court interpretations? Our main conclusions are: first, that investment tribunals should defer substantially to interpretations of patent law by domestic courts, limiting themselves to reviewing decisions for lack of a rational basis or lack of elementary procedural fairness (denial of justice). They should not engage in closer scrutiny. Second, if investment tribunals engage in closer scrutiny (for instance, in relation to patent decisions by other State organs, or if they reject our first conclusion), FET provides limited stability for existing patents and for patent law. Investors have no legitimate expectation that national patents will be irrevocable, that national courts will interpret domestic rules of patentability-such as utility-in a particular way, or that patent law will be static over time. However, domestic courts (and other State organs) breach FET if they contradict settled patent law and apply this to the existing patents in such a way that the patent rights are diminished, or adopt an interpretation with no rational basis.",2016,Government & Law

In this paper, we investigate the effects of regional and temporal variation in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws on firms' innovative activities. We find that bankruptcy laws that provide stronger debtor protection decrease the number of patents produced by small firms. Stronger debtor protection also decreases the average quality, and variance in quality, of firms' patents. We find evidence that the negative effect of stronger debtor protection on experimentation and innovation may be due to the decreased availability of external financing in response to stronger debtor rights, an effect amplified in industries with a high dependence on external financing. Hence, while it is typically assumed that stronger debtor protection encourages innovation by reducing the cost of failure for innovators, we show that it can instead dampen innovative activities by tightening the availability of external financing to innovative firms.",2017,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
HORIZONTAL INNOVATION AND INTERFACE PATENTS,; HOLDUP,"Scholars understandably devote a great deal of effort to studying how well patent law works to incentivize the most important inventions. After all, these inventions form the foundation of our new technological age. But very little time is spent focusing on the other end of the spectrum, inventions that are no better than what the public already has. At first blush, studying such horizontal innovation seems pointless. But this inquiry actually reveals much about how patents can be used in unintended and arguably anticompetitive ways. This issue has roots in one unintuitive aspect of patent law. Despite the law's goal of promoting innovation, patents can be obtained on inventions that are no better than existing technology. Such patents might appear worthless, but companies regularly obtain these patents to cover interfaces. That is because interface patents actually derive value from two distinct characteristics. First, they can have innovation value that is based on how much better the patented interface is than existing technology. Second, interface patents can also have compatibility value. In other words, the patented technology is often essential to make products operate (i.e., compatible) with a particular interface. In practical terms, this means that an interface patent that covers little or no meaningful advance can give a company the ability to extract rents and foreclose competition. This undesirable result is a consequence of how patent law has structured its remedies. For years, patent law has implicitly awarded both innovation and compatibility values. Recently, the courts have taken a sensible first step and excluded compatibility value from reasonable royalty recoveries for standard essential patents. This Article argues that the law needs to go further and do the same for all essential interface patents. Additionally, patent law should discard the use of injunctions and lost profits in these contexts because both of these remedies inevitably award compatibility value. The sole remedy should be an innovation-value-based reasonable royalty. This proposal has two benefits. First, it would eliminate the incentives for wasteful patents on horizontal technology. Second, and more importantly, the value of all interface patents would be better aligned with the goals of the patent system.",2016,Government & Law

AFTER CHRISTIANSON: FEDERAL JURISDICTION OVER INVENTORSHIP DISPUTES ABOUT PATENT APPLICATIONS,; ,"Federal courts of appeals are split over whether district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over inventorship disputes about patent applications. The Federal Circuit and Fifth and Sixth Circuits agree that the patent statute provides a private right of action for correcting the inventorship of issued patents but not of pending applications. The Federal Circuit and its regional sister courts disagree, however, about whether an inventorship dispute about a patent application satisfies 28 U.S.C. 1338 under Christianson v. Colt Industries and its progeny. The dispute is nontrivial because, unlike a dismissal for failure to state a claim, a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction permits a district court to remand an inventorship dispute to state court. And, because this is a jurisdictional dispute, Federal Circuit precedent is not controlling where it disagrees with its regional sister courts. After examining a case study about inventor ship disputes and patent applications, this Note reviews law on inventorship disputes, the law on arising under jurisdiction, and the circuit split. It then analyzes that split, and, ultimately, it concludes that the Federal Circuit was essentially correct that inventorship disputes about patent applications arise under the patent statute, but should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This Note recommends that the Supreme Court should overrule the Fifth and Sixth Circuits and that courts should replace the evidentiary standard for inventorship disputes about patents-clear-and-convincing evidence with a preponderance standard. Changing the evidentiary standard would comport with the America Invents. Act's revisions to inventorship correction and provide a safety valve for inventorship disputes over patent applications for which a diligent, good faith plaintiff lacks a remedy and must wait until the USPTO issues the patent to obtain relief",2017,Government & Law
Quick Decisions in Patent Cases,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; SUBJECT-MATTER; COURT; RULES; LITIGATION; SETTLEMENT; SELECTION; DOCTRINE; DISPUTES; TROLLS,"Patent litigation is notoriously expensive and time consuming. In the past decade, however, patent law has changed in many ways that expedite resolution of infringement disputes. This Article identifies and evaluates this trend toward quick decisions in patent cases. Balancing the savings in litigation costs against the potential for error, the Article defends many recent and controversial developments, including the Supreme Court's invigoration of the patent eligible subject matter requirement, the new administrative proceedings created by the America Invents Act, and changes in the requirements for pleading patent infringement. These developments permit defendants to obtain rulings of invalidity or noninfringement before discovery begins, which was previously impossible. Prediscovery rulings cost relatively little and can discourage low-merit litigation. But resolving complex questions of validity or infringement on a thin factual record may increase the risk of error, so the Article suggests additional reforms to help ensure that quick decisions are also accurate decisions.",2018,Government & Law
Academic Medical Centers as Innovation Ecosystems: Evolution of Industry Partnership Models Beyond the Bayh-Dole Act,; DISCOVERY; PATENTS; SCIENCE; DRUGS,"Innovation ecosystems tied to academic medical centers (AMCs) are inextricably linked to policy, practices, and infrastructure resulting from the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980. Bayh-Dole smoothed the way to patenting and licensing new drugs and, to some degree, medical devices and diagnostic reagents. Property rights under Bayh-Dole provided significant incentive for industry investments in clinical trials, clinical validation, and industrial scale-up of products that advanced health care. Bayh-Dole amplified private investment in biotechnology drug development and, from the authors' perspective, did not significantly interfere with the ability of AMCs to produce excellent peer-reviewed science. In today's policy environment, it is increasingly difficult to patent and license products based on the laws of natureas the scope of patentability has been narrowed by case law and development of a suitable clinical and business case for the technology is increasingly a gating consideration for licensees. Consequently, fewer academic patents are commercially valuable. The role of technology transfer organizations in engaging industry partners has thus become increasingly complex. The partnering toolbox and organizational mandate for commercialization must evolve toward novel collaborative models that exploit opportunities for future patent creation (early drug discovery), data exchange (precision medicine using big data), cohort assembly (clinical trials), and decision rule validation (clinical trials). These inputs contribute to intellectual property rights, and their clinical exploitation manifests the commercialization of translational science. New collaboration models between AMCs and industry must be established to leverage the assets within AMCs that industry partners deem valuable.",2018,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services

THE UNEASY CASE FOR PATENT FEDERALISM,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; CIRCUIT; JUDICIARY; ECONOMICS; LAW,"Nationwide uniformity is often considered an essential feature of the patent system, necessary to fulfill that system's disclosure and incentive purposes. In the last few years, however, more than half the states have enacted laws that seek to disrupt this uniformity by making it harder for patent holders to enforce their patents. There is an easy case to be made against giving states greater authority over the patent system: doing so would threaten to disrupt the system's balance between innovation incentives and a robust public domain and would permit rent seeking by states that disproportionately produce or consume innovation. There is, nevertheless, an uneasy case that this particular form of patent federalism may be a good thing. The federal patent system has systemic flaws that lead to low-quality patents, nuisance patent litigation, and patent trolls exploiting asymmetric bargaining power. And efforts to address these flaws have faltered, or have had limited effects, due to publicchoice dynamics in the patent system, so the scope of patent protections has expanded over time without regard to the system's purpose of encouraging innovation. States may help address some of these problems not in spite of, but because of, their own flaws. States have their own public-choice dynamics that happen to offset some of the flaws of the federal system. State antipatent laws have been driven largely by small businesses and local smallbusiness groups, which, unlike most patent holders, have preexisting influence in state government. And the laws they have crafted using this influence are well-targeted to affect only the most troublesome patent cases: nuisance cases, cases asserting low-quality patents, and cases targeting end users. States pushing back with anti-patent laws, then, may represent an effective second-best solution to the problem of harmful patent assertions. Moreover, recognizing the dynamics that led to these laws may provide helpful insights in designing federal patent reforms.",2017,Government & Law
THE SUPREME ASSIMILATION OF PATENT LAW,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; EXCEPTIONALISM; SYSTEM,"Although tensions between universality and exceptionalism apply throughout law, they are particularly pronounced in patent law, a field that deals with highly technical subject matter. This Article explores these tensions by investigating an underappreciated descriptive theory of Supreme Court patent jurisprudence. Significantly extending previous scholarship, it argues that the Court's recent decisions reflect a project of eliminating patent exceptionalism and assimilating patent doctrine to general legal principles (or, more precisely, to what the Court frames as general legal principles). Among other motivations, this trend responds to rather exceptional patent doctrine emanating from the Federal Circuit in areas as varied as appellate review of lower courts, remedies, and the award of attorney's fees. The Supreme Court has consistently sought to eliminate patent exceptionalism in these and other areas, bringing patent law in conformity with general legal standards. Among other implications, this development reveals the Supreme Court's holistic outlook as a generalist court concerned with broad legal consistency, concerns which are less pertinent to the quasi-specialized Federal Circuit. Turning to normative considerations, this Article argues in favor of selective, refined exceptionalism for patent law. Although the Supreme Court should strive for broad consistency, certain unique features of patent law particularly the role and expertise of the Federal Circuit justify some departure from general legal norms. Finally, this Article turns to tensions between legal universality and exceptionalism more broadly, articulating principles to guide the deviation of specialized areas of law from transcendent principles.",2016,Government & Law

Thirty years of research has investigated the legislation's effectiveness and derivative university practices, such as the establishment of technology transfer offices. Unfortunately, the technology transfer literature has focused primarily on patenting as the primary transfer vehicle for protecting intellectual property in universities, overlooking other forms of IP ownership, such as copyrights. Legal scholarship shows, however, that universities are increasingly using copyrights to protect their intellectual property and that the number of university-held copyrights exceeds patents. This paper examines the use of copyrights to protect and transfer university IP. It does so by reviewing underlying legal and policy concepts associated with copyrights and offers contemporary examples of copyright issues within universities. The paper therefore provides a foundation for future research on the role of copyrights in technology transfer.",2019,Engineering; Business & Economics

Edge-between clustering and key-route main path analysis are employed to complementarily accomplish the task. This study retrieves patenting related articles covering 1970 to 2013 from Web of Science (WOS) and constructs the citation network among them. The edge-betweenness clustering technique and key-route main path analysis are then applied to identify the major research themes and development trajectories of patenting research. Eight major research themes are identified: 'citation network analysis', 'patent law', 'patent valuation', 'academic patenting', 'gene patenting', 'patent policy', 'patent protection', and 'technology analysis'. The linkage among these eight research themes is exhibited, along with a presentation of the statistics of top influential journals and authors. This study demonstrates that the approach used herein is a powerful way to determine the major research themes and development trajectories of a target academic field. The approach is also applicable to any other data with citation relationships. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2016,Business & Economics; Public Administration
The New World of Agency Adjudication,; ADMINISTRATIVE-PROCEDURE ACT; PATENT; COURTS; RULEMAKING; HEARINGS; CHOICE; POLICY; LAW,"In 1946, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) set forth the criteria for formal adjudication, requiring an administrative law judge to make the initial determination and the agency head to have the final word. That is the lost world. Today, the vast majority of agency adjudications Congress has created are not paradigmatic `formal adjudications as set forth in the APA. It turns out that there is great diversity in the procedures by which federal agencies adjudicate. This new world involves a variety of less-independent administrative judges, hearing officers, and other agency personnel adjudicating disputes. But, like in the lost world, the agency head retains final decision-making authority. In 2011, Congress created yet another novel agency tribunal the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) to adjudicate patent validity disputes between private parties. Questions abound concerning the PTAB's proper place in the modern administrative state, as its features depart from the textbook accounts of APA-governed 'formal adjudication. Many of these questions are working their way through the Federal Circuit and to the Supreme Court. Indeed, the Supreme Court recently held in Oil States Energy Services that PTAB adjudication does not unconstitutionally strip parties of their property rights in issued patents while expressly leaving open many questions concerning the limits of administrative adjudication. This Article situates PTAB adjudication within administrative law's larger landscape of agency adjudication. By surveying this new world of agency adjudication, we find that PTAB adjudication is not extraordinary. But we also identify one core feature of modern agency adjudication that is absent at the PTAB: the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office lacks final decision-making authority. To be sure, the Director has some power to influence outcomes: in the past, she has ordered rehearing of cases and stacked the board with administrative patent judges who share her substantive vision. But these second-best means of agency-head control raise problems of their own, including constitutional questions and inefficiencies in agency performance. This Article concludes by exploring alternative mechanisms that would remedy the lack of agency-head review at the PTAB.",2019,Government & Law
Standing Up for the Dead Inventor: Ensuring a Personal Representative's Standing to Sue for Patent Infringement,; ,"The patent system is the product of federal law, while the probate system is that of state law. As one can imagine, issues arise when these two interact- and, because statutes give patents the attributes of personal property, the two inevitably do. One problem is an apparent void of standing to sue for patent infringement when the patent is part of an estate in probate. By subverting the prior understanding that a personal representative holds title to a patent in the decedent's estate in Akazawa v. Link New Technology International, Inc., the Federal Circuit has established an ambiguity over who can assert infringement. Accordingly, Congress should enact a provision to explicitly ensure that standing passes on to a personal representative; this Note recommends language for such a provision. In the alternative, Congress should amend the patent laws to provide a statutory basis for a personal representative's standing by adding personal representative to 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(1). The resulting statute would then grant the exclusive right in a patent to the patentee, his personal representative, heirs, or assigns. Doing so fulfills the states' presumption that a personal representative already has standing, comports with a personal representative's existing duties over patents as well as his analogous duties over copyrights, and promotes policy cooperation between patent law and succession law. Other possible solutions such as imparting patents with the qualities of contracts are ineffective because they subvert established law, deny the harmony of the patent and probate systems' policy goals, and give rise to problematic incentives.",2018,Government & Law

PATENT LAW'S PHILOSOPHICAL FAULT LINE,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PUNITIVE DAMAGES; ANTICOMMONS; REQUIREMENT; RETHINKING; UTILITY; TROLLS; HOLDUP; LEVERS; RULES,"Under the conventional view, utilitarian theory has come to dominate patent law. Patents are viewed as the incentive we offer for innovation, from which all of society ultimately benefits, despite short-term monopoly costs. Patent doctrines are, in turn, assessed against the goals of optimizing that incentive and reducing those costs. On the other side, a minority of embattled jurists and scholars defend the relevance of freestanding moral principles, such as desert, autonomy, or justice, and argue for their re-incorporation into contemporary patent doctrine and policy. This Article challenges the conventional terms of this debate by offering a unique reframing: a resilient thread of moral principles does remain woven into patent law, but largely only in one half of the tapestry. Whereas utilitarian theories generally do an excellent job of explaining modern patent validity law, many of the core doctrines in patent infringement law are heavily influenced by broad moral principles-and sometimes even hostile to a traditional economic approach. The Article examines in detail the most significant doctrines governing patent validity-novelty, non-obviousness, subject-matter eligibility, utility, written description, enablement, and inventorship-and demonstrates the strength of their relationship to utilitarian frameworks at the (often explicit) expense of others. The Article then explores the most significant doctrines with respect to patent infringement-relief (whether injunctive or damages), scope (vis-a-vis the doctrine of equivalents), and defenses (inequitable conduct and prior use)-and builds the case that reference to non-utilitarian, moral frameworks is often needed to explain their contours. This fault line, the article argues, can likely be traced to three interrelated causes: the adjudicatory split between the USPTO and district courts, the influence of traditional property law, and the mix of private-law and public-law features that patents exhibit. Finally, the article concludes by briefly examining the implications for policymakers, using two case studies of reform efforts: patents on surgical techniques and plants.",2019,Government & Law

BREAKING THE VICIOUS CYCLE OF PATENT DAMAGES,; LIABILITY RULES; PROPERTY; SHADOW; HOLDUP; LAW,"Patent law is implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, based upon a story of patent infringement in which technology users are presumed to be able to discover relevant patents in advance and either design around them or negotiate patent licenses before using the patented technology. That story does not hold true in many fields today, in which the number and widespread ownership of potentially relevant patents renders such preclearance both infeasible as a practical matter and undesirable as a matter of economic policy. But patent damages law continues to apply this outmoded paradigm. As a result, current doctrine perpetuates a vicious cycle of excessive, socially harmful remedies. We propose a number of ways for patent law to adapt to this new reality. First, reasonable royalty remedies should be based on the market value of the patent before infringement and should exclude post-infringement considerations such as lock-in that infect current doctrine and lead to exaggerated damages awards. Second, patent remedy law should distinguish between infringers in the paradigmatic story, who can be regarded as guilty infringers, and innocent infringers for whom preclearance was not practicable; and it should further distinguish between patent holders that were willing to license their patents before infringement and those that had decided to retain exclusive control over their patented invention. In effect, there are four combinations: innocent/willing, innocent/unwilling, guilty/willing, and guilty/unwilling. Remedies should depend on which combination is at issue, and injunctions should be available only for unwilling licensors. In the innocent/unwilling scenario, the patent holder should be able to obtain an injunction only if it agrees to bear the innocent infringer's costs of switching to a noninfringing alternative.",2016,Government & Law
"How to patent a chemical? The instability of a new type of intellectual property (Switzerland, 1888-1907)",patents; history; Switzerland; chemical industry; product patents; process patents; patent scope; ,"The extension of intellectual property, and the pressure exerted on developing countries through trade agreements, is not as recent as is often thought. This article examines such a historical case, when Switzerland revised its patent law in 1907, to extend patent protection to chemicals. This was largely due to the pressure exerted by the German government and to the lobbying of the country's chemical industry. Examining closely the elaboration of the new patent law, the article reveals how unstable the category of patents cm chemical inventions was. It did not simply cross a border, being exported from Germany to Switzerland. As Swiss politicians and industrialists discussed the new patent law, they referred to other countries, but they did not only copy, they also rejected some of their features. The reasons for this instability were not to be found only in the pressure and criticism exerted by Germany, or the willingness to protect the interests of the Swiss chemical industry. The Swiss law also differed because of real and legitimate concerns regarding the effects of patents on society and economy.",2015,Government & Law
IMPROVING PATENT QUALITY THROUGH POST-GRANT CLAIM AMENDMENTS: A COMPARISON OF EUROPEAN OPPOSITION PROCEEDINGS AND US POST-GRANT PROCEEDINGS,; ,"Congress enacted the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act to encourage innovation, strengthen U.S. patents, and achieve greater uniformity with foreign patent systems. The America Invents Act introduced two new post-grant patent validity proceedings: inter partes review and post-grant review. The new U.S. proceedings are similar to European opposition proceedings, but there are significant differences in the extent of the patent owner's ability to amend claims, the patent's claim construction, the patent owner's evidentiary burden, and the procedural requirements. The U.S. proceedings result in a very limited opportunity for amendment and a high percentage of invalidated patents. In contrast, European opposition proceedings are generally more conducive to upholding patents, whether in original or amended form. The current U.S. practice for amending claims in post-grant proceedings should be changed to both achieve balance between claim vitality and extent of opportunity to amend, and to serve the America Invents Act's goals of strengthening patents and encouraging innovation. A full adoption of the European opposition claim amendment practice, particularly the claim construction standard and expansive opportunity for amendment, would fail to balance claim vitality and ease of amendment, favor patent owners, and disserve the goals of the America Invents Act. This Note nevertheless advocates for adoption of certain European characteristics to improve U.S. post-grant proceedings.",2016,Government & Law
Does the Trademark Protection Regulation Protect Consumers against Counterfeit Products? Analyzing the Theories of Trademark and Indonesian Trademark Law,Counterfeit products; Indonesian trademark law; Intellectual property law; ,"Consumer protection against resellers infringing intellectual property (IP) is not guaranteed based on Consumer Protection Act No. 8 of 1999 because it is argued that it is already regulated under IP laws, such as patent, trademark, and copyright laws, prohibiting the production or sale of products infringing IP law. However, because the nature of IP is to protect private rights, how can trademarks protect consumers? This paper analyzes trademark theories and the Trademarks Act No. 20 of 2016 to establish whether trademarks protect consumers. This research concludes that most scholars use utilitarian and economic theories, supporting that trademarks protect consumers by balancing the trademark holder's economic right with the interests of the public as consumers. However, Trademarks Act No. 20 provides very limited protection with only legal, philosophical arguments. Further protection is limited to simply safeguarding consumers from being misled or deceived by stipulation that a potential trademark is distinctive and not registered in bad faith. It neither provides any legal instrument for consumers injured or having suffered any loss nor allows consumers to report counterfeit goods or be reimbursed for loss or injury from buying those goods. Therefore, protecting customers is not the Indonesian trademark law's primary objective.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Although universities helped get the Bayh-Dole Act through Congress, the primary goal, as reflected in the recitals at the beginning of the new statute, was not to benefit universities but to promote the commercial development and utilization of federally funded inventions. In the years since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, universities seem to have lost sight of this distinction. Their behavior as patent seekers, patent enforcers, and patent policy stakeholders often seems to work against the commercialization goals of the Bayh-Dole Act and is difficult to explain or justify on any basis other than the pursuit of revenue.",2018,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics
Impact of artificial intelligence on patent law. Towards a new analytical framework - [ the Multi-Level Model],Patent law; Multi-level model; Patentability; Inventorship; Industry 4.0; 4th industrial revolution; ,"Inventions and new ideas are at the center of societal transformation. Inventions have been historically protected by a system of intellectual property law of which patents are at the heart. Whilst patent law is still deeply moored in its roots in the industrial revolution, to a greater extend it has been able to adapt to the successive revolutions like the computing albeit with some challenges. The world is now at an unprecedented threshold of the most far reaching revolution whose consequences to patent law in particular are so far reaching that its impact is still unknown. This is the AI revolution. This paper begins with an analysis of the AI revolution from available literature and research. It notes that there are divergent views among scholars about the impact of AI on various elements of patent law. It posits that this dissonance might be a result of most scholars treating AI as one homogenous block without distinguishing the various phases in the evolution of AI. It thus proposes a new sui generis conceptual framework - [ the Multi-Level Model] as a suitable basis for insightful conceptual analysis of AI impact on patent law with focus on two key questions; patentability and inventorship.",2019,Information Science & Library Science
The changing function of patents: a reversion to privileges?,; ,"Since its inception, patent law has had many faces, manifesting different aims and functions. The latest recalibrations of the aims and functions of patent law are striking because - at its core - patent law itself has not changed significantly in this time. This paper examines the chameleon-like nature of the function of patents, tracking historical transformations from the privilege as an instrument of trade policy, to patents as an incentive/reward to invent and disclose the invention, and the most recent shift towards viewing patents as necessary for innovation. In particular, the paper addresses whether the latest shift represents a reversion to privilege-like functions, due to the analogous focus on commercialisation, and argues that this is not the case because of the fundamental move to focusing on patentees rather than society as a whole and to seeing patents as property.",2017,Government & Law
A hidden technological assumption in patent law: The case of gene patents and the disclosure requirement,data; gene patents; genetic resources; genomics; patents; TCF7L2; LANDSCAPE; VARIANT; INFORMATION; PROGRESS; HISTORY,"The disclosure requirement in patent law is designed to reveal knowledge regarding a patented invention to allow proper understanding and utilization of that invention. The contention offered here is the presence of an inherent incompatibility between the disclosure requirement and genetic inventions. Genetic inventions are highly contingent on big genetic statistical data (GSD), which is gathered during the commercial phase of a genetic invention. GSD are essential for various purposes, which at least some should be satisfied by the disclosure. However, since GSD can be gathered only at the postapplication period, GSD are not disclosed through the disclosure requirement. Therefore, there is a disclosure-genetics incompatibility. This incompatibility prevents patent law from fully accomplishing its intended purpose. The origins of this incompatibility can be traced to the structure of the disclosure requirement, a consequence of a hidden technological assumption in patent law regarding the very perception of what is an invention. Patent law perceives all inventions as fully revealed objects and not as semirevealed objects. That creates a difficulty that may be more pervasive than for genetics alone. Thus, acknowledging this technological assumption facilitates the introduction of an insight regarding the fully revealed/semirevealed spectrum regarding inventions in other, nongenetic technological fields.",2019,Government & Law
"'Patenting' Karagoz: UNESCO, nationalism and multinational intangible heritage",UNESCO; nationalism; multinational intangible heritage; Greece; Turkey; CULTURAL-HERITAGE; POLITICS,"Borne by people, intangible heritage is not tied to a territory, nor it is necessarily found within the borders of a single country. The 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage recognises this transnational character of intangible heritage and encourages States Parties to submit joint, multinational, nominations to its lists when a cultural element is commonly found in their territory. Despite such encouragement, there have been very few multinational inscriptions on the Convention's lists so far. This article examines nationalistic approaches to intangible heritage as a major obstacle in this situation. While the Convention calls for international cooperation to safeguard the world's intangible heritage, it inadvertently fosters nationalist claims on cultural traditions on the ground. States Parties may treat the Convention as a patent approval system' and use its lists to register shared traditions as their own national heritage. Their listing on behalf of a single State Party generates conflicts among countries over their origin and ownership.

"Statutes, Common Law Rights, and the Mistaken Classification of Patents as Public Rights",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,"Patents are increasingly swept up into the operations of agencies in the modern administrative state. This has raised anew the fundamental question whether patents are private property rights or special privileges (public rights), because this determines how constitutional guarantees apply to patents in administrative proceedings. In Oil States v. Greene's Energy, the Supreme Court held for the first time that patents are public rights that may be canceled by an administrative tribunal solely because patents are creatures of statute. This classification of patents as public rights solely given their statutory provenance is profoundly mistaken. Modern courts and commentators have misconstrued a heuristic used by earlier courts in distinguishing between private rights and public rights. It was only a heuristic because all legal rights share mixed origins in both statutes and judicial decisions, including property rights in land and in inventions. This Essay surveys these well-known sources of property rights in both statutes and judicial decisions, revealing that conflating common law with private property rights is legal myth, not historical fact. As cases proliferate at the intersection of patent law, administrative law, and constitutional law, it is a fundamental error to classify patents as public rights in relegating vested private property rights to administrative processes and decrees.",2019,Government & Law

There is mounting evidence, however, that they can open up the black box of IP as effectively as they have done for the technosciences, enriching their discipline while making significant contributions to legal studies. One approach is to look at the technologies through which patent law construes its object - the invention - in specific settings and periods by examining procedures, classifications, archives, models, repositories, patent specifications (in both their linguistic and pictorial dimensions), and the highly specialized language of patent claims. More ambitiously, we could treat intellectual property as a technology itself. Patent law does not evolve either by merely articulating its doctrine in response to technological developments. The line between what does and does not count as invention may be redrawn with the emergence of new objects and technologies, but is not determined by them. It is this constructive feature of the law that we are trying to capture with the notion of law as technology. We hope that thinking about the technologies of the law and the law as technology will bring into question what we mean by both technology and law.",2019,History & Philosophy of Science

IMPROVING THE PATENT SYSTEM BY ENCOURAGING INTENTIONAL INFRINGEMENT: THE BENEFICIAL USE STANDARD OF PATENTS,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ECONOMICS; LITIGATION; RENEWAL; IMPACT; LAW,"With the growing importance of intellectual property in the global economy, patent infringement has become a dirty phrase for patentees and defendants alike. For plaintiffs, it raises thoughts of the theft of one's just deserts. Yet defendants may think of nuisance-value suits and artificial impediments to the free flow of information. Neither side is happy because the American patent system adopts a blunderbuss approach to granting and protecting inventions. We have a one-size-fits-all solution regulated by an administrative agency, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, incapable ( perhaps intentionally) of reliably screening out low-quality patent applications. The result has been a deluge of patents that have been granted when they should not have been-i.e., patents that remain unlitigated, impose high costs, and chill follow-on innovation. But because all patents are treated alike, good patents and bad patents are equal under the law; the patent right is always of equal strength. In this Comment, I argue that patent infringement is something to be embraced, not avoided. Much as the legal academy and practitioners have adopted the counterintuitive idea of the efficient breach of contracts, I note that there is such a thing as the efficient infringement of patents; we should be encouraging infringement in certain circumstances to address to the vast private and social costs in today's patenting system. In this Comment, I analyze the economic and philosophical underpinnings of patent rights, and also make comparisons to trademark law and water law-another area of law that assigns rights under conditions of scarcity. Through this analysis, I demonstrate that sometimes incentivizing patent infringement by varying the strength of the patent right is preferable to the status quo. There is no reason for us to have a one-size-fits-all patent right when granted patents are often of low quality and there is room to fit the strength of the right to the underlying value of the patent. Simply put, I show that a  beneficial use standard for patents, one that identifies whether the patent owner is exploiting the granted patent right in a societally beneficial manner, is more efficient and makes for better policy than our current system.",2017,Government & Law

WHY PATENT EXHAUSTION SHOULD LIBERATE PRODUCTS (AND NOT JUST PEOPLE),; PROPERTY; ANTICOMMONS; LAW,"Patent exhaustion is a doctrine that excuses infringement where the patent holder has either authorized the sale of a patented item or licensed its use or sale. Absent an effective contractual restriction, the patent holder's rights in the patented item are exhausted and the patent holder cannot sue for infringement based on further use or resale of the item. This Article explores the question of whether patent exhaustion adheres in the patented device or if it is a defensive doctrine that only adheres to the benefit of particular parties. Traditionally courts have articulated the doctrine as liberating the accused product from patent rights, allowing it to pass through the stream of commerce to subsequent users with all rights exhausted. With respect to actual holdings, however, the Federal Circuit recently concluded that exhaustion has only excused infringement in the case law where the claim of infringement was against an authorized acquirer of the device, or against a party accused of inducing or contributing to the infringement of such an authorized acquirer. Apparently a third party can be liable for infringement by unwittingly taking action that facilitates the end user's use of the device for its intended purpose, even if the device is licensed to perform that function. This Article argues that the exhaustion doctrine should not be limited to shielding authorized acquirers of a patented device or any other particular classes of persons. The Supreme Court has never pronounced such a limitation on the doctrine. Rather, the Court has consistently characterized exhaustion as adhering in the patented device itself, allowing it to pass unimpeded through the stream of commerce to be used for its intended purpose. A conception of patent exhaustion as adhering in the patented device is supported by all of the policy theories that have been used to justify the doctrine. The exhaustion doctrine has traditionally been justified by (1) a policy to retain the balance between the need to encourage invention and the harm of a limited monopoly by ensuring that the inventor does not receive double recovery for the value of the patented invention and (2) the policy against restraints on alienation of servitudes. Recently scholars have argued that the patent exhaustion doctrine serves a third purpose: to guard the domain of the federal patent law, such that it does not interfere with the general commercial law of contracts. In fact, the Supreme Court has long embraced all three theories as supporting patent exhaustion. Moreover, all three theories support a concept of patent exhaustion adhering in the patented device. If the purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to police the domain of intellectual property statutes, such that they do not interfere with commercial law, then the ability of patent holders to police the use of downstream goods is properly limited by contract law rules such as privity of contract and unconscionability. Patent rights must be exhausted to avoid interference with those laws. If the exhaustion doctrine is justified by the related statutory domain policy against overcompensation for patent holders for the use of their patented inventions, then third parties should not be charged for interacting with patented devices for which the patent holders have already received market-based compensation. If the exhaustion doctrine is justified by the common law policy against restraints on alienation of chattels, then exhaustion adheres in the patented goods, such that they may move down the stream of commerce unimpeded with restrictions on their lawful and intended uses.",2016,Government & Law

The First Patent Litigation Explosion,; ,"The twenty-first century patent litigation explosion is not unprecedented. In fact, the nineteenth century saw an even bigger surge of patent cases. During that era, the most prolific patent enforcers brought hundreds or even thousands of suits, dwarfing the efforts of today's leading trolls. In 1850, New York City and Philadelphia alone had ten times more patent litigation, per U.S. patent in force, than the entire United States in 2013. Even the absolute quantity of Iate-nineteenth-century patent cases bears comparison to the numbers filed in recent years: the Southern District of New York in 1880 would have ranked third on the list of districts with the most patent infringement suits filed in 2014 and would have headed the list as recently as 2010. This Article reveals the forgotten history of the first patent litigation explosion. It first describes the rise of large-scale patent enforcement in the middle of the nineteenth century. It then draws on new data from the archives of two leading federal courts to trace the development of patent litigation from 1840 to 1910 and to outline the scale, composition, and leading causes of the litigation boom. Finally, the Article explores the consequences of this phenomenon for the law and politics of the patent system. The effects of the litigation explosion were profound. The rise of large-scale patent assertion provides a new explanation for patent law's crucial shift from common law to equity decision making in the middle of the nineteenth century. And at its height, the litigation explosion produced a political backlash that threatened to sweep away the patent system as we know it. Recovering the history of patent law during this formative and turbulent era offers fresh perspectives on the patent reform debates of today.",2016,Government & Law

Patent ambush or patent thickets may be obstacles to more connectivity in sectors such as automated driving. Yet, the Court of Justice raised the bar for intervention in the Huawei case on compulsory licenses as a defence against patent violation claims. The European Commission, in its quest to enable the Internet of Things, has therefore turned away from enforcement of the abuse of dominance provisions in patent cases by proposing other tools in its 2017 communication on standard essential patents. The proposals - more transparency for licensing, more open source - may be read as preparation for regulation. The proposals have deficits, too. To remedy the problem, the Commission most probably will introduce sectoral regulation. It may be more fruitful to pursue a competition-oriented path by: (a) a competition-law control of IoT platforms, (b) an innovation-oriented merger policy as started with Dow/Dupont, and (c) the use of interim measures in the specific IoT context according to Art. 8 of Regulation 1/2003 with presumptions of dominance and abuse.",2019,Government & Law
THE EXCEPTIONALISM NORM IN ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION,; STATUTORY INTERPRETATION; COMMON-LAW; PATENT; RULEMAKING; CHEVRON; DEFERENCE; POWER; ACT; OSSIFICATION; DELEGATION,"The standard narrative envisions administrative law as a quasi-constitutional field with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as its superstatute backbone. In rulemaking and judicial review, this narrative is compelling and has facilitated judicial and scholarly rejection of agency claims to exceptionalism, i.e., exception from uniform, cross-cutting administrative law principles. This Article argues that there is a significant omission from the standard narrative: adjudication. Here, Congress, the courts, agencies, and scholars have embraced the use of unique institutional structures and procedural rules tailored to suit the needs of individual agencies and regulatory programs. As a consequence, most adjudication is conducted outside of the APA, which has little role in defining adjudication or specifying its minimum procedures. In adjudication, this Article argues, exceptionalism is the norm. On the level of theory, this undermines administrative law's standard narrative. More practically, although exceptionalism may benefit individual programs, it threatens system-wide harms-to transparency, fairness, and quality procedural design-that escape program-specific evaluation.",2019,Government & Law

PATENT LAW AND THE EMIGRATION OF INNOVATION,; PROTECTION; PROPERTY; REACH,"Legislators and industry leaders claim that patent strength in the United States has declined, causing firms to innovate in foreign countries. Because, however, patent law is bound by strict territorial limitations, one cannot strengthen patent protection by innovating abroad; as a result, scholarship has largely dismissed the theory that foreign patents have any effect on where firms invent. In essence, then, there is a debate pitting industry leaders against scholarship about whether firms can use offshore innovation to secure stronger patent rights, influencing the rate of innovation. To resolve this puzzle, we offer a novel theory of patent rights which we empirically test-to dispel the positions taken by both scholarship and industry leaders. Given that technology is generally developed in one country, the innovation process exposes the typical inventor to infringement claims only in that jurisdiction. In turn, we demonstrate that inventors have powerful, counterintuitive incentives to develop technology where patent rights are weaker and enforcement is cheaper. Specifically, it typically costs more to defend a patent infringement claim in the United States than to lose one in another country (the cost to litigate a patent in the United States averages about $3.5 million and royalty awards have surpassed $2.5 billion). Our findings suggest that industry advocates and patent scholars overestimate how much innovation strong patent protection generates while underestimating the deterrent effect of these high costs of patent enforcement. This empirical research contributes to the theoretical understanding of patent rights by shedding new light on this important, yet largely dismissed, dimension of where innovation takes place. We received invaluable support from international research organizations and patent attorneys working for top-tier law firms. Notably, the Global IP Project, a multinational research group spearheaded by Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP, the leading global intellectual property law firm, and Darts-ip, an international organization dedicated to the study of global IP litigation, provided proprietary data. This enabled us to explore whether firms optimize value by placing research and innovation in countries with better patent laws. To verify our models, we interviewed notable patent attorneys practicing in the United States, Europe, and Asia.",2019,Government & Law

While previous studies have usually considered patents and trade secrets as substitutes for one another, we investigate to what extent and in what situations the two protection methods are used jointly. We identify protection strategies for single innovation firms and hence overcome the assignment problem of existing empirical studies, that is, whether firms using both protection methods do so for the same innovation or for different innovations. Employing firm panel data from Germany, we find fairly few differences between the determinants for choosing secrecy and patenting. Single innovators that combine both strategies, 39% of the group, tend to aim at a higher level of innovation and act in a more uncertain technological environment. Firms combining both protection methods yield significantly higher sales with new-to-market innovations, providing some evidence for a complementarity of the two protection methods.",2019,Business & Economics
THE UNEASY CASE FOR PATENT LAW,; FECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION; CLOSTRIDIUM-DIFFICILE INFECTION; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NORMS; INNOVATION; BURDEN; INCREASE; IMPACT; DRUGS; FIRMS,"A central tenet of patent law scholarship holds that if any scientific field truly needs patents to stimulate progress, it is pharmaceuticals. Patents are thought to be critical in encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize new therapies, due to the high costs of researching diseases, developing treatments, and bringing drugs through the complex, expensive approval process. Scholars and policymakers often point to patent law's apparent success in the pharmaceutical industry to justify broader calls for more expansive patent rights. This Article challenges this conventional wisdom about the centrality of patents to drug development by presenting a case study of the role of patents in the emerging field of microbiome research. Scientists have recently begun to appreciate the important role played by the human microbiome, the community of microbes that lives within each of our bodies, in preventing and treating disease. The microbiome has been linked to autoimmune disorders, mental health conditions, and a range of conditions affecting our intestinal systems. Put simply, research involving the microbiome has the potential to change the future of medicine. There's just one problem: the microbiome can't meaningfully be patented. Several doctrines within patent law will make it extremely difficult for companies to obtain and enforce patents like the ones that are so readily available in most areas of medicine. Drawing on patent doctrine, patent searches, and interviews with scientists and lawyers, this Article demonstrates that companies are developing microbiome-based therapies largely in the absence of patent protection. Instead, the companies are relying on other innovation incentives to fill the gap. The microbiome's unpatentability presents an opportunity to evaluate whether patents are truly necessary for the development of new drugs. Congress, the NIH, and the FDA have implemented many innovation incentives throughout the development process, and we should not be astonished that removing a single such incentive, patent law, does not disrupt the entire system. Perhaps scholars should reconsider, if only selectively, our focus on patents as an irreplaceable driver of pharmaceutical innovation.",2018,Government & Law

Post-AIPA, firms have an incentive to apply for patents only if commercial success is likely. Accordingly, we expect post-AIPA patents to be a better proxy for successful innovation activity, and thus to have a stronger effect on reducing the cost of debt than pre-AIPA patents. Indeed, we find that pre-AIPA patents reduce the cost of debt only for the most innovative firms, while post-AIPA, this effect holds for all firms.",2019,Business & Economics
The E-commerce Law of the People's Republic of China: E-commerce platform operators liability for third-party patent infringement,E-commerce platform; Patent; Liability; E-commerce law; China; Notice and takedown; ,"The E-Commerce Law of the People's Republic of China(E-commerce Law) was enacted on August 31, 2018. One of the hottest topics is e-commerce platform operators (EPOs) liability for third-party patent infringement. The EPOs, which provide platform services rather than participating in trade directly, must try to maintain the balance between patentees and social interests. Due to the particularities of the patent infringement review, it is difficult for the EPOs to fulfil the task. Thus, the EPOs liability for copyright and trademark infringement is likely unworkable in the patent area. A China practice review will be helpful in analysing the problem; the guiding case No. 83 is an especially meaningful reference. The E-Commerce Law is principled and advisory - it is impossible to distinguish the limits of EPOs liability for third-party patent infringement by differentiating the patent from other intellectual property rights. After reviewing the regulations on the general and intellectual property duty of care of EPOs, this article argues that the E-Commerce Law still has some specific problems. Consequently, to implement the E-Commerce Law, judicial interpretation and detailed rules for implementation should be formulated as soon as possible, and the potential solutions are described in the conclusion.

That is, they apply equally to patents that have already been granted and patents that do not yet exist. There are benefits to making a change in the law retroactive, particularly if the new legal rule is an improvement over what preceded it. But there are costs as well. Retroactive changes in the law upset reliance interests. This can be particularly harmful when those reliance interests involve rights or entitlements that form the basis for substantial financial investment, as is often the case with patents. What is more, judges are aware that their decisions can do violence to existing reliance interests. This makes judges wary of making changes to patent law in the first place, which can lead to the law becoming stultified. Reducing the rate of legal change is not an adequate solution. Neither is takings law, which is commonly applied to solve similar problems that arise in the context of real property but is a poor fit for intellectual property. Rather, to ameliorate the reliance concerns generated by legal change, federal judges should be afforded the latitude to make their rulings purely prospective. And patent judges should exercise this discretion in the many cases where forward-looking change is called for but backward-looking change would do more harm than good.",2019,Government & Law
How Drug Life-Cycle Management Patent Strategies May Impact Formulary Management,; ,"Drug manufacturers may employ various life-cycle management patent strategies, which may impact managed care decision making regarding formulary planning and management strategies when single-source, branded oral pharmaceutical products move to generic status. Passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act enabled more rapid access to generic medications through the abbreviated new drug application process. Patent expirations of small-molecule medications and approvals of generic versions have led to substantial cost savings for health plans, government programs, insurers, pharmacy benefits managers, and their customers. However, considering that the cost of developing a single medication is estimated at $2.6 billion (2013 dollars), pharmaceutical patent protection enables companies to recoup investments, creating an incentive for innovation. Under current law, patent protection holds for 20 years from time of patent filing, although much of this time is spent in product development and regulatory review, leaving an effective remaining patent life of 7 to 10 years at the time of approval. To extend the product life cycle, drug manufacturers may develop variations of originator products and file for patents on isomers, metabolites, prodrugs, new drug formulations (eg, extended-release versions), and fixed-dose combinations. These additional patents and the complexities surrounding the timing of generic availability create challenges for managed care stakeholders attempting to gauge when generics may enter the market. An understanding of pharmaceutical patents and how intellectual property protection may be extended would benefit managed care stakeholders and help inform decisions regarding benefit management.",2016,Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine
An Exploration of Taiwan's Legal System in Regard to Patent Dispute Resolution under the Globalization Trend,National Law; Transnational Law; Patent Disputes; Equitable Arbitration; Judge-Made Law; ,"With the development of the globalization trends, the value of a multi-cultural society is threatened by the mainstream view of globalization; thus, the sovereignty of national laws is also facing the challenges of transnational law. Unfortunately, under the impact of globalization trends, the legal systems are unable to keep up with the speed of industrial changes. Obviously, Taiwanese legal system is facing rapid changes in the high-tech industries, and providing effective legal remedies for patent disputes have become an important subject for transnational law. Actually, the patent dispute cases often involve industrial and legal considerations in Taiwan's high-tech industry, such as professional technology, short product life, time to market, uncertain patent claims, court judgments at different trial levels, and the conflicts between national and transnational laws. Accordingly, in order to connect with transnational law and enrich Taiwan's judicial culture, this article takes Taiwan, the US, EU, and China as examples to explore and analyze the national legal provisions with regard to experts' participation in trial proceedings, the jurisdiction of courts and the consistency of verdicts, the recognition of equitable arbitration, and judge- made law.",2019,Government & Law
May your drug price be evergreen,Drugs; Pricing; Patents; Evergreening; Pharmaceuticals; ANTITRUST ANALYSIS; ORPHAN; PATENTS; POLICY; LAW; INCENTIVES; PROPERTY; LIFE; ACT; US,"Presenting the first comprehensive study of evergreening, this article examines the extent to which evergreening behavior-which can be defined as artificially extending the protection cliff-may contribute to the problem. The author analyses all drugs on the market between 2005 and 2015, combing through 60,000 data points to examine every instance in which a company added a new patent or exclusivity. The results show a startling departure from the classic conceptualization of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals. Rather than creating new medicines, pharmaceutical companies are largely recycling and repurposing old ones. Specifically, 78% of the drugs associated with new patents were not new drugs, but existing ones, and extending protection is particularly pronounced among blockbuster drugs. Once companies start down the road of extending protection, they show a tendency to return to the well, with the majority adding more than one extension and 50% becoming serial offenders. The problem is growing across time.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine
The EPO as patent law-maker in Europe,; UNITARY PATENT; TRANSITION; PROPERTY; SYSTEM,"This article examines the role of the European Patent Organisation (EPO) in the European patent system. It shows how the delineation of European patent law has been handed over by governments to an autonomous, quasi-judicial technocracy at the EPO and reveals how the process of hollowing out economic and political factors in the grant of patents is assisted by the deference of national courts to the EPO and the creation of the Unified Patent Court. It suggests that these developments pose a threat to democratic governance of the patent system in Europe because the delineation of intellectual property rights has inherent economic and political dimensions which are not reducible to technical legal issues of interpretation or technocratic expertise.",2019,Government & Law
Eli Lilly v Canada: the uncomfortable liaison between intellectual property and international investment law,patent revocation; intellectual property rights; NAFTA; PCT; investment law; expropriation; FET; utility; ARBITRATION; AGREEMENTS; MEDICINES; ACCESS; RIGHTS,"In 2012, Eli Lilly, a US pharmaceutical corporation, initiated an investor-state arbitral claim against the Canadian government after the Canadian courts invalidated two of Eli Lilly's Canadian patents, claiming that the application of the so-called 'promise doctrine' violates international patent law agreements. Even though this is not the first investment arbitration case in which intellectual property rights have played such a substantial role, Eli Lilly's claim against Canada illustrates an innovative attempt to employ an international investment agreement to protect IPRs, with a private actor seeking to claim compensation for the invalidation of its patents. Furthermore, it has created significant controversy over the inclusion and recognition of intellectual property rights as 'investments' within the scope of international investment agreements. Therefore, in this article, we examine the initial granting and revocation of Eli Lilly's patents in more detail, and discuss the critical problems arising from the possibility of private investors directly challenging domestic patent laws' compliance with international patent agreements before international arbitral tribunals.",2017,Government & Law

Revisiting the Principle of Technological Neutrality in Patent Protection in the Age of 3D Printing Technology and Cloud Computing,; ,"Contemporary patent laws based on the norms of the WTO-TRIPS Agreement seem to be driven toward technological neutrality and universal applicability. In most countries, a technologically neutral standard of patentability applies in a non-discriminating manner, regardless of the field of technology, and regardless of the identity of the inventor and the place of the invention. Neutrality in the substantive aspects of patent laws, among others, now extends to the subject matter neutrality-that the availability of patent protection is not tied to the technological field and neutrality in the enjoyment of the right. In contrast to this neutral outlook of contemporary patent law, subjective policy aspects of patent law have long been part of patent law making. For society, the need for an economic and innovation policy not to subject to a certain field of industry to patenting still exists. As a matter of practice, the need to differentiate various technological fields so as to determine exact parameters for substantive patent examination continues to exist. New emerging technologies such as cloud computing and 3D printing are good examples. This paper reviews the notion of technological neutrality in patent protection and its meaning in the age of 3D printing and cloud computing. Both of these technologies are further instances of computer programming technology in which the industry is currently defining its own field of activity, and where the copying of the expression may lead to the exploitation of ideas, literally. Using these two new technologies as examples of subject matters where not only the standard of patent eligibility but also exploitation is questioned, this paper will examine the exact parameters of technological specificity set down in the TRIPS principle of neutrality of patent protection and explore to what extent and manner the future international patent norm should consider the principle of neutrality.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Enforcement of essential patents and industry standards: more economic or innovative approach?,patent; property rights; anti-trust law; anti-competitive practice; FTC; PROPERTY; ANTICOMMONS,"This paper analyzes the interface between industry standards and enforcement of patent rights. When a patent is incorporated into a standard, the patent holder has economic power to exclude its competitors from the markets and increase prices of products and services deliberately. Under this circumstance, competition laws provide effective remedy against the anti-competitive practice. Nevertheless, this paper asserts that an innovative perspective and the incentive to innovate might need to be taken into consideration.",2015,Business & Economics

Supporters counter that patents promote commercialization, but it is doubtful that this benefit can justify the Act's present scope. One important feature of Bayh-Dole, however, has been overlooked in this debate-a feature that arises from the global-public-good nature of knowledge. Without patents on US taxpayer-funded inventions, theUnited States would have no practical way of internalizing the positive externalities these inventions confer on consumers in other countries. Put differently, the charge that Bayh-Dole forces US consumers to 'pay twice' misses the point that eliminating some Bayh-Dole patents would permit non-U. S. consumers to avoid paying at all. To be sure, this 'internalization theory' was not the rationale upon which sponsors of the Act relied. And like commercialization theory, it cannot justify the Act's present scope. Rather than relying on internalization theory to defend Bayh-Dole, we highlight ways in which this novel theory can inform Bayh-Dole debates.",2017,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine
Gene-related inventions in Europe: purpose- vs function-bound protection,patent law; gene patents; purpose-bound; function-bound; Biotech Directive; EPO; Germany; Switzerland; ,"Biotech inventions have proved to be severely challenging for patent law systems around the world. European states have attempted to meet these challenges, resulting in law that directly deals with biotechnology at the national and European level. However, whether different states have dealt with biotechnology in a logical and clear manner is another question. This article discusses law that has been created through the European Union and European Patent Office, before addressing and comparing the manner in which Germany and Switzerland have implemented this law into their national statutes. It concludes that neither state has technologically sound law, creating distinctions that are not practically logical. The final part of this article discusses a term that was introduced into European patent law through the 'Biotech Directive', through the requirement that applicants disclose an industrial application or 'function' for a sequence or partial sequence of a gene. The term 'function' has been taken up by both Germany and Switzerland, but its potential - particularly in contrast to the term 'industrial application' - has yet to be realized. Though one often speaks of purpose-bound claims, this article explores the possibility of function-bound claims.",2015,Government & Law
Intellectual Property Law Solutions to Tax Avoidance,; PATENT; ECONOMICS; INNOVATION; COPYRIGHT; MISUSE; INCOME,"Multinational corporations use intellectual property (IP) to avoid taxes on a massive scale, by transferring their IP to tax havens for artificially low prices. Economists estimate that this abuse costs the U.S. Treasury as much as $90 billion each year. Yet tax policymakers and scholars have been unable to devise feasible tax-law solutions to this problem. This Article introduces an entirely new solution: change IP law rather than tax law. Multinationals' tax-avoidance strategics rely on undervaluing their IP. This Article proposes extending existing IP law so that these low valuations make it harder for multinationals to subsequently litigate or to license their IP. For example, transferring a patent for a low price to a tax-haven subsidiary should make it harder for the multinational to demonstrate the patent's validity, a competitor's infringement, or entitlement to any injunctions. The low transfer price should also weigh toward lower patent damages and potentially even a finding of patent misuse. Extending IP law in such ways would thus deter multinationals from using IP to avoid taxes. Both case law and IP's policy justifications support this approach.",2015,Government & Law
Exhausting Patents,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; EQUITABLE SERVITUDES; ANTITRUST; MARKET; LAW,"A bedrock principle of patent law patent exhaustion proclaims that an authorized sale of a patented article exhausts the patentee's rights with respect to the article sold. Over one hundred and fifty years of case law, however, has produced two conflicting notions of patent exhaustion, one considering exhaustion to be mandatory regardless of whether the patentee subjects the sale to express patent restrictions, and another treating exhaustion as a default rule that applies only in unconditional sales. The uncertainty surrounding the patent exhaustion doctrine casts a significant legal cloud over patent licensing practices in the modern economy and has emerged as a central subject in scholarly debate on the nature and scope of intellectual property rights. This Article takes a normative approach to patent exhaustion and argues that the correct exhaustion rule should be a default-plus rule that combines a default-rule component with a patent misuse test that is independent of the exhaustion analysis. The default-rule component would allow patentees to avoid exhaustion through express patent restrictions, while the patent misuse test would ensure that such restrictions do not violate public policy. This Article contends that this default-plus rule is superior to the mandatory rule in terms of theoretical foundation, malleability, and circumvention. Adopting this default-plus rule would minimize legal impediments to socially beneficial patent restrictions while preserving maximum flexibility in accommodating new technologies and licensing practices.",2016,Government & Law

Design/methodology/approach - Following a generalized method of moments methodology, use is made of a new longitudinal index measuring the strength of enforcement-related aspects of patent systems. Findings - Stronger levels of patent enforcement have a significant positive effect on the economic growth of both developed and developing countries. Importantly, inward FDI flows have a mediating role in positively boosting this effect for all countries and particularly for developed countries. Originality/value - This is the first empirical study of the role of the strength of patent enforcement (law in action) in stimulating economic growth, as previous empirical studies have focused on the effect of the strength of patent law protection (law on the books). The failure in the past to allow for law in action was mainly due to the lack of available data that could proxy for the strength of patent enforcement levels in a country. This study utilizes a newly published, longitudinal index that captures the strength of the enforcement-related aspects of patent systems.",2016,Business & Economics
FUNCTIONALITY SCREENS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; TRADE DRESS; COPYRIGHT; PATENT; PROTECTION; CREATIVITY; COSTS; INNOVATION; SYSTEMS; NORMS,"Among intellectual property (IP) doctrines, only utility patents should protect function. Utility patents offer strong rights that place constraints on competition, but they only arise when inventors can demonstrate substantial novelty after a costly examination. Copyrights, trademarks, and design patents are much easier to obtain than utility patents, and they often last much longer. Accordingly, to prevent claimants from obtaining backdoor patents, the other IP doctrines must screen out functionality. As yet, however, courts and scholars have paid little systematic attention to the ways in which these functionality screens operate across and within IP law. We have four tasks in this Article. First, we identify three separate functionality screens that IP laws use: Filtering, Exclusion, and Threshold. Second, we illustrate the use of these different screens in copyright, trademark, and design patent laws. Each law takes a different approach to screening functionality. Third, we model the relative costs and benefits of the different screening regimes, paying particular attention to administrative and error costs and how these costs affect incentives and competition. Finally, we assess the current screening regimes and offer suggestions for how they might be improved.",2017,Government & Law
"The Challenges, Opportunities and Performance of the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry Post-TRIPS",TRIPS Agreement; Indian Patents Act of 1970; Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers; Patents; R&D; ,"India's generic pharmaceutical producers face numerous challenges after the country's patent law was amended to make it compatible with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Two amendments were significant: introduction of product patent regime covering the area of pharmaceuticals, replacing the process patent regime existing earlier, and increase in patent term for pharmaceutical patents to 20 years, from the earlier 5-7 years (5 years from sealing of patent or 7 years from the date of application, whichever was lower). India's pre-TRIPS patent regime that did not allow product patents in the pharmaceutical sector provided the impetus for the emergence of a generic pharmaceutical industry from the 1980s. How did the Indian pharmaceutical industry respond to the challenges posed by the TRIPS-consistent patent regime, in particular the product patent regime? This paper analysed a number of functional parameters to answer this question. Analysis of the parameters explaining the size and the operational strengths of the major companies in the industry did not suggest structural weaknesses in the generic companies. They continued to remain the leaders in the industry, both in terms of invested capital and size of operations. They remained viable: their profit rates were higher than those in most major manufacturing sectors in India. Although the major generic companies are all producers of generic medicines, they continued to invest sizeable shares of their sales turnover in research and development (R&D). They have been active in taking patents, but their filings in foreign jurisdictions were significantly higher.",2019,Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law
THE END USER'S PREDICAMENT: USER STANDING IN PATENT LITIGATION,; DECLARATORY JUDGMENT; INJURY; COSTS; LAW,"The traditional parties in patent litigation are technologically savvy competitors. Yet recently, patent owners have begun hauling end users including farmers, small cafes, and podcasters-into patent disputes. This Article shows that end users-, unlike competitors, cannot take proactive measures to protect their interests in defending against patent enforcement. The standing doctrine impedes end users' access to federal court to challenge a patent's validity in a declaratory judgment action. At the same time, standing and timing requirements prevent end users from taking advantage of the new procedures created under the America Invents Act to challenge patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). This Article argues that although standing requirements impose a significant obstacle for competitors as well as end users, the unique characteristics of end users place them in a particular predicament. First, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit requires that plaintiffs filing a declaratory judgment suit show that they undertook meaningful preparations to use the patented technology. Yet since users use but do not make technology, they often do not engage in complex preparations. Second, the Federal Circuit requires plaintiffs to point to enforcement acts by the patentee, known as the reasonable apprehension test. Users, however, are usually part of a large group, and those users who have been sued or threatened with suit are not necessarily the ones with the motivation and resources to file declaratory judgment suits. Third, patent enforcement against other similarly situated parties is more likely to chill a user's engagement with a patented technology than a competitor's engagement because users usually lack the technological sophistication to assess the validity of a patent threat. Fourth, the standing doctrine does not protect users because it assumes competitors will defend them. Yet the involuntary appearance of thousands of users on the defense side of patent litigation underscores the fallacy of this assumption. Fifth, end users typically enter patent conflicts late in the life of the patent. By that point, most procedures at the PTO-the forum to challenge patents outside federal court-are unavailable to them. This Article concludes that although end users' current standing status is unclear, end users should qualify for standing under the Federal Circuit's currently diluted reasonable apprehension test. This Article also concludes that end users can satisfy the meaningful preparations test because they do not need complex preparations, which fulfills the immediacy criteria of the test.",2016,Government & Law
TROLLS AND ORPHANS,; INDEPENDENT INVENTION; PATENT HOLDUP; PROPERTY; DEFENSE; VIEW,"Patent trolls and orphan works are major topics of discussion in patent and copyright law, respectively, yet they are rarely discussed together. Commentators seem to regard these two problems in modern IP law as discrete issues with little to do with each other. In reality, patent trolls and orphan works are two sides of the same coin. The patent troll problem occurs when users of a technology are surprised by the emergence of a previously undiscovered patent holder, who holds up the user for the value of fixed investments made in the patented technology. The orphan works problem occurs when potential users of a work fear the later emergence of an undiscovered copyright holder, and therefore refrain from using the work. In both cases the problem is that an undiscovered IP owner may emerge to hold up a user who has made irreversible fixed investments. Understanding the common roots of orphan works and patent trolls has a theoretical payoff in showing how economic theory applies in similar ways across distinct branches of IP law and explains why proposed solutions for patent trolls and orphan works have often unwittingly converged despite the lack of interaction between the two literatures. More practically, understanding patent trolls and orphan works as manifestations of a holdup problem suggests that the literature would benefit from devoting more attention to solving the holdup problem in IP law, while devoting less attention to other issues that have thus far dominated the troll and orphan debates.",2016,Government & Law
Patent Law and the Emerging Science of Synthetic Biology: An Examination of Principle and Practice,synthetic biology; patent; gene patent; biotechnology; Myriad; Venter; PARTS; STANDARDIZATION; PROPERTY,"This article considers how the longstanding debate about patent law and biotechnology is playing out in the emerging field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology draws on molecular biotechnology, chemical engineering, genomics, and information technology to create new tools and techniques with the potential to yield transformative applications in energy, medicine, and many other areas. There has been concern that very broad patents in synthetic biology could impede the development of innovative products and public access to them, thwarting the policy goals of the patent system. Some synthetic biologists are seeking patents, while others are sharing their work in order to avoid the pitfalls of the patent system. The article investigates whether synthetic biology raises new intellectual property issues, and whether law reform or new policies are required. It analyzes the likely impact of key United States case law, such as the Myriad decision on the patentability of synthetic biology technologies. The article argues that the major processes and tools in synthetic biology are likely to meet the legal tests for patentable subject matter. It then presents a detailed case study of the examination practices of the United States Patent and Trademark Office in relation to patent families filed by scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute. The case study shows the patent system to be working well to narrow the scope of broad claims and avoid granting patents for technology too early in its development. The article further argues that there are significant differences between synthetic biology and earlier controversial subject matter, such as human genes and genetic tests. It concludes that while synthetic biology patents do pose possible risks to the goals of the patent system, they are likely to be less problematic in this regard than patents on earlier genetic technologies.",2017,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

PATENT LAW'S REPRODUCIBILITY PARADOX,; CANCER; LIFE,"Clinical research faces a reproducibility crisis. Many recent clinical and preclinical studies appear to be irreproducible - their results cannot be verified by outside researchers. This is problematic for not only scientific reasons but also legal ones: patents grounded in irreproducible research appear to fail their constitutional bargain of property rights in exchange for working disclosures of inventions. The culprit is likely patent law's doctrine of enablement. Although the doctrine requires patents to enable others to make and use their claimed inventions, current difficulties in applying the doctrine hamper or even actively dissuade reproducible data in patents. This Article assesses the difficulties in reconciling these basic goals of scientific research and patent law. More concretely, it provides several examples of irreproducibility in patents on blockbuster drugs - Prempro, Xigris, Plavix, and Avastin - and discusses some of the social costs of the misalignment between good clinical practice and patent doctrine. Ultimately, this analysis illuminates several current debates concerning innovation policy. It strongly suggests that a proper conception of enablement should take into account after-arising evidence. It also sheds light on the true purpose and limits of patent disclosure. And lastly, it untangles the doctrines of enablement and utility.",2017,Government & Law
FORCING PATENT CLAIMS,; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; INFORMATION; LAW; CONSTRUCTION; INVENTION; DOCTRINE; REALITY; SCOPE; ACT,"An enormous literature has criticized patent claims for being ambiguous. In this Article, I explain that this literature misunderstands the real problem: the fundamental concern is not that patent claims are ambiguous but that they are drafted by patentees with self-serving incentives to write claims in an overbroad manner. No one has asked why the patent system gives self-interested patentees the leading role in delineating the scope of their own patents. This Article makes two contributions to the literature. First, it explicitly frames the problem with patent claims as one of patentee self-interest rather than the intrinsic ambiguity of claim language. Second, it provides a counterintuitive answer to the question of why the patent system relies on patentee-drafted claims. Although giving patentees claim-drafting power undoubtedly leads to overbroad patent rights, such an allocation of drafting power is nonetheless socially efficient. This is because the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and the courts lack the information necessary to determine the correct scope of a patent in the first instance. Requiring patentees to write claims forces them to take a position, a process that discloses some of the patentee's private information and reduces the complexity of subsequent decisionmaking by courts and the PTO. While patentees will overclaim, they cannot overclaim too much, and relying on an imperfect claim is better than having a court or the PTO make an uninformed guess in the first instance. The Article concludes by explaining the implications of this insight for the debate over claim construction.",2015,Government & Law
NERChem: adapting NERBio to chemical patents via full-token features and named entity feature with chemical sub-class composition,; RECOGNITION,"Chemical patents contain detailed information on novel chemical compounds that is valuable to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In this paper, we introduce a system, NERChem that can recognize chemical named entity mentions in chemical patents. NERChem is based on the conditional random fields model (CRF). Our approach incorporates (1) class composition, which is used for combining chemical classes whose naming conventions are similar; (2) BioNE features, which are used for distinguishing chemical mentions from other biomedical NE mentions in the patents; and (3) full-token word features, which are used to resolve the tokenization granularity problem. We evaluated our approach on the BioCreative V CHEMDNER-patent corpus, and achieved an F-score of 87.17% in the Chemical Entity Mention in Patents (CEMP) task and a sensitivity of 98.58% in the Chemical Passage Detection (CPD) task, ranking alongside the top systems.",2016,Mathematical & Computational Biology

PATENT OFFICE COHORTS,; SOCIALIZATION TACTICS; EXPERIENCE; COMMITMENT; CAREER,"Concerns regarding low-quality patents and inconsistent decisions prompted Congress to enact the first major patent reform act in over sixty years and likewise spurred the Supreme Court to take a renewed interest in substantive patent law. Because little compelling empirical evidence exists as to what features affect the patent office's granting behavior, policymakers have been trying to fix the patent system without understanding the root causes of its dysfunction. This Article aims to fill at least part of this gap by examining one factor that may affect patent examiners' grant rates throughout their tenures: the year in which they were hired by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). An examiner may develop a general examination style in the critical early stages of her career that persists even in the face of changes in application quality or patent allowance culture at the agency. To the extent initial hiring environments influence a newly hired examiner's practice style, variations in such initial conditions suggest examiners of different hiring cohorts may follow distinct, enduring pathways with their examination practices. Consistent with this prediction, we find strong evidence that the year an examiner was hired has a lasting effect on her granting patterns over the course of her career. Moreover, we find that the variation in the granting patterns of different PTO cohorts aligns with observed fluctuations in the initial conditions faced by such cohorts. By documenting the existence of cohort effects and by demonstrating the importance of initial environments in explaining certain long-term outcomes, this analysis holds various implications for patent policy and the administrative state more generally.",2016,Government & Law

Consequently, this study argues for an improvement of women's access to medicines within the context of patent law and rights, the available flexibilities in the international IP regime of the Trade Related Aspect of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and Nigeria's national patent system. Towards this goal, the article makes the point that patent law and its exclusive rights, both the TRIPS Agreement and national law of Nigeria, do not exist in a social welfare vacuum. The legal text of patent law, which confers rights on inventors when enforced, translates to many other things outside the sphere of property rights; indeed, it can be a matter of life and death. It is argued in this regard that patent right could, in effect, interfere with access to medicines and therefore, the right to health and prospects for human development. This study adopts a doctrinal methodology to examine, analyse, and evaluate the issues that have arisen in the context of patent protection of pharmaceuticals and its effect on access medicines. It concludes that while the hindrances to accessibility of essential drugs in Nigeria are multifaceted and demand a multidimensional approach for a lasting solution, the TRIPS flexibilities are significant means for addressing the challenges of affordable access to important health treatments within the context of patent law. However, it is emphasised that utilising the flexibilities will require that Nigeria's patent system is strategically designed to take full advantage of the available exceptions, safeguards, and options.",2019,Government & Law

Repealing Patents,; HISTORY; CHANCERY,"The first known patent case in the United States courts did not enforce a patent. Instead, it sought to repeal one. The practice of cancelling granted patent rights has appeared in various forms over the past two-and-a-quarter centuries, from the earliest U.S. patent law in 1790 to the new regime of inter partes review and post-grant review. With the Supreme Court's recent scrutiny of the constitutionality of inter partes review, this history has taken on a new significance. This Article uses new archival sources to uncover the history of patent cancellation during the first half-century of American patent law. These sources suggest that the early statutory provisions for repealing patents were more widely used and more broadly construed than has hitherto been realized. They also show that some U.

It then follows by explaining the natural patent doctrine and utilitarian doctrine of patent law to understand the theoretic standpoint of biotechnological patents and the differences in theoretic approach that exist between the U.S. and Europe. The article then discusses the notion of method claims for therapeutic purposes and provides a comparison of the patentability criteria in Europe and the U.S. to understand how the substantive patent law contributes to the grant of method claims, and to what extent they differ on both continents. The last section of the article discusses the most relevant case law for genetic material and diagnostic tests, bringing into focus the scope of the substantive patent law and its possible effects on the competition process, which eventually can result in negative consequences to adequate access to patient healthcare.",2019,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology
"EXPIRED PATENTS, TRADE SECRETS, AND STYMIED COMPETITION",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; DISCLOSURE; MARKET; RIGHTS; DELAY; LAW,"Patents and trade secrecy have long been considered substitute incentives for innovation. When inventors create a new invention, they traditionally must choose between the two. And if inventors choose to patent their invention, society provides strong legal protection in exchange for disclosure, with the understanding that the protection has a limit: it expires twenty years from the date of filing. At that time, the invention is opened to the public and exposed to competition. This story is incomplete. Patent disclosure is weak and focuses on one technical piece of an invention but that piece is often only a part of the market-relevant innovation. Patent-holding innovators use various tactics to distort the patent bargain and prolong effective monopolies beyond the patent's expiration date. These tactics include using patented inventions to generate secret information, relying on the timing difference between patent filing and product marketing to make disclosure nearly irrelevant, and tying secret components to patented frameworks. While these phenomena have been noted before, this Article joins them together as examples of ways that innovators avoid the competition-promoting function of patent expiration, ultimately limiting the benefit the public receives from patented inventions. It also suggests that the most problematic cases likely involve markets where additional factors, such as regulation or other market irregularities, require that goods be interchangeable. Finally, it proposes the concept of economic enablement: patentees may have a responsibility to enable not just the bare technical invention disclosed in a patent, but rather the minimum information necessary to exploit commercially the patented invention. Against the background of the newly enacted Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act, courts and scholars alike should examine the boundaries between trade secrets and patents to ensure that the overlap does not distort the policy goal of incentivizing and promoting both innovation and competition.",2017,Government & Law
Dependent Patents Under Art. 31 TRIPS: Lessons from Copyright Law,; TOOLS,"Under the TRIPS regime, compulsory licences for the exploitation of dependent patents are governed by the specific provision of Article 31(l) TRIPS. Hitherto, this provision is of very limited practical relevance; in fact, there is almost no case law and only a little amount of literature on Article 31(l) TRIPS. Essentially, the paper argues in favour of a functional and relative approach to the interpretation of the main Article 31(l) TRIPS condition, i.e. that (i) the invention claimed in the second (dependent) patent shall involve an important technical advance of considerable economic significance in relation to the invention claimed in the first patent. The paper draws on copyright law doctrine of transformative use to argue that both substantive conditions of Article 31(l)(i) TRIPS should be interpreted consistently with regard to the relation to the primary patent, i.e. a lower threshold should apply if the primary patent embodies only an incremental technical advance.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Unconstitutional supranational arrangements for patent law: leaving out the elected legislators and the people's participatory rights,Democratic governance; EPO; UPC; unified patent court; unitary patent; IP; separation of powers; economic law; ,"Substantive economic law in the context of patents creates industrial property rights and monopolies in almost all fields of technology, affecting considerably the economic and social well-being of the state and its people. The mass nationalisation of the international patents of the European Patent Office (EPO) has long raised serious questions about democratic control, in view of the reality that most of its patents are taken by large companies and corporations from a small number of states, mostly from outside the EU. The EU has recently expanded this system by creating a federal (unitary) patent framework consisting of the EPO and a new international court, the Unified Patent Court (UPC), that abolishes the already limited national control. But how can national control ever be totally abolished, especially in such an important social-economic context? And, can the EU exercise effective democratic control of the federal system that it has created? The observed constitutional asymmetries of a federal/unitary patent system that is created in the absence of a federation and is based on two non-EU bodies (EPO, UPC) no longer guarantee the democratic participatory rights of the people for whose benefit economic rules and property rights are justified, regulated and applied.",2019,Government & Law

Institutional Design and the Nature of Patents,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ASSIGNMENT,"What is a patent? That is, what is the nature of a patent? This question has split patent law. Some scholars (and judges) have argued that patents should be understood as a species of property, akin to plots of land, while others have reasoned that patents are best understood as a type of regulatory license, like Environmental Protection Agency permits to pollute. This debate has assumed multiple methodological forms as well. Some scholars (and judges) have approached the question from a formalist perspective, asking what other legal instruments patents most resemble, or how they have been treated historically. Others have approached it from a more functionalist perspective, asking instead what purpose patents are meant to serve and what legal rules would best effectuate that purpose. This debate has significant ramifications for many of patent law's most important institutional questions, including the allocation of power between the Federal Circuit and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), the constitutionality of inter partes review, and the legality of the PTO Director's practice of choosing which patent judges should sit on Patent Trial and Review Board panels. Yet the debate has also largely been submerged. Courts and scholars have often failed to recognize this central schism in patent law. The result is that proponents of each side of the debate have frequently talked past one another without acknowledging the fundamental conceptual principles that divide them. The primary object of this Essay is to describe and explain the deep structure of this disagreement. The Essay then turns to the institutional consequences of arriving at a conclusion regarding the nature of patents. I demonstrate that once one has arrived at a conceptual understanding of patents, answers to the most consequential institutional questions fall neatly into place.",2019,Government & Law
Intangible machines: Patent protection for software in the United States,Computers; intellectual property; patents; software; USA; LAW,"Intellectual property law has been interacting with software for over sixty years. Despite this, the law in this area remains confused and uncertain: this is particularly evident in patent law. Focusing on U.S. patent law from the 1960s through to the mid-1970s, this article argues that a key reason for this confusion relates to the particular way that the subject matter was construed. While the early discussions about subject matter eligibility were framed in terms of the question is software patentable?, what was really at stake in these debates was the preliminary ontological question: what is software? Building on work that highlights the competing ways that software was construed by different parts of the information technology industry at the time, the article looks at the particular way that the law responded to these competing interpretations and how in so doing it laid the foundation for the confusion that characterizes the area. When engaging with new types of subject matter, patent law has consistently relied on the relevant techno-scientific communities not only to provide the law with a relatively clear understanding of the nature of the subject matter being considered; they have also provided the means to allow the law to describe, demarcate, and identify that new subject matter. The inherently divided nature of the nascent information technology industry meant that this was not possible. As a result, the law was forced to develop its own way of dealing with the would-be subject matter.",2019,History & Philosophy of Science
"Photocopies, Patents, and Knowledge Transfer: The Uneasy Case of Justice Breyer's Patentable Subject Matter Jurisprudence",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; SCIENTIFIC-RESEARCH; SCIENCE; NORMS; RETHINKING; COPYRIGHT; LIFE; LAW,"One aspect of Justice Stephen Breyer's discomfort with patents, as expressed in his opinion for the Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus and his dissent from the order dismissing certiorari in LabCorp v. Metabolite, is strikingly similar to one of his critiques of copyright law in The Uneasy Case for Copyright, a well-known article he wrote as Professor Breyer more than forty-five years ago. In The Uneasy Case, Breyer argued that the burdens on duplication of technical articles imposed by copyright law restrict the flow of information and prevent scientists from enjoying spillover benefits of published research. His patent opinions on the Supreme Court, too, talk of diminished access to information resulting from intellectual property protection. In this Article, I contend that the parallel that Justice Breyer implicitly draws between the harms of copyright and patent is a questionable one. In particular, Justice Breyer's opinions on patentable subject matter do not address the notion that inducement of disclosure and dissemination of information is one of the very purposes of patent law, nor the idea that there are many noninfringing uses of information contained in patents. I argue that these omissions may provide an insight into Justice Breyer's patent law jurisprudence-particularly, the recent reinvigoration of limits on patentable subject matter in his opinion for the Court in Mayo.",2016,Government & Law

The interaction between prohibited abuse of market power under EU competition law and national intellectual property rights has been a perennial issue for courts on both the EU and the member-state level. The issue became even more complicated by the ongoing standardization movement which raised concerns about the anticompetitive nature of standardization agreements and possible implications for compulsory licensing. The practical question was the availability of injunctive relief for infringements of patents that are essential to an established market standard.

PATENTING AROUND FAILURE,; FILE-DRAWER PROBLEM; DARK DATA; SCIENCE; SYSTEM; CLAIMS; LAW; PUBLICATION; DISCLOSURE; DOCTRINE; PROPOSAL,"Many patents cover inventions that do not work as described. Fingers often point to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Patent Office), which is criticized for doing a poor job of examining patents. But the story is more complicated for at least three reasons. First, the Patent Office is at a clear disadvantage from an information standpoint. Inventors have little incentive to disclose failure because it might compromise patentability. Second, an inventor is not required to actually make everything that is claimed (or verify that everything that is claimed actually works) before filing a patent application. Third, inventors have an incentive to file patent applications early in the inventive process. Often, filing occurs during the initial stages of research and development, before much experimentation has been done and when the level of uncertainty is high. Together, these factors set the stage for an issued patent covering subject matter that does not work as described. Of course, inventors continue to experiment during the years of patent examination. This additional experimentation inevitably reveals more information about the invention than the inventor knew at the time of filing, including if any of the claimed subject matter fails to work as described in the patent application. This raises an important issue that has been overlooked by both courts and scholars: When post-filing experimentation reveals that some of the claimed subject matter does not work, is there a duty to act? This Article argues when failure comes to light the inventor has a legal obligation to, at a minimum, amend the claims. It then explains how to encourage inventors to disclose details about the failure in the patent record. This additional disclosure would have several upsides for the inventor: it would improve patent (examination) quality, enrich the public storehouse of technical knowledge, and promote the broader goals of the patent system.",2018,Government & Law
NON-JURISDICTIONAL FORMS OF PATENT RIGHTS PROTECTION IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION,protection of patent rights; non-jurisdictional forms; self-defense; claim; warning; mediation; ,"This article discusses the features of the implementation of non-jurisdictional forms of protection of civil rights (self-defense, claims, mediation) in relation to patent infringements in the Russian Federation. It is noted that the self-defense of patent rights by classical means in non-contractual legal relations is limited due to the peculiarities of the legal nature of the objects of patent rights, namely because of their intangible nature, the general availability of information about them, the presence of state registration, but it is possible to use special means of self-defense: software and hardware, introduction trade secrets, optimization of patenting and legal protection strategies as know-how. It is concluded that it is necessary to specify the provisions of Articles 1252 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation and Articles 14.1. - 14.3. Federal Law on the Protection of Competition regarding the assessment of good faith / unfairness of the distribution by the patent holder of warnings about the alleged violation of his rights and apply the approach according to which: the patent holder has the right to protect his exclusive right, and also in case of threat of negative consequences from third parties, to disseminate information about the alleged, in his opinion, a violation of his rights, including against the alleged offender, as well as other persons, including buyers / p purchasers of goods, works, services of the patent holder or the alleged infringer, which in itself is not an act of unfair competition.",2019,Social Issues
"PATENTS, DISCLOSURE, AND BIOPIRACY",; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; INNOVATION; PLANTS,"One of the core requirements of patentability is that patent applicants provide background and contextual information about their invention to the patent office. This disclosure is expected to allow a patent examiner to ensure that the application meets patentability standards. However, because of the information asymmetry between expert patent applicants and generalist patent examiners, applicants can withhold useful information while still receiving the benefits of exclusive patent rights. While this is a problem in the patent system in general, the challenge is even worse in a subset of inventions. The information asymmetry is more pronounced in cases of inventions that rely on the genetic resource or traditional knowledge (TK) of indigenous peoples and local communities in their research. A good example is the practice of using traditional medicinal knowledge as research leads to develop modern drugs. Aspirin is one of the drugs developed out of traditional practices. A core question in these situations is whether patent applicants that rely on TK to develop their invention are required to disclose such information to the patent examiner. Reports of multiple instances show that patent applicants usually withhold information about their reliance on TK in their inventive process. As a result, they may claim exclusive property rights over what source communities have been practicing for generations. In reaction to the lack of recognition of their contribution, source communities are adopting a protectionist trend by creating restrictions on access to their resources. This Article argues that the introduction of an explicit requirement in U.S. patent law, compelling patent applicants to disclose their use of TK, can create an efficient patent system and sustainable relationships in the relevant industries. It provides two justifications for the amendment of U.S. patent law. First, the Article makes a normative case for conceiving the disclosure of origin requirement as an information-forcing rule. Imposing an obligation to disclose the source of TK would elicit socially beneficial information about the validity and scope of a claimed application from the low-cost providers-patent applicants-thereby creating a more efficient patent system. Second, the Article argues that an explicit and enforceable disclosure requirement would reverse the inefficient and troubling protectionist trend by facilitating the tracking and enforcement of obligations that researchers may have in contracts with source communities or domestic laws of source countries. The requirement will create confidence in the patent system and encourage source communities to facilitate access to TK. The Article uses efficiency and social-welfare perspectives in contrast to the equity and distributive justice justifications dominating the literature. The focus of this Article on domestic U.S. law is another point of contrast to the focus of the literature on international law.",2019,Government & Law
Patent Schisms,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY; COMMERCIALIZATION; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; SOFTWARE; TROLLS; RIGHTS; NORMS; FAITH,"Parties frequently obtain patents for one purpose, only to use those patents for another. This Article calls such divergences between parties' initial motivations to obtain patents and those patents' predominant uses later on patent schisms. Because traditional patent law theories typically treat the purposes of patents as static, scholars have neglected to explicitly examine patent schisms and the reasons behind them. This is so despite the pervasiveness of patent schisms in a variety of important contexts. Those contexts include the patenting behaviors of early-stage companies, later-stage companies, so-called patent trolls, and universities. In fact, patent schisms lie at the heart of some of the most controversial patent law topics, including whether patents should be considered a form of personal property or, instead, as a regulatory right. This Article examines patent schisms and adds to the patent literature in three principal ways. First, it provides an account of the ubiquity of patent schisms in a variety of important settings. Second, it articulates three theories explaining how and why patent schisms arise. These hypotheses include the proposition that patenting an invention often creates economic and psychological incentives to ultimately use that patent in defiance of a party's original motivation to obtain the patent. Finally, the Article examines the normative and theoretical implications of the pervasiveness of patent schisms and the explanations behind them. These include briefly assessing whether treating patents as a form of personal property is the correct approach to ensuring that the patent system serves its constitutional purpose of promoting the progress of science and the useful arts.",2018,Government & Law

RITALIN TO ROUNDUP: EXPANDING THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY STATUTORY EXPERIMENTAL USE EXCEPTION TO AGRICULTURE,; PATENTS; SCIENCE; GENES; DNA; ACT,"The modern agricultural biotechnology industry developed from a small cottage industry based on selective crop breeding into a multibillion dollar industry based on the isolation and insertion of genes that code for commercially valuable crop traits. As it grew, the industry relied on patent protection to recoup its investment into new research and development of genetically engineered (GE) crops. A recent billion dollar patent infringement damage award to Monsanto based only on research activities of its competitors testifies to the importance of that patent protection. Had the Monsanto patent infringement case been between two pharmaceutical companies creating genetics based drugs, the outcome would have been different. Instead of a one billion dollar award, the patent verdict would have been one of noninfringement. The difference between the two patent infringement cases lies with the Hatch-Waxman Act's statutory experimental use exception. The Hatch Waxman Act controls the regulation of generic drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Along with an abbreviated generic drug approval process, the Hatch Waxman Act includes a statutory experimental use exception to patent infringement allowing pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on patented drugs if the research might be used in a regulatory submission to the FDA. This Article explores the history of the statutory experimental use exception and argues that it should apply to the agricultural biotechnology industry's development of GE crops. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the statute has resulted in a very broad experimental use exception, limited only by whether an invention is regulated by the FDA. Since GE crops are regulated by the FDA, the statutory experimental use exception should apply to their development. Such a broadening of the experimental use exception would have potentially vast impacts on the patent valuations as well as the structure of the entire agricultural biotechnology industry.",2016,Government & Law

We find a significant decrease in the number of patents and patent citations for firms that are subject to Section 404 compliance relative to firms that are not. This relation is more pronounced when firms are financially constrained and when firms face high litigation risk. Overall, our evidence suggests that SOX imparts real costs to the economy by decreasing corporate innovativeness.",2019,Business & Economics

Our aims are (1) to relate this story about patents, research tools, and impediments to medical progress, and (2) to inform ongoing debates about how patents affect research, disposition of university inventions, and the distribution of benefits from publicly funded research. We present an account of the hunt for Alzheimer's genes, their patenting, assignment, and enforcement based on literature, litigation records and judicial decisions. While AIA's litigation eventually failed, its suits against 18 defendants, including one university, one foundation, and three non-profit organizations were costly in court years, legal fees, and expert time. Reasons for the failure included non-disclosure of co-inventors, State laws on ownership and assignment of university inventions, and enablement. We discuss the policy implications of the litigation, questioning the value of patents in the research ecosystem and the role of NPEs (patent trolls) in biotechnological innovation. The case illustrates tactics that may be deployed against NPEs, including, avenues to invalidate patent claims, Authorization and Consent, legislative reforms specifically targeting NPEs, reforms in the America Invents Act, and judicial action and rules for judicial proceedings. In the highly competitive research environment of Alzheimer's genetics in the 1990s, patents played aminor, subordinate role in spurring innovation. The case produces a mixed message about the patent system. It illustrates many mistakes in how patents were obtained, administered, and enforced, but, eventually, the legal system rectified these mistakes, albeit slowly, laboriously, and at great cost.",2015,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine
Indian pharmaceutical patent prosecution: The changing role of Section 3(d),; TRIPS IMPLEMENTATION; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES,"India, like many developing countries, only recently began to grant pharmaceutical product patents. Indian patent law includes a provision, Section 3(d), which tries to limit grant of secondary pharmaceutical patents, i.e. patents on new forms of existing molecules and drugs. Previous research suggests the provision was rarely used against secondary applications in the years immediately following its enactment, and where it was, was redundant to other aspects of the patent law, raising concerns that 3(d) was being under-utilized by the Indian Patent Office. This paper uses a novel data source, the patent office's first examination reports, to examine changes in the use of the provision. We find a sharp increase over time in the use of Section 3(d), including on the main claims of patent applications, though it continues to be used in conjunction with other types of objections to patentability. More surprisingly, see a sharp increase in the use of the provision against primary patent applications, contrary to its intent, raising concerns about potential over-utilization.",2018,Science & Technology - Other Topics

As we demonstrate in this review, this is not the case in the European Union (EU). The national patent acts of the EU member states define research and experimental use exemptions from patent infringement that allow sufficient room for research activities to promote innovation. This review provides a comparative overview of the legal requirements and the extent and limitations of experimental use exemptions, including the so-called Bolar provision, in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy, and The Netherlands. The legal framework in the respective countries is illustrated with reference to practical examples concerning tests on patent-protected genetic targets and antibodies.

Prior empirical studies mainly focus on strength of patent regulations largely ignoring the enforcement of such laws in practice. We employ a new index that accounts for the enforcement related component of the patent system and the Ginarte and Park (1997) index of patent regulatory strength. We thus include two crucial elements of a national patent system, the de jure position relating to book law and IPR regulations, and the de facto position relating to IPR enforcement. We consider nonlinearities between IPR and innovation, and we find that both nonlinearities and the enforcement aspect are significant in explaining the relationship between innovation and IPR systems.

IS THE AIA THE END OF GRACE?

Evidence for a broader reading includes the effect of each interpretation on the administrative burden at the Patent and Trademark Office, speed of patent disclosure, innovative activity by specific inventor groups, and inventor behavior in patent races. This analysis shows that a narrow interpretation of the grace period creates greater administrative burdens, discourages disclosure, disfavors small inventors and universities, and may make blocking firms in a patent race virtually costless. In contrast, a broad grace period is simpler to administer, accelerates disclosure, supports innovation by small inventors and universities, and provides firms with a defensive maneuver in patent races.",2015,Government & Law

Considerations beyond technical merit are generally in play. For better or worse, one of those considerations is often the understanding that intellectual property may protect a candidate solution. Of the four types of intellectual property - patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets - the one that looms largest in the standards-development context is patents.

A NEW MODEL FOR OVERSIGHT OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES BY NONPROFITS?,; REVENUES; TAXATION; LAW,"This Note discusses a New Jersey tax case, Fields v.

The plaintiffs were twenty-eight municipal taxpayers in Princeton who challenged Princeton University's entire property-tax exemption on the ground that the way the University distributed royalty payments from patents to faculty inventors and licensed these patents in joint ventures and other partnerships ran afoul of the profit test that applies to educational property-tax exemptions in New Jersey. This Note uses this litigation to discuss a potential conflict between the Bayh-Dole Act, which encourages academic patent development, and such profit tests on charitable and educational property exemptions in several states.

Physicalism and Patent Theory,; LAW; PROPERTY; MODELS; REDUCTION; ENTITIES; TROLLS; RIGHTS,"United States patent law's view on the need for a physical embodiment of the invention, and the continued production and use of an embodiment, has varied over the last two centuries. In the early days, the requirement for physicalism was high, with the inventor being required to actually reduce the invention to practice prior to patenting, and enforceability was tied to working the claimed invention. By the early 1900s, these requirements of physicalism disappeared. This changing view on physicalism speaks volumes as to which major patent theory the law emphasizes, with physicalism supporting the incentive to invent theory and the shift away from this physicalism bringing the disclosure theory to the forefront. This interplay between physicalism and patent theory, particularly regarding post-issuance physicalism, not only explains the past, it also describes the current discourse regarding, and legal reaction to, non-practicing entities (NPEs). Decisions such as eBay v. MercExchange, denying exclusivity to NPEs, once again emphasize physicalism and are interrelated to the incentive to invent and, in turn, downplay the disclosure theory and question its current validity as a patent policy goal.",2016,Government & Law

Drawing on these methodological approaches, this article attends to the technicalities and materialities of patent ownership and benefit sharing in South Africa in regards to San peoples' struggles over the patenting of the Hoodia gordonii plant. An examination of patent documents, benefit-sharing agreements, legislative appendixes, and the biology of plants generates an understanding of how patent ownership, rather than being natural or value-neutral, is a historical and sociocultural process shaping, refashioning, and being inscribed across multiple scales of nation-state jurisdictions, divergent ways of knowing, and biochemical orderings of plants.",2016,Anthropology
PATENT EXPERIMENTALISM,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; EXPERIMENTAL TESTS; CONTROLLED-TRIALS; EX ANTE; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; POLICY; LAW,"MANY scholars have wrestled with what I call the first-order question in patent law: What policies should we adopt to promote innovation? This Article grapples with the second-order question: What policies should we adopt to promote innovation about promoting innovation? I argue that empirical progress in patent law depends on greater policy diversity (rather than the current emphasis on uniformity), but unconstrained laboratories of experimentation are suboptimal due to the spillovers from local policies. Instead, patent policy makers should adopt a third way between uniformity and local control: centralized promotion of policy variation. The optimal approach to such policy experimentation depends on the context. Randomized policy experiments should be used more often, both in the field (for example, testing prizes in a random selection of pharmaceutical classes) and in the lab (for example, testing how varying disclosure affects performance in implementing software patents). But many nuanced, dynamic issues such as the patent-eligibility of new technologies in heterogeneous jurisdictions are better approached not through fixed experiments, but rather through an adaptive experimentalist governance regime. Local actors patent examiners, judges, or even individual countries should be granted broad discretion to meet centrally defined framework goals, with the requirement of defending their decisions through robust peer review. Even where controlled experiments are infeasible, experimentalist policies could elicit local knowledge, generate varied observational data, and encourage more robust theory development about the mechanisms by which innovation policies work This pluralistic, evidence-based approach to patent policy can be guided by recent trends in personalized and evidence-based medicine, and the resulting framework for legal experimentation has implications for policy learning beyond patent law.",2015,Government & Law
Patenting Stem Cell Technologies in Europe,; ,"European patent law as it applies to stem cell technologies is complex. The complexities have developed from different supranational sources of law during the last 50 years and from the various levels of exceptions to patentability embodied in the law. In relation to stem cells of human embryonic origin, the definition of a human embryo, although broad, is still in some respects unclear; and the definition of what constitutes the use of a human embryo for industrial or commercial purposes, which is excluded from patentability in Europe, is also remarkably broad. Further clarification is awaited from the courts and from the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office.",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine

The Activated Clotting Time Paradox Relationship Between Activated Clotting Time and Occlusion of the Radial Artery When Used as Vascular Access for Percutaneous Coronary Procedures,humans; incidence; logistic models; odds ratio; radial artery; TRANSRADIAL CATHETERIZATION; PATENT HEMOSTASIS; INTERVENTION; ANGIOGRAPHY; PREVENTION; HEPARIN; PROPHET,"Background: Radial artery occlusion (RAO) is a thrombotic complication of transradial catheterization that can lead to permanent occlusion of the radial artery. Sheath-vessel diameter ratio, postprocedure compression time, occlusive hemostasis, and insufficient anticoagulation are all predictors of RAO. However, excessive anticoagulation can lead to longer time to achieve complete hemostasis and less patent hemostasis rate. This study was designed to assess the relationship among residual anticoagulation at the end of a percutaneous coronary procedure and the risk of RAO. Methods: Eight hundred thirty-seven patients undergoing transradial catheterization were enrolled. Activated clotting time (ACT) was measured before sheath removal. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to ACT values (ACT <150 s, ACT between 150 and 249 s, ACT >250 s), patent hemostasis with reverse Barbeau test was attempted in all patients, and compression device removed as soon as possible. Within 24 hours, patency of radial artery was checked by Doppler using reverse Barbeau technique. Results: Incidence of RAO was higher for the extreme ACT values. Patent hemostasis were less frequently obtained and time to hemostasis significantly longer for increasing ACT values (P=0.004 for trend and <0.0001 for trend, respectively). At logistic regression analysis, ACT values <150 s were an independent predictor of RAO (odds ratio, 3.53; 95% IC, 1.677-7.43; P=0.001) while adjusted probability for RAO confirmed U-shaped relationship with ACT values. Conclusions: The level of anticoagulation is strongly related to incidence of RAO and should be measured objectively by ACT.",2019,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
The continuing saga of patents and non-invasive prenatal testing,; ,"Objective This paper examines the Intellectual Property (IP) landscape for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in three key regions: the United States; Europe, with particular focus on the United Kingdom; and Australia. Method We explore the patent law issues against the commercial and healthcare environment in these regions and consider the implications for development and implementation of NIPT. Results There are many patents held by many parties internationally, with litigation over these patents ongoing in many countries. Importantly, there are significant international differences in patent law, with patents invalidated in the USA that remain valid in Europe. Despite the many patents and ongoing litigation, there are multiple providers of testing internationally, and patents do not appear to be preventing patient access to testing for those who can pay out of pocket. Conclusion The patent situation in NIPT remains in a state of flux, with uncertainty about how patent rights will be conferred in different jurisdictions, and how patents might affect clinical access. However, patents are unlikely to result in a monopoly for a single provider, with several providers and testing technologies, including both public and private sector entities, likely to remain engaged in delivery of NIPT. However, the effects on access in public healthcare systems are more complex and need to be monitored.",2019,Genetics & Heredity; Obstetrics & Gynecology

COUNTERPRODUCTIVE NOTICE IN LITERALISTIC VERSUS PERIPHERAL CLAIMING,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PATENT; CONSTRUCTION,"Providing clear notice of property rights is a worthwhile goal, but legal requirements for notice can also thwart that goal. If the law imposes unrealistic notice requirements and invalidates the whole right as a penalty for non-compliance, the enforcement mechanism can weaken notice by transforming imprecision at the edges of the property right (where uncertainty is greatest) into uncertainty throughout the entirety of the right. The paradox associated with such notice requirements is evident in modern patent claiming doctrine. Under current Federal Circuit law, patent claims are treated as precise verbal descriptions demarcating the outer edges of patent rights, and with minor exceptions, the patentee is assumed to have rights to everything that falls within the literal bounds of the claim. That literalistic claiming method deviates sharply from the peripheral claiming method that was dominant throughout most of the twentieth century. This essay gives reasons for believing (1) that the Federal Circuit's current approach to claiming is inconsistent with both Supreme Court and prior circuit case law in several significant respects; (2) that the Federal Circuit's current approach is irreconcilable with principles of rights definition in other areas of property law; and (3) that a seemingly less precise approach to patent claiming might produce better notice and otherwise be more consistent with good patent policy. The essay concludes with practical suggestions concerning how the Federal Circuit's approach to patent claiming can be changed.",2016,Government & Law

Critics have argued that the first-to-file rule rewards speed in patent applications rather than creativity, thereby undermining innovation. We evaluate this concern within a dynamic model of a patent race, and find first-to-invent (weakly) more conducive to innovation than first-to-file. Defending prior users' rights can promote both pro- and anti-R&D effect of a switch to first-to-file.",2015,Business & Economics
On the transfer of technology from universities: The impact of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 on the institutionalization of university research,Bayh-Dole Act; Technology transfer; Patenting; Structural change; CHANGE-POINT; STRUCTURAL-CHANGE; TESTS; SEQUENCE; PARAMETER; BREAKS,"While the academic and policy literature has focused on patent counts and patent quality as possible outcome measures to evaluate the impact of the U.S. Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, we argue that the impact of the Act on university effort to transfer its technology to the private sector might be seen more accurately by examining the trend in the initial establishment of technology transfer offices (TTOs). Using an econometric framework to identify the presence of multiple structural breaks in data on the annual number of university TTOs, we find multiple break dates over the period 1925 to 2014. One break date was in the late-1960s and a second break date occurred about 1982. We suggest, in contrast to previous findings in the literature, that the Act did have an impact on the formal internal transfer of technology from universities through patenting by providing an incentive for universities to invest in a TTO research infrastructure. We also suggest that our empirical methodology is applicable to an assessment of the impact of legislation similar to the Bayh-Dole Act in the many countries with such legislation.

Knowledge Adaptability Evaluation in View of Patent Citation in Technological Evolutionary Process: A Case Study of Fuel Cell,Technological evolution; patent citation network; knowledge adaptation factor; knowledge genetic decomposition; TRAJECTORIES; GROWTH; SYSTEM; DESIGN,"This work uses patents as agent and proposes the concept of knowledge adaptation factor in view of the objective law of survival of the fittest in technological evolutionary process. Knowledge genetic decomposition of a patent citation network is executed based on the Mendel law. And the contributions of early patents on current patents along patent citations are quantified to evaluate knowledge adaptability. Then the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge adaptability evaluation method are verified with the case study of fuel cell. This study collects 3054 patents related to fuel cell which were granted between 1873 to 2002 from the database of United States Patent and Trademark Office, queries from the patent data set of National Bureau of Economic Research to get 14214 patent citations, and uses the network analysis software Pajek to build the patent citation network. The results of the knowledge adaptability evaluation of fuel cell reflect that the knowledge dissemination process is composed of knowledge inheritance, knowledge innovation and knowledge recombinant. The patents whose knowledge adaptation factors are relatively high are subordinate to the technological evolutionary process of fuel cell. It is consistent with the central idea of knowledge adaptation factor, which is technological-evolution-oriented.",2015,Computer Science; Engineering

Patent validity and the timing of settlements,Patent; Litigation; Infringement; Prior art; Fee shifting; America Invents Act; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; PRIOR ART; LITIGATION; DISPUTES; INFORMATION; SEARCH,"We study the timing of settlement in patent disputes, accounting for an alleged infringer's search for evidence to challenge patent validity. Early settlements are more likely reached when the disputed patent has a low quality, and late settlements take place when the alleged infringer finds strong evidence that challenges patent validity. Thus, there is a tendency to settle disputes over patents that would have likely been invalidated in court. Fee shifting induces more early settlements, and when parties did not settle early, a higher expenditure on invalidating the patent. Our model sheds light on disputes involving patent assertion entities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2019,Business & Economics

In 2013, 38% of US patenting firms had previously pledged patents as collateral, and these firms performed 20% of research and development expense and patenting in Compustat. Employing court decisions as a source of exogenous variation in creditor rights, I show that patenting companies raised more debt, and spent more on R&D, when creditor rights to patents strengthened. Subsequently, these companies exhibited a gradual increase in patenting output and the use of patents as collateral. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2018,Business & Economics

A Functional Approach to Judicial Review of PTAB Rulings on Mixed Questions of Law and Fact,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; PATENT SYSTEM,"The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has long relied on active appellate review to bring uniformity and clarity to patent law. It initially treated the PTO the same as the federal district courts, reviewing its factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. Following reversal by the Supreme Court in Dickinson v. Zurko, the Federal Circuit began giving greater deference to PTO factual findings. But it continued to review the PTO's legal conclusions de novo, while coding an expansive list of disputed issues in patent cases as legal conclusions, even when they rest on subsidiary factfinding. Congress expanded the role of the PTO in adjudicating challenges to patent validity in the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (MA), authorizing new adjudicatory proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) as an alternative to federal district court litigation. The MA provides for Federal Circuit review of PTAB decisions, without specifying standards of review. The scope of review could determine the success of these proceedings as a quicker, cheaper, and more expert alternative to district court litigation of patent challenges. The Federal Circuit applies the same standards of review to PTAB decisions in MA proceedings that it applies to other PTO rulings, reviewing legal conclusions de novo and factual findings for substantial evidence. It also follows the same characterizations of issues as legal or factual that it has long used in the context of court/ court review. In the past, by maximizing the scope of appellate review, these characterizations allowed the Federal Circuit to exercise greater quality control over generalist trial courts with limited competence to resolve patent matters. The net benefits are more dubious as applied to decisions of expert PTAB panels in AIA adjudications. Yet reversal rates at the Federal Circuit are essentially the same for PTAB decisions as for decisions of district courts in patent cases, threatening to frustrate a system designed to improve patent quality while limiting litigation costs. This Essay reconsiders the proper scope of judicial review of PTAB rulings on two issues that the Federal Circuit codes as legal conclusions with factual underpinnings: nonobviousness and claim interpretation. Drawing on a functional approach to judicial review of mixed questions of law and fact, it argues for more deferential review of PTAB rulings on nonobviousness and claim interpretation given the expertise of the administrative tribunal and the case-specificity of the rulings. The Federal Circuit would do better to confine de novo review to generalizable legal rulings that provide guidance in future matters rather than replicating the work of the PTAB from the appellate bench on routine case-specific rulings.",2019,Government & Law

With this in mind, basic chemical utility patents were analyzed to detect the effects of CAA on the patenting activities. Subsequent to the fitting of the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model (producing the least square of errors), a significant outlier was detected with the Dixon's r22 Ratio Test. This outlier was the number of patents granted in 1972. Contextual queries in the text of those patent documents have shown that there was a considerable increase in the patents of chemistry which takes the sustainability relevant terms (air, emission, pollution, etc.) into consideration.

Evaluating AE Reporting of Two Off-Patent Biologics to Inform Future Biosimilar Naming and Reporting Practices,; TRACEABILITY,"Historical studies of voluntary, spontaneous drug reports show poor attribution of adverse events to generic versions of commonly prescribed medications. As biosimilars enter the market place, it may be similarly difficult to accurately attribute adverse events to their respective reference products. At this time, lack of global consensus with regard to biosimilar naming conventions may result in drug reporting confusion, misattribution of adverse events and insufficient active monitoring of safety signals. Now, with the first biosimilar approval in the USA and many biosimilars expected to be launched globally in the near future, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on biosimilar naming conventions will be essential. To inform the FDA and the global drug development community, the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development (Tufts CSDD) examined primary suspect reports sent to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from US reporters for two biologics that have lost patent exclusivity-somatropin and human insulin-and extracted 4703 insulin reports and 6487 somatropin reports from FAERS. The results show that reporting practices are inconsistent between the two biologics that were evaluated and that manufacturer identifiability and traceability are lacking.

Patent implications in the pharmaceutical industry: Are static high prices leading to dynamic innovations?,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PROTECTION; KNOWLEDGE,"Agreement on Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) was laid on the premises of rewarding monopolistic patent rights to the innovator. Stronger patent protection was advocated to promote technology transfer from developed nations to the rest of the world. To boost domestic innovative potential and to maintain trade ties, most developing countries signed the TRIPS agreement. Impact of patent laws in the pharmaceutical industry was crucial as it posed threat to access health. This paper aims to analyze the impact of pharmaceutical product patent laws incorporated under the TRIPS agreement using 65 countries panel dataset from 1995 to 2016. The data is empirically analyzed using negative binomial regression and Poisson regression. Results clearly indicate that the number of pharmaceutical patents filed in US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has decreased after TRIPS compliance in both low and middle income countries. However, the decline is larger in upper middle and lower middle income countries than in low income countries. The phenomenon of low patent activity has an increasingly declining trend across low and middle income countries. Hence the claimed hypothesis that stronger patent rights would increase innovative potential does not seem to stand true, which raises serious affordability concerns of bringing patents in the pharmaceutical sector.",2019,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; General & Internal Medicine"

INTELLIGENT DESIGN,; PATENT; COPYRIGHT; LAW,"When designers obtain exclusive intellectual property (IP) rights in the functional aspects of their creations, they can wield these rights to increase both the costs to their competitors and the prices that consumers must pay for their goods. IP rights and the costs they entail are justified when they create incentives for designers to invest in new, socially valuable designs. But the law must be wary of allowing rights to be misused. Accordingly, IP law has employed a series of doctrinal and costly screens to channel designs into the appropriate regime- copyright law, design patent law, or utility patent law -depending upon the type of design. Unfortunately, those screens are no longer working. Designers are able to obtain powerful IP protection over the utilitarian aspects of their creations without demonstrating that they have made socially valuable contributions. They are also able to do so without paying substantial fees that might weed out weaker, socially costly designs. This is bad for competition and bad for consumers. In this Article, we integrate theories of doctrinal and costly screens and explore their roles in channeling IP rights. We explain the inefficiencies that have arisen through the misapplication of these screens in copyright and design patent laws. Finally, we propose a variety of solutions that would move design protection toward a successful channeling regime, balancing the law's needs for incentives and competition. These proposals include improving doctrinal screens to weed out functionality, making design protection more costly, and preventing designers from obtaining multiple forms of protection for the same design.",2018,Government & Law

REASONABLE PATENT EXHAUSTION,; ,"A lengthy tug of war between the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals may have ended with Impression Products v. Lexmark. The Supreme Court held that the sale of a patented thing exhausts the patentee seller's rights to enforce restrictions on that thing through patent infringement suits. Further, the parties cannot bargain around this rule through the seller's specification of conditions, no matter how clear. No inquiry need be made into the patentee's market power, anticompetitive effects, or other types of harms, whether enforcement of the condition is socially costly or valuable, or whether the condition has a positive or negative impact on innovation. None of this is relevant. Impression Products reveals an economic deficiency that manifests all too frequently when patent law is brought to bear on market practices. Economic concepts that are commonly used in antitrust law, such as market power or output effects, are virtually unknown in patent law. This fact has inclined courts to go to wild extremes-such as equating every patent with monopoly, or concluding that a patent is a mere property right and that anything done within the scope of the patent is permissible. The result, as in this case, can be draconian rules that are indifferent to effects on innovation, competition, economic efficiency, or any other measure that seems relevant to innovation policy. This Article argues that the Supreme Court would have been wise to develop a more nuanced exhaustion rule that examined actual effects likely to result from a particular restraint.",2018,Government & Law
i4i Makes the Patent World Blind,; PRESUMPTION; VALIDITY; LAW,"All patents receive a presumption of validity pursuant to 35 USC & sect; 282. Courts have traditionally put this presumption into practice by requiring invalidity to be established by clear and convincing evidence. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this understanding of the presumption in Microsoft Corp vi4i Ltd Partnership. District courts have divided, however, on whether to require clear and convincing evidence when the challenger seeks to invalidate a patent for covering ineligible subject matter. The conflict originates from a concurrence written by Justice Stephen Breyer in i4i, in which he stated that a heightened standard of proof-like the clear and convincing standard-can apply only to issues of fact, not issues of law. Because subject-matter eligibility has traditionally presented an issue of law, some courts hold that subject-matter-eligibility challenges cannot be subjected to the clear and convincing standard. Other courts agree with that sentiment but would apply the clear and convincing standard to resolve any underlying issues of fact. Still others maintain that subject-matter-eligibility challenges must be established by clear and convincing evidence. This Comment resolves this ambiguity by showing that subject-matter-eligibility challenges must be established by clear and convincing evidence. It compares subject-matter-eligibility challenges to two other patent validity challenges: the on-sale bar and nonobviousness. These two comparisons show that patent law has consistently failed to confine the clear and convincing standard to issues of law. In fact, the standard has been imposed without regard for the distinction between issues of law and fact. Accordingly, judges should impose the clear and convincing standard on subject-matter-eligibility challenges.",2018,Government & Law
The Role of Regulatory Agencies and Intellectual Property: Part II,; ,"Patent law and antitrust law have traditionally been areas of the law involving at least some inherent tension. Champions of antitrust argue that the patent monopoly must be strictly limited as an exception to the general legal principle that competition should be unfettered. Patent lawyers argue that patents are the result of an exercise of congressional authority, enshrined in the Constitution, reflecting the policy decision by the Founders that granting a limited exclusionary rightwas justified by the public benefits derived from full disclosure of the patented invention. In the modern era these competing values have played out in the context of so-called ANDA litigation, involving disputes between branded pharmaceutical companies and generic competitors. Settlement of such litigation has been identified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and private parties encouraged by the FTC's position, as an antitrust violation, in large part because such settlements are viewed as frustrating the congressional purpose in promoting early generic competition. After almost a decade of fighting these battles in the federal courts, the SupremeCourt addressed the issue directly. The result is that such settlements are not per se illegal but are also not protected by the presumption of patent validity for activities within the scope of the patent. Rather, the court decided that these agreements should be assessed for antitrust liability under the rule of reason used in other antitrust contexts.",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine
Can a Court Change the Law by Saying Nothing?,; SUPREME-COURT; DEFERENCE; PATENTS; MYRIAD; RULES,"Can an appellate court alter substantive law without writing an opinion? We attempt to answer that question by conducting a novel empirical investigation into how the Federal Circuit has implemented the Supreme Court's 2014 ruling in Alice v. CLS Bank, the most recent in a series of Supreme Court decisions strengthening patent law's patentable subject matter requirement. Our dataset includes each one of the Federal Circuit's more than 100 decisions on patentable subject matter in the three years since Alice, including affirmances issued without an opinion under Federal Circuit Rule 36. Including those no-opinion affirmances, the Federal Circuit has found the patent to be invalid in more than 90% of its decisions. The court's precedential opinions, however, tell a different story: nearly a quarter of them favor the patentee by rejecting challenges to patent validity. This difference is due largely to one remarkable fact: although the court has issued over fifty Rule 36 affirmances finding the asserted patent to be invalid, it has not issued a single Rule 36 affirmance when finding in favor of a patentee. Rather, it has written an opinion in every one of those cases. As a result, the Federal Circuit's precedential opinions provide an inaccurate picture of how disputes over patentable subject matter are actually resolved. Precedential opinions suggest that any given patent has a decent chance of surviving an eligibility challenge at the Federal Circuit. But, in reality, very few patents do. Our findings suggest that, by saying nothing, a court can indeed affect substantive law, or at least the perception of it.

However, the prize did not prohibit patenting. We use a new dataset of marine chronometer inventors to show that the propensity to patent was high. We argue that while the prize spurred entry by key inventors, and progress payments facilitated research investment in an area of significant social value, patents promoted disclosure. Our findings highlight the importance of complementarities between prize and patent-based incentives in the design of innovation inducement contests.",2017,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics
PATENT UNCERTAINTY: TOWARD A FRAMEWORK WITH APPLICATIONS,; ECONOMICS; LAW,"There are three essential sources of uncertainty in the patent system: perceived uncertainty due to selective sampling (statistical artefact uncertainty), inherent uncertainty, and strategic uncertainty. It is only the strategic uncertainty source that should be of concern to reformers. With respect to this source, uncertainty in the patent system is largely a function of two variables: the degree of inherent abstraction associated with the patent, and the degree to which the patent provides notice of its scope. The maximal degree of uncertainty is observed in the category of abstract patents with poor notice, a category dominated today by software patents. I offer a few principles for validating patents in this category of maximal uncertainty.",2016,Government & Law
The standard essential patent ownership in the global energy interconnection collaborative innovation in China,Global energy interconnection; Collaborative innovation; Standard essential patent; Ownership; INDUSTRY COLLABORATION,"The construction of Global Energy Interconnection is a systematic strategic project, for which the formation of collaborative innovation alliances would provide a strong intellectual support. As there is no existing law specifically applicable to standard essential patents in China, one has to turn to rules on ordinary patents. Nevertheless, the differences between ordinary patents and standard essential patents have given rise to a series of problems with standard essential patent ownership, especially ambiguous legal interpretation, predicament produced by joint ownership, unreasonable rules on service invention ownership. It is an important means to add Appointment Rules in Article 20 of the Science and Technology Progress Law, to promote cooperative innovation alliances' project ownership from contract to articles and to reconstruct the attribution rules of the service inventions. It is also suggested to promote constitutionalization of agreement on ownership within cooperated projects and avoid joint ownership of intellectual property. There is also a need to reform rules on service invention ownership and enhance the employees bargaining power.",2018,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
Continental drift? Do European clinical genetic testing laboratories have a patent problem?,; DNA PATENTS; PROVISION; MYRIAD,"Recent US Supreme Court decisions have invalidated patent claims on isolated genomic DNA, and testing methods that applied medical correlations using conventional techniques. As a consequence, US genetic testing laboratories have a relatively low risk of infringing patents on naturally occurring DNA or methods for detecting genomic variants. In Europe, however, such claims remain patentable, and European laboratories risk infringing them. We report the results from a survey that collected data on the impact of patents on European genetic testing laboratories. The results indicate that the proportion of European laboratories that have refrained from providing associated testing services owing to patent protection has increased over the last decade (up from 7% in 2008 to 15% in 2017), and that the non-profit sector was particularly strongly affected (up from 4% in 2008 to 14% in 2017). We renew calls for more readily available legal support to help public sector laboratories deal with patent issues, but we do not recommend aligning European law with US law at present. Watchful monitoring is also recommended to ensure that patents do not become a greater hindrance for clinical genetic testing laboratories.",2019,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Genetics & Heredity

Through this means of informal harmonisation, progress can be made case-by-case, rather than waiting for legislation to be agreed upon and entered into force. This is already happening to good effect, as displayed through a number of examples, including the most recent example of Actavis v. Eli Lilly [2017] UKSC 48 in the UK Supreme Court. It is proposed by this article that official lines of communication should be opened among all judiciaries and Boards in the European patent system to improve this practice. Judicial cooperation would also be useful to the Unified Patent Court, if it becomes operational. Opening official lines of communication would be an important step towards a further harmonised European patent system and would increase legal certainty in this area.",2019,Government & Law

In this study, we draw a log-log plot of the probability distribution for both the plaintiff and the defendant sides and use a log-transform regression to verify that the patent litigation network degree distribution follows a power-law distribution. We also graph the structure of the network to explore the origin of its asymmetrical pattern. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the patent litigation network over time by calculating the Shannon entropy for each year from 2005 to September 2016. We find the power-law degree distribution, and a few hubs of the patent litigation network are like other real-world networks. We also find that the asymmetrical pattern of the patent litigation network is largely driven by non-practicing entities and the major information technology firms. We conclude that the patent litigation network is becoming more asymmetrical over time based on our finding that its Shannon entropy is decreasing.",2017,Physics

FIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE REMS PATENT PROBLEM,; ,"Two principles collide in the pharmaceutical industry. On the one hand, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves potentially dangerous drugs under Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) programs when a drug's benefits outweigh its risks. But on the other hand, brand firms can prevent generic competition by patenting these programs. REMS patents, which claim compliance with FDA-imposed REMS programs, pose two problems-one procedural, the other substantive. First, current practice is to list REMS patents in the Orange Book even though such listings may be invalid, with this conduct allowing the brand to obtain an automatic 30month stay of generic approval. Second, because a REMS program appears on a product's label and generics must copy that label, REMS patents threaten generics with claims of induced infringement. We offer five solutions to these problems. First, we target brands' listings of REMS patents in the Orange Book, proposing that generic firms sued for infringement file counterclaims to delist REMS patents and that the FDA issue guidance making clear that REMS patents cannot be listed. Second, we suggest more rigorous scrutiny of REMS patents in the courts and at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Third, we apply the Supreme Court's four-factor eBay test to conclude that courts should award damages rather than injunctions in cases of infringement. Fourth, we suggest that Congress amend the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 to mitigate the effects of REMS patents. And fifth, we recommend that, similar to the treatment of tax-strategy patents in the America Invents Act, Congress deem REMS patents to fall within the prior art.",2017,Government & Law
Alienation from the Objectives of the Patent System: How to Remedy the Situation of Biotechnology Patent,Alienation; Patent; Justification; Biotechnology; DISCOVERY; RIGHTS; LAW,"Some fundamental biotechnologies hold unprecedented potential to eradicate many incurable diseases. However, in absence of regulations, the power of patent makes the future use of some important biotechnology in few institution's hands. The excessive patents restrict researcher access to the fundamental technologies. It generates concerns and complaints of deteriorating the public health and social welfare. Furthermore, intellectual curiosities, funding, respect among colleagues etc., rather than patents, are the real motivations driving a major ground-breaking discoveries in biotechnology. These phenomena reveal that some biotechnology patents are alienated from the purpose of patent system.

THE PATENT SPIRAL,; RETHINKING; LITIGATION; INNOVATION; CITATIONS,"Examination-the process of reviewing a patent application and deciding whether to grant the requested patent-improves patent quality in two ways. It acts as a substantive screen, filtering out meritless applications and improving meritorious ones. It also acts as a costly screen, discouraging applicants from seeking low-value patents. Yet despite these dual roles, the patent system has a substantial quality problem: it is both too easy to get a patent (because examiners grant invalid patents that should be filtered out by a substantive screen) and too cheap to do so (because examiners grant low-value nuisance patents that should be filtered out by a costly screen). This Article argues that these flaws in patent screening are both worse and better than has been recognized. The flaws are worse because they are not static, but dynamic, interacting to reinforce each other. This interaction leads to a vicious cycle of more and more patents that should never have been granted. When patents are too easily obtained, that undermines the costly screen, because even a plainly invalid patent has a nuisance value greater than its cost. And when patents are too cheaply obtained, that undermines the substantive screen, because there will be more patent applications, and the examination system cannot scale indefinitely without sacrificing accuracy. The result is a cycle of more and more applications, being screened less and less accurately, to give more and more low-quality patents. And although it is hard to test directly if the quality of patent examination is falling, there is evidence suggesting that this cycle is affecting the patent system. At the same time, these flaws are not as bad as they seem because this cycle may be surprisingly easy to solve. The cycle gives policymakers substantial flexibility in designing patent reforms, because the effect of a reform on one piece of the cycle will propagate to the rest of the cycle. Reformers can concentrate on the easiest places to make reforms (like the litigation system) instead of trying to do the impossible (like eliminating examination errors). Such reforms would not only have local effects, but could help make the entire patent system work better.",2016,Government & Law
Patent Challenge Clauses: A New Antitrust Offense?,; REVERSE-PAYMENT SETTLEMENTS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; UNCERTAINTY; AGREEMENTS; POLICY; LAW,"Patent licensing contracts frequently bar licensees from challenging the validity of the patents at the basis of the contract or penalize such challenges. There is a considerable debate as to whether courts should enforce these clauses. We argue that unenforceability is not enough: Challenge clauses should be illegal under antitrust law. Our argument is based on two grounds. The first, doctrinal route, argues that this new antitrust offense is a natural extension of the logic of the Supreme Court's landmark case of Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc., decided nearly four years ago. The second, normative route, shows that a welfare-enhancing foundation exists for recognizing this antitrust offense. We propose three cumulative conditions that should exist for a new antitrust offense to be realized, and show that they are met in the case of challenge clauses. Our conclusion challenges the existing laws and draws a new line between contract law and antitrust law, which is applicable to other cases as well.",2017,Government & Law
How to Measure and Draw Causal Inferences with Patent Scope,Patent scope; causal inference; innovation; measurement; patent examiners; examiner toughness; ,"This paper presents an easy-to-use measure of patent scope that is grounded both in patent law and in the practices of patent attorneys. We validate our measure by showing both that patent attorneys' subjective assessments of scope agree with our estimates, and that the behavior of patenters is consistent with it. Using our validation exercise, we find that previous measures of patent scope (i.e., the number of patent classes, the number of citations made by future patents, and the number of claims in a patent) are uninformative or misleading. To facilitate drawing causal inferences with our measure, we show how it can be used to create an instrumental variable, patent examiner scope toughness, which we also validate. We then demonstrate the power of this instrument by examining standard-essential patents. We show that an (exogenous) diminishment of patent scope leads to patents being much less likely to be declared standard essential.",2019,Business & Economics
Do patents of academic funded researchers enjoy a longer life? A study of patent renewal decisions,; BAYH-DOLE ACT; QUALITY; CITATIONS; INNOVATION; UNIVERSITIES; INDICATORS,This paper assesses the extent to which patent renewal data is associated with government funding in a university context by focusing on the relationship between the funded patentees and renewal decisions of their patents. The aim of this paper is to show whether receiving funding from government contributes to high-value patents as measured by the patent renewal decisions made by their owners. Our observations of academic nanotechnology patents in Canada discovered a positive relationship between funded researchers and the rate of patent renewal after 4 years. Further analysis is also undertaken into the relative impact on patent renewal after 8 years and 12 years. Our results suggest that the length of patent renewal in numbers of years can be related to levels of government funding received by their inventors.,2018,Science & Technology - Other Topics
FORMATION OF LEGAL PROTECTION OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE BY THE RULES OF COPYRIGHT AND PATENT LAW,legal protection of computer programs; copyright; patent law; ,"Introduction. Computer programs (CP) are one of the newest objects of intellectual property. Neither the norms of copyright or patent law, nor attempts to develop separate legislation have enabled creating a legal mechanism that would not cause significant complaints from stakeholders. Problem Statement. An analysis of the historical factors that led to the choice of different approaches to the legal protection of computer programs enables to better understand the system in each country, to choose the most appropriate ways to acquire the rights and protection of these objects of intellectual property, to defend their property and non-property rights, and to look for new, more reasonable and efficient ways of solving problems in this field. Purpose. To study the world history of the formation and development of legal protection of computer software by the rules of copyright and patent law. Materials and Methods. Critical review of literary sources on intellectual properly and computer science, comparative analysis of international and national legislation of various countries, study of judicial practice that has had the greatest impact on the practical solution to the problem of protecting computer programs. Results. The main stages in the history of the development and formation of ways of legal protection of computer programs have been identified and characterized. Intellectual properly and computer sciences materials, international and national legislation of different countries, jurisprudence, the most important historical events and outstanding inventions in this field have been analyzed. The dominant position of the computer program copyright protection has been established not always to correspond with the rights and interests of their authors who increasingly support the introduction of alternative, patent and legal protection of computer programs by special legislation rather than by the precedent law. Conclusions. It has been proposed to introduce a hybrid copyright-patent way of CP legal protection, which would combine the advantages of both methods, as a compromise solution to the problem of competition between the CP legal protection by means of the copyright and patent law.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics
"Pierson, Peer Review, and Patent Law",; OFFICE; DISCLOSURE,"When has a researcher done enough to merit a patent? Should the patent belong to the researcher who first suggests an invention or the one who brings it to fruition? The canonical dispute over a fox in Pierson v. Post is used to illustrate the competing policy considerations in deciding when to award a new property right, including providing efficient incentives, setting forth clear rules to guide future behavior, and respecting natural rights. In patent law, all of these considerations suggest that in practice, many patents are awarded too early, before an applicant has demonstrated that the invention is likely to work. The main problem seems to be not with the substantive standards but with the Patent Office's institutional competence to enforce these standards. A patent is supposed to teach a researcher of ordinary skill in the field how to make the invention without undue experimentation. Yet it often takes extraordinary skill to recognize when this standard is not met based merely on reading a patent application-expertise that the typical patent examiner lacks. To address this information asymmetry, it is worth experimenting with bringing those of extraordinary skill into the patent examination process through a robust peer review system. So far, opportunities for outside input such as the Peer To Patent pilot project have focused on providing examiners with additional prior art, but peer review would be far more valuable for evaluating patent disclosures to assess whether applicants have in fact done enough work to merit a patent or whether it remains too early in the chase.",2016,Government & Law

Teleflex echoed earlier vicissitudes in the history of patent law when the Court considerably expanded the circumstances in which a patent could be found obvious. Here, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of pre- and post-KSR district court and Federal Circuit decisions. Not surprisingly, following KSR, we find a substantial increase in findings of obviousness as well as a major shift in doctrine supporting these decisions. Although we find that the Federal Circuit substantially altered course following KSR, its shift was less robust than in the district courts. We speculate that these differences between the Federal Circuit and district courts, as well as the vacillating historical meanings of the nonobviousness requirement, reflect divergent views among judges regarding the appropriate role nonobviousness should play in promoting patent law's fundamental aim of incentivizing innovation. As such, we predict continued shifts and cycles of this critical component of patentability.",2019,Government & Law

Even in remedies, where the line persists, the conventional scholarly wisdom favors erasing it. Yet something surprising has happened. In a series of cases over the last decade and a half, the U.S. Supreme Court has acted directly contrary to this conventional wisdom. These cases range across many areas of substantive law-from commercial contracts and employee benefits to habeas and immigration, from patents and copyright to environmental law and national security. Throughout these disparate areas, the Court has consistently reinforced the line between legal and equitable remedies, and it has treated equitable remedies as having distinctive powers and limitations. This Article describes and begins to evaluate the Court's new equity cases. Faced with many federal statutes authorizing equitable relief, the Court has looked to history and tradition to determine what counts as an equitable remedy and also to determine the circumstances in which equitable relief should be given. There have been some blunders, and the Court has taken no account of the complexity of equity's history. On the whole, however, the Court's new equity cases represent a reasonable response to an enduring challenge: how to make sense of equitable doctrines in a world without equitable courts. This conclusion will prove controversial for scholars in remedies and in various substantive fields, but even those who disagree will need to grapple with the new equity cases, for they may shape the law of remedies for decades to come.",2015,Government & Law

"Dispute the patent, short the stock: Empirical analysis of a new hedge fund strategy",Event-study; Stock price effects; Patent oppositions; IPR; AIA; PTAB; ,"A new US patent legislation, called the America Invents Act, became effective in 2011. The reform strived toward facilitating the patent system. But soon it was also blamed for facilitating immoral third party profits. Urges for revision of the America Invents Act became even louder since hedge fund manager Kyle Bass had publicly outlined his questionable investment strategy: he challenges the validity of important drug patents, while shorting the owner's shares in order to eventually cash out on negative stock movements. The following questions aroused public interest the most: Does the mere filing of a patent opposition already result in negative stock returns? And is it really possible to earn money following such a strategy? The paper on hand is the first to empirically answer these questions. Event study methodology using three years of data from the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board was employed. Findings were that the mere filing of a patent opposition in fact produces statistically significant negative returns. The result is robust with the abnormal return being 30 base points. In addition, multiple linear regression results confirm the conjecture that the higher the importance of the disputed patent, the higher the negative abnormal return on the filing date will be. However, transaction cost simulations prove that this strategy is still highly speculative and cannot be considered a real threat to patent holders or the US intellectual property system. The only ones who should start worrying are the few patent owners who really rely on absolutely unjustified and tenuous patent protection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

India's Information Technology Industry: A Tale of Two Halves,Information technology; Information technology-enabled services; Electronics; Software; Outsourcing; Patents; R&D; ELECTRONICS,"This chapter provides an account of the development of the information technology (IT) and information technology-enabled services (ITES) in India. The IT sector was developed from the early 1960s, wherein only the government-owned companies were allowed to operate in this sector. In the later decades, the industry was opened to the private sector, both Indian and foreign. There is, however, no evidence that this open-door policy helped the IT industry to develop. In contrast, the ITES sector received a major boost when Indian private companies took advantage of the increasing demand for these services towards the end of the previous millennium. Subsequently, the ITES have expanded phenomenally, establishing India as one of the ITES powerhouses of the world. Although India's ITES sector was an unqualified success, there is not much evidence that this sector, or its hardware counterpart, contributed to indigenous technology development. India's R&D spending remained sluggish, which remains a major source of concern. A major uncertainty faced by the R&D system arose from India's patent regime. The amendment of India's patent law undertaken in the year 2000 to bring it in conformity with the TRIPS Agreement excludes computer programme per se from patenting. Initially, there was lack of clarity about the interpretation of the phrase. Later, the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, the authority responsible for implementing Patents Act, 1970, and the Judiciary have both provided a degree of clarity as to what computer programme per se really means.",2019,Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law
From a Means to an End: Patenting in the 1999 Danish 'Act on Inventions' and its Effect on Research Practice,Patenting; Commercialization of research; Intellectual property rights (IPR); Science policy; Goal displacement; Isomorphism; University performance contracts; OECD; Denmark; INDICATORS; KNOWLEDGE; INDUSTRY; UNIVERSITIES; PERFORMANCE; SCIENCE; EUROPE; IMPACT,"This paper examines the potential pitfalls for academic research associated with goal displacements in the implementation of goals and indicators of research commercialization. We ask why patenting has come to serve as the key policy indicator of innovative capacity and what consequences this has for the organization of academic research. To address these questions, the paper presents a case study from Denmark on, firstly, why and how the 1999 Danish 'Act on Inventions' introduced patenting as a central instrument to Danish science policy and, secondly, the effects the Act has had on Danish university organization and research practices. We trace why and how commercialization was introduced as an important objective in Danish science policy since the 1980s. The increased focus on patents is explained as an isomorphic adjustment to an international 'science policy field,' manifested in particular through OECD statistics, where patenting has come to serve as a key metric in international rankings. In a second step, we examine what effects the patenting requirements have had on organization and research practice at a Danish university. We show that in practice 'number of patents' changed from serving as an indicator of innovative capacity to being a policy goal in itself, thus in effect producing a goal displacement that is potentially damaging for both academic research and innovation capacity of the surrounding society. As a consequence of this goal displacement, active scientists now increasingly engage in patenting primarily as a means to fulfill organizational targets and to increase their 'fundability,' rather than to promote commercial applications of their research. In conclusion, we discuss how these unfulfilled policy ambitions have led to a retrospective redefinition of policy goals rather than an adjustment of the actual policy tools.",2018,Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics

TRIPS Implementation and Secondary Pharmaceutical Patenting in Brazil and India,Pharmaceuticals; Secondary patents; Section 3d; Prior Consent; TRIPS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; DRUG PATENTS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; LAW,"This article compares national approaches towards secondary pharmaceutical patents. Because secondary patents can extend periods of exclusivity and delay generic competition, they can raise prices and reduce access to medicines. Little is known about what measures and policies countries have enacted to address applications for secondary pharmaceutical patents, how they function, and whether, in practice, these measures limit secondary patents. We analyse the cases of India and Brazil. We assemble data on pharmaceutical patent applications filed in the two countries, code each application to identify which constitute secondary applications and examine outcomes for each application in both countries. The data indicate that Brazil is less likely to grant applications than India, but in both countries, the measures designed to limit secondary patents are having little direct effect. This suggests, on the one hand, that critics of these policies, such as the transnational pharmaceutical sector and foreign governments, may be more worried than they should be. On the other hand, champions of the policies, such as NGOs and international organizations, may have cause for concern that laws on the books are not having the expected impact on patent outcomes in practice. Our findings also suggest that, at the drug level, the effects of countries' approaches towards secondary patents need to be understood in the context of their broader approaches towards Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) implementation, including when and how they introduced pharmaceutical patents in the 1990s and 2000s.",2015,Development Studies; International Relations; Government & Law

Patent Pacifism,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; US PATENT; PRIVATE; TROLLS; RULES; COSTS; LAW; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; PARADOX,"Over the last decade, much of the patent law literature has focused on the problem of patent trolls, or patent owners who don't make products, but sue others that do. The basic complaint against these types of entities is that they impose a tax on innovation without providing offsetting societal benefits. Furthermore, their patent assertions have been on the rise, with a significant percentage of patent suits now attributable to them. In short, the troll phenomenon suggests a problem of excessive patent assertions. But despite the importance of the troll phenomenon, the fact remains that most patents are never asserted, or are asserted less than they could be. Under-assertion of patents thus appears to be more prevalent than over-assertion. Yet, beyond noting a set of generic economic considerations that may lead to this outcome, the literature fails to provide systematic, industry-specific assessments of why patent owners choose to forego asserting their rights in so many cases. And the generic nature of these assessments is particularly problematic given that patents play significantly different roles from one industry to the next, as scholars have noted for some time. This Article addresses these issues by providing an industry-specific, informal model for theorizing why patent owners forego asserting their rights in so many cases (and why they may not in others). It briefly applies this model to four industries: software, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and semiconductors. The Article then explores some potential implications of this industry specific model. In particular, this Article suggests that high barriers to patent assertion in an industry may, ironically, result in increased patent trolling in the industry. Hence, this Article provides guidance to policymakers by helping explain the rise of patent assertions in some industries, such as software, as well as helping to identify other industries, such as biotechnology, that may be increasingly at risk of patent trolling.",2017,Government & Law

To date, these US patents remain valid despite an increasing onslaught of challenges in court. However, recent precedents established in US courts significantly narrow the scope of patent eligibility within biotechnology.

Patent management by universities: evidence from Italian academic inventions,; BAYH-DOLE ACT; PROFESSORS PRIVILEGE; PROPENSITY SCORE; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; IMPACT; TECHNOLOGY; FACULTY; COMMERCIALIZATION; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE,"Over the past 20 years, European universities have increased their propensity to retain title of their faculty's inventions, but evidence on the value of such patents is at best mixed. Based on a longitudinal sample of Italian academic patents (patents over faculty's inventions), assigned either to universities or firms, we find that the lower value of university-owned patents, versus firm-owned ones, is owing to lower Technological Importance of the inventions and less effective Exploitation of the related patents. Lack of experience in managing patented inventions explains our results for Technological Importance, but not for Exploitation. Both are unrelated to the presence of a technology transfer office. Our study suggests caution in pushing universities to expand their patent portfolios and in using university-owned patents as indicators of technology-transfer activities.",2019,Business & Economics

Using a comprehensive dataset of university patents by 155 leading Chinese universities from 1991 to 2009, our study pursues two objectives: First, we analyze the quantity and quality of patents filed by leading Chinese universities. Second, we analyze the role of subsidy programs with regard to university patenting in China. With regard to the first objective, our results show that university patents witnessed rapid growth in terms of quantity while patent quality did not increase to a similar degree. Regarding the second objective, we find that a subsidy program to promote research excellence at selected universities is a significant driver of patent quantity and quality. In contrast, a subsidy program that decreases the costs of patent applications seems to enhance patent quantity but not patent quality. We conclude that innovation policies which aim to stimulate patents of higher quality should focus primarily on increasing university R&D, and to a lesser extent on decreasing the costs of university patenting.",2016,Engineering; Business & Economics
Determinants of external patenting behavior among university scientists,patenting; universities; technology transfer; technology transfer office; COMMERCIALIZATION; FACULTY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; MOTIVATIONS; ENGAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; ACADEMICS; INDUSTRY; SUCCESS; IMPACT,"Over the past 30 years, university patenting has grown dramatically as a result of the US Bayh-Dole Act (1980) and efforts among universities to encourage faculty to pursue intellectual property. Recent reviews of the literature show that university technology transfer is primarily conceptualized in terms a relatively linear process of disclosure, patenting, and licensing. While this is the general pattern for university patenting, many faculty inventions are also patented outside the university. Using data from a national survey of academic patenters, this paper estimates probit and negative binomial regression models to assess individual and organizational factors that contribute to patenting external to the traditional technology transfer process among university scientists. Findings indicate that external patenting is a function of the science, scientist's training, and the lack of a department culture of encouraging patenting via technology transfer offices.",2017,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration

In a simple model, we identify forces that lead firms to either suboptimally patent too early or too late in equilibrium, and we determine conditions so that stronger patents induce earlier or later equilibrium disclosure. Then, by solving an infinite multistage patent game with a more explicit structure, we describe innovation growth, and derive detailed predictions that can be used for policy experiments. As an application, we calibrate our multistage game using summary statistics from the seeds breeding industry. We find that weaker patent rights may result in welfare gains of 46% relative to the status quo. The gains are achieved because weaker patents reduce competition, thus leading firms to postpone patenting.",2016,Business & Economics
SUSTAINABLE USE OF GENETIC RESOURCES AND TRADITIONAL MEDICINAL KNOWLEDGE: INDONESIAN PERSPECTIVE ON UTILIZATION PRESERVATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF CULTURE,Genetic Resources; Traditional Medicinal Knowledge; National Medicine Patent Development; Collective Action; ,"Prof. James W. Black, 1988 Nobel Prize Winner of Medicine said: the most fruitful basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug, this statement shown significant roles of long existed traditional medicine as the prior art in medicine product development. Many modern drugs and vaccines are based on Genetic Resources (GR) and Traditional Medicinal Knowledge (TMK). Patent protection for medicines derived from GR processed with TMK have been major discussions and raised uptight antagonism between developing countries and developed countries. From economic view, the word herbal market continue to rise and estimated will reach US $ 150 billion by 2020. Despite the bio-diversity richness with at least 30.000 species of medicinal plants and the issuing of significant laws that potentially play significant roles in national medicine patent development, the statistical data of Indonesian Patent Office shows unfortunate irony in 2016 where domestic patent registration was only 1.440 comparing to 7.766 foreign patents, with 96 % on medicine registered patents were for foreign products. This paper will focus on the quest for intersection between proper utilization, strategic promotion and comprehensive protection of genetic resources and traditional medicinal knowledge according to national patent law and the law of advancement of culture. The result shows that the key points lies in improvement of normative legal framework and operation system by creating legal and functional platform to regulate and implementing proper utilization, strategic promotion and comprehensive preservation of GR and TMK sustainably and productively to escalate national medicine development that serve community empowerment, utility and economic growth..",2019,Government & Law
Compulsory Licensing and Anti-Evergreening: Interpreting the TRIPS Flexibilities in Sections 84 and 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act,; ,"During the last quarter of the twentieth century, India was known as the Pharmacy of the Developing World a critical source of inexpensive, life-saving drugs for the world's most impoverished populations. But when India joined the World Trade Organization in 1995, it became subject to the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS), which required it, among other things, to restore product patents on drugs by a certain date. India's 2005 Amendments to the Patents Act did just that, but also included a number of provisions-called TRIPS flexibilities-intended to lessen the blow regarding access to medicines. Two critical TRIPS flexibilities were (I) a compulsory licensing provision, which stipulated that public interest needs could compel brand-name pharmaceuticals to agree to license their patented drugs; and (2) an anti-evergreening provision which raised the bar for what pharmaceutical companies had to show to obtain a drug patent in the first place. The Amendments emphasized the purposes of these provisions: the compulsory licensing provision aimed at ensuring public health interacts were satisfied, while the anti-evergreening provision intended to eliminate wasteful efforts to maintain weak patents. In the two most important decisions interpreting the 2005 Amendments to the Patents Act to date, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board in Bayer v. Natco and the Supreme Court of India in Novartis AG v. Union of India sought to reinforce the fundamental rationale of these two key TRIPS flexibilities. Ultimately, however, Bayer and Novartis interpreted the two flexibilities in ways that may have weakened the principles they set out to bolster.",2015,Government & Law

RIGHT ON TIME: FIRST POSSESSION IN PROPERTY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,; ECONOMICS; PATENTS; NORMS,"How should we allocate property rights in unowned tangible and intangible resources? This Article develops a model of original acquisition that draws together common law doctrines of first possession with original acquisition doctrines in patent, copyright, and trademark law. The common denominator is time: in each context, doctrine involves a trade-off between assigning entitlements to resources earlier or later in the process of their development and use. Early awards risk granting exclusivity to parties who may not be capable of putting resources to their best use. Late awards prolong contests for ownership, which may generate waste or discourage acquisition efforts in the first place. While the doctrinal resolution of these timing questions varies in different resource contexts, the determination depends upon a recurring and discrete set of functional considerations. This Article applies its theory to assess a host of doctrinal features in our patent, copyright, and trademark laws, to analyze recent intellectual property law developments, and to suggest directions for reform.",2019,Government & Law
INVENTING AROUND COPYRIGHT,; ,"Patent law has long harbored the concept of inventing around, under which competitors to a patent holder may be expected, and even encouraged, to design their technologies so as to skirt the boundaries defined by patent claims. It has become increasingly clear that, for better or for worse, copyright also fosters inventing around. Copyright is not based on written claims, but because copyright links exclusive rights to technological actions such as reproduction, distribution, or transmission, the language of the copyright statute, and judicial readings of the statute, create boundaries around which potential infringers may technologically navigate. For example, the Aereo case recently decided by the Supreme Court involves technology that was explicitly designed to conform to noninfringing definitions of private transmission found in previous court decisions. But in copyright, unlike patent, there has been little analysis of the tendency to foster alternative technological development. This Essay draws upon previous analyses of inventing around in patent law to assess the benefits and detriments of inventing around in copyright.",2015,Government & Law

Patent Publication and the Market for Ideas,licensing; patent publication; invention disclosure; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INNOVATION; DISCLOSURE; IMPACT; SALE; US,"In this paper, we study the effect of invention disclosure through patent publication on the market for ideas. We do so by analyzing the effects of the American Inventor's Protection Act of 1999 (AIPA)-which required U.S. patent applications to be published 18 months after their filing date rather than at patent grant-on the timing of licensing deals in the biomedical industry. We find that post-AIPA U.S. patent applications are significantly more likely to be licensed before patent grant and shortly after 18-month publication. Licensing delays are reduced by about 10 months, on average, after AIPA's enactment. These findings suggest a hitherto unexplored benefit of the patent system: by requiring inventions to be published through a credible, standardized, and centralized repository, it mitigates information costs for buyers and sellers, and thus facilitates transactions in the market for ideas.",2018,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
Understanding Patent Privateering: A Quantitative Assessment,; ,"Since 2011, several papers and articles have speculated about the motivations, activities, and possible anti-competitive effects of hybrid patent assertion entities (PAEs) or, more pejoratively, patent privateers. Most prior work has assumed that privateers are essentially extorting money from firms by making weak infringement claims employing weak patents. Under a more classical law and economics approach, we would expect patent privateers to acquire valuable patents to reduce litigation risk and justify patent enforcement. However, to date, there has been no quantitative analysis on this form of patent holder to support or disprove either of these theoretical viewpoints. This article takes a first step toward filling that gap in the analysis by conducting an empirical assessment of patent lawsuits filed between 2010 and 2013. Although several studies have provided useful analysis on who litigates patents and which patents are more likely to be litigated, we add new variables and insights to the analysis. First, our dataset identifies the business models of the parties involved, including hybrid PAEs. Second, we include data on patent reassignments, which allows us to identify when a hybrid PAE takes (partial) possession of a patent. Third, for making comparisons between litigated and unlitigated patents, our dataset includes a set of unlitigated patents that match our litigated patent dataset on several key variables. In this work, we explore three interesting questions: (1) What patent characteristics predict a patent's acquisition by a hybrid PAE? (2) Do hybrid PAEs acquire patents that are more likely to be litigated? and (3) Does reassignment to a hybrid PAE affect the time when a patent is first asserted in litigation? We find that hybrid PAEs tend to acquire patents in the information technology, surgery, and medical instrument fields more often than patents in other technology areas. Hybrid PAEs also obtain relatively higher-quality patents than average, but objective quality metrics generally are on par when compared to patents litigated by firms with other business models. Our analysis also suggests that hybrid PAEs prefer patents with a broader scope of protection. Reassigning a patent to a hybrid PAE is generally associated with higher odds that the patents will be litigated. Finally, patents held by hybrid PAEs at some point in their lifespan experience their first litigation later than those never held by a hybrid PAE. In short, our analysis suggests that patent privateers appear to be focused on improving the possibility of successful patent monetization by focusing on acquiring higher-quality patents with a broader scope of protection, as value and scope are perceived by economists. This research is consistent with the law and economics theory that hybrid PAEs acquire valuable patents and not the extortion theory that they acquire weak patents.",2019,Government & Law

For the US semiconductor industry, a strengthening of the patent regime in the 1980s was followed by a sharp increase in patenting but had almost no impact on R&D expenditure. This paper attempts to understand this patent paradox by taking some of the industry features into account. We present a model of invention and product development in complex industries where product development involves putting together a large number of inventions and where licensing of patentable inventions is common. While a stronger patent regime leads to higher patenting in both in presence and absence of licensing, the positive relationship between patenting and R&D is weakened in presence of licensing since licensing provides an alternative way of accessing inventions. A stronger patent regime, therefore, may only create weak incentives to increase R&D, while strongly increasing patenting activities in such an industry.",2016,Business & Economics

The University of Chicago Law Review,; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; COMPUTER-PROGRAMS; PATENT; SOFTWARE; DOCTRINE; DESIGN,"Intellectual property regimes frequently employ boundary screens. Boundary screens protect the different balances of competition and protection that Congress has struck in the different regimes by preventing the goods whose protectability should be determined by one regime from infiltrating into and receiving protection under another regime. Prior scholarship on boundary screens offers in-depth analyses of the functionality screens in nonpatent intellectual property that avoid upsetting patent law's competition protection balance for functional innovation. This Article turns the table, asking a previously unasked question about how patent's authorship screen that is, its boundary screen that prevents infiltration by the authorial innovation that is the proper domain of copyright does and should work. Shortcomings in patent's authorship screen upset copyright's competition protection balance, allowing patents to function as abnormally thick backdoor copyrights, just as shortcomings in copyright's functionality screen allow copyrights to function as abnormally long and easy-to obtain backdoor patents. In addition to its normative assessment of the authorship screen's importance as a barrier to backdoor copyrights and its descriptive analysis of the statutorily diffuse set of patent doctrines that collectively enforce the authorship screen, this Article presents case studies focusing on architectural innovation, an unstudied zone of overlap on the copyright patent boundary that illustrates the authorship screen in action.",2017,Government & Law

Patent social networks are considered along several dimensions, including relative centrality, structural equivalence and brokerage roles. Identifying 19,385 software patents applications to the USPTO by 37 countries during 1995-2012, results show that firms positioned with a relative centrality or situated within the same structural equivalent cluster have more citations to their counterpart firms' patents. Further, among the different brokerage roles, we find positive promotion to knowledge transfer when the citing and cited firms both serve the role of an itinerant as well as that of a gatekeeper/representative, while firms that act as gatekeeper/representative (alone) cite less patents from firms that do not enact this kind of a role. These unique insights provide a better understanding of channels of knowledge transmission and have implications for the pace of technological change.",2019,Engineering; Business & Economics

We find that a proposed broadening of patent eligibility to include software in 2004 had a large positive effect on average returns for listed software companies in India. An unanticipated reversal of this proposed policy change in 2005 resulted in substantial negative returns. We illustrate substantial heterogeneity in the dynamics of these effects across the sequence of events. We also find smaller firms to have been systematically and most significantly affected by the tightening of patent law with regard to software patents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

PATENT ASSERTION ENTITIES AND EU COMPETITION LAW,; INNOVATION; ANTITRUST,"Patent assertion entities (PAEs) are playing an increasingly active role in Europe. Their activities are controversial in that although they may be a source of efficiencies, they may also create anticompetitive harm. Given the growing trend of operating companies transferring patents to PAEs to increase their licensing revenues, the risks of anticompetitive harm created by PAE activities must be taken seriously. When analyzing the impact of PAE activities on competition, a distinction must be drawn between pure PAEs, which acquire patents from a variety of sources and generate revenues by asserting them, and hybrid PAEs, which acquire patents from operating companies and maintain a relationship with these companies postacquisition. Although pure PAEs create risks of exploitation, hybrid PAEs create exclusionary concerns as such PAEs may be used by operating companies to harm their rivals on downstream product markets. These exclusionary concerns are particularly serious when the operating company retains a significant degree of control over the PAE's activities following the transfer of the patents. As there is currently no EU competition case-law on the activities of PAEs, this article attempts to show through hypotheticals that depending on the circumstances of each case, privateering may lead to exclusion.",2019,Business & Economics; Government & Law
"CERTIORARI, UNIVERSALITY, AND A PATENT PUZZLE",; SUPREME-COURT; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; LAW; AGENDA; EXCEPTIONALISM; PRECEDENT,"The most important determinant of a case's chances for Supreme Court review is a circuit split: If two courts of appeals have decided the same issue differently, review is substantially more likely. But practically every appeal in a patent case makes its way to a single court-the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. How, then, does the Supreme Court decide whether to grant certiorari in a patent case? The petitions for certiorari in the Court's patent docket suggest an answer: The Supreme Court looks for splits anyway. These splits, however, are of a different sort. Rather than consider whether two courts of appeals have decided the same issue differently, the Court looks to whether two fields of law conflict over the application of the same transsubstantive doctrine. Such field splits are unusual candidates for Supreme Court attention. After all, the Court's interest in circuit splits is motivated by a desire for geographic uniformity in federal law. But field splits, unlike circuit splits, do not give rise to forum shopping concerns, do not undermine the predictability of the law, nor otherwise implicate the legal values that counsel in favor of uniformity. Instead, the Supreme Court's attention to field splits may suggest that legal universality-consistency across substantive fields of law-is an important (but unstated) priority in certiorari decisionmaking. The exercise of this universality interest through certiorari decisions in patent cases has several consequences for the Supreme Court's agenda. The Court must better explain why field splits merit review, and we must better understand how to distinguish those field splits that implicate the Court's universality-related concerns from those that do not.",2018,Government & Law

THE LAW OF LOOK AND FEEL,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; DESIGN PROTECTION; COPYRIGHT; ECONOMICS; INNOVATION; PATENTS; SELF,"Design which encompasses everything from shape, color, and packaging to user interface, consumer experience, and brand aura is the currency of modern consumer culture and increasingly the subject of intellectual property claims. But the law of design is confused and confusing, splintered among various doctrines in copyright, trademark, and patent law. Indeed, while nearly every area of IP law protects design, the law has taken a siloed approach, with separate disciplines developing ad hoc rules and exceptions. To address this lack of coherence, this Article provides the first comprehensive assessment of the regulation of consumers' aesthetic experiences in copyright, trademark, and patent law what we call the law of look and feel. We canvas the diverse ways that parties have utilized (and stretched) intellectual property law to protect design in a broad range of products and services, from Pac-Man to Louboutin shoes to the iPhone. In so doing, we identify existing doctrines and principles that inform a normatively desirable law of look and feel that courts and Congress should extend throughout IP law's protection of design. We argue that design law should protect elements of look and feel but remain sensitive to eliminating or mitigating exclusive rights in response to evolving standardization, consumer expectations, and context. Notably, our normative conception of design protection sometimes departs quite starkly from how courts have expansively conceptualized look and feel as protectable subject matter. Going further, we argue that the new enclosure movement of design, if not comprehensively reformed and grounded in theory, can erode innovation, competition, and culture itself.",2017,Government & Law
The Procedure of Patent Eligibility,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; LAW; INNOVATION; JURIES,"A decade ago, the patent-eligible subject matter requirement was defunct. Several recent Supreme Court decisions, however, have made eligibility the most important issue in many patent cases. To date, debates over the resurgent doctrine have focused mainly on its substance. Critics contend that the Supreme Court's case law makes patents too easy to invalidate and discourages innovation. Supporters emphasize that the Court's decisions help eradicate the overly broad patents often asserted by so-called patent trolls. Yet one important consequence of eligibility 's revival has been procedural. Because district courts often view eligibility to present a pure question of law, they are-for the first time ever invalidating patents on motions to dismiss, ending infringement cases before the costly discovery process begins. The test for eligibility adopted by the Supreme Court, however, compares the claimed invention to the technology that predated the patent. That comparison, this Article argues, often involves disputes of fact, which means that courts should be more cautious about deciding eligibility on the pleadings than they currently are. In two noteworthy decisions issued in early 2018, the Federal Circuit held that the question of patent eligibility does indeed have factual underpinnings, brushing aside precedent that seemed to treat eligibility as a purely legal matter. But these new decisions may go too far. By making it extremely easy for plaintiffs to create a factual dispute that prevents pre-trial adjudication, they threaten to nullify what this Article identifies as a key policy function of the eligibility requirement: providing a means for courts to quickly and cheaply dismiss infringement claims so plainly lacking merit that discovery is unwarranted. In addition to examining the legal-versus-factual nature of eligibility doctrine, the Article analyzes several other important questions about procedure in eligibility cases that the lower federal courts-including judges and panels of the Federal Circuit-have answered in wildly divergent ways. Those questions range from the role of claim construction in the eligibility analysis, to the relevance of the statutory presumption of patent validity, to whether courts should decide eligibility when a case can be terminated on another ground. By engaging these vexing issues, the Article sketches a procedural framework for resolving eligibility that would allow courts to quickly invalidate bad patents while reducing the danger they will erroneously invalidate a good patent on an inadequately developed record.",2019,Government & Law

A ranking of the top-patenting universities shows a huge predominance of US universities: 18 of the top 25 universities are located in the US, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology being ranked first. Our results show that the propensity to apply for patents is very high among US and Asian universities, while European universities lag behind.

Understanding administrative agencies' functions in managing or directing, i.e., administrating, patent litigation sheds both descriptive and normative insight on several aspects of patent reform. These include several problems inherent in patent litigation generally, and ways of fixing them that focus less on the identities or characteristics of litigants and more on agencies' (and courts') institutional incentives.

Honour in UK Copyright Law is Not 'A Trim Reckoning' - Its Impact on the Integrity Right and the Destruction of Works of Art,copyright; moral rights; art; honour; anthropology; iniuria; ,"The meaning of 'honour' in section 80 of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 is not easily ascertained. There has been a tendency for academics and judges to either equate the concept of 'honour' with that of 'reputation', or to ignore its presence altogether. The author will propose that there is little to justify such treatment of this concept. This article offers a reinterpretation of the concept by analysis of anthropological theories of honour and of the Roman law of iniuria. By applying such reinterpretation, it is argued the concept of honour would play a far more significant role in articulating the integrity right under section 80 than previously envisaged. In particular, by interpreting 'honour' as a right to respect, it opens up the possibilities of recognising the artist's right to object to the destruction of their works, a right which is presently unrecognised in UK copyright law.",2016,Government & Law

Quantitative empirical trends in technical performance,Moore's Law; Power laws and experience curves; Forecasting; Performance trends; Quantitative; Empirical trends; PROGRESS; PATTERNS; CURVES,"Technological improvement trends such as Moore's law and experience curves have been widely used to understand how technologies change over time and to forecast the future through extrapolation. Such studies can also potentially provide a deeper understanding of R&D management and strategic issues associated with technical change. However, such uses of technical performance trends require further consideration of the relationships among possible independent variables in particular between time and possible effort variables such as cumulative production, R&D spending, and patent production. The paper addresses this issue by analyzing performance trends and patent output over time for 28 technological domains. In addition to patent output, production and revenue data are analyzed for the integrated circuits domain. The key findings are: 1. Sahal's equation is verified for additional effort variables (for patents and revenue in addition to cumulative production where it was first developed). 2. Sahal's equation is quite accurate when all three relationships (a) an exponential between performance and time, (b) an exponential between effort and time, (c) a power law between performance and the effort variable have good data fits (r(2) > 0.7). 3. The power law and effort exponents determined are dependent upon the choice of effort variable but the time dependent exponent is not. 4. All 28 domains have high quality fits (r(2) > 0.7) between the log of performance and time whereas 9 domains have very low quality (r(2) < 0.5) for power law fits with patents as the effort variable. 5. Even with the highest quality fits (r(2) > 0.9), the exponential relationship is not perfect and it is thus best to consider these relationships as the foundation upon which more complex (but nearly exponential) relationships are based. Overall, the results are interpreted as indicating that Moore's law is a better description of longer-term technological change when the performance data come from various designs whereas experience curves may be more relevant when a singular design in a given factory is considered.

However, not all qualified researchers sought to be involved in patenting. We compared researchers' human capital and their perceptions of resource availability on patent applications. We collected primary data from biomedical principal investigators from 15 universities using a validated questionnaire. Our results from logistic regression strongly suggest that human capital had a stronger influence than perceptions of resource availability for commercialization activities on patent applications. The policy implications are that universities should seek to enhance the stock of human capital most associated with patenting behaviors to improve academic entrepreneurial outcomes.",2019,Engineering; Business & Economics
The link between technology transfer and international extension of university patents: Evidence from Spain,university patenting; internationalisation; patent families; licensing; Spain; INNOVATION; INVENTION; QUALITY; ACT,"The aim of this article is to shed light on the decision-making process at university technology transfer offices and show that the last steps in the process of international patent extension, when costs step up, tend to be only taken conditional on the existence of a licensing agreement. This information has so far been underexploited by policymakers and innovation scholars in search of innovation indicators. We argue that the number of international patent families filed by a university can be used as a rough indicator of technology transfer activity mediated through patents, especially in the context of tight public university budgets and national patent systems with fee reductions for universities. To support our argument, we review qualitative information from interviews at technology transfer offices, regulations, and internal statutes from a selection of Spanish universities and present a statistical analysis of the relation between patent internationalisation and licensing.",2018,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration
Compulsory licensing and innovation - Historical evidence from German patents after WWI,Innovation; Patents; Compulsory licensing; TRIPS; Intellectual property; Economic history; COMPETITION; COUNTRIES; INDIA,"Compulsory licensing allows governments to license patented inventions without the consent of patent owners. Intended to mitigate the potential welfare losses from enforcing foreign-owned patents, many developing countries use this policy to improve access to drugs that are covered by foreign -owned patents. The effects of compulsory licensing on access to new drugs, however, are theoretically ambiguous: Compulsory licensing may encourage innovation by increasing competition or discourage innovation by reducing expected returns to R& D. Empirical evidence is rare, primarily because contemporary settings offer little exogenous variation in compulsory licensing. We address this empirical challenge by exploiting an event of compulsory licensing as a result of World War I when the US Trading with the Enemy Act made all German -owned patents available for licensing to US firms. Firm-level data on German patents indicate that compulsory licensing was associated with a 30 percent increase in invention by German firms whose inventions were licensed.",2017,Business & Economics
University invention and the abolishment of the professor's privilege in Finland,Academic patenting; Finland; Professor's privilege; University ownership; ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS; EUROPE; ACT,"In 2007 Finland changed ownership rights to inventions from its employees - the professor's privilege - to universities. We investigate how this change affected academic patenting using new data on inventors and patenting in Finland for the period 1995-2010. Matched sample panel data regressions using difference-in-differences show that patenting by individuals dropped by at least 29 percent after 2007. Unlike other countries studied, in Finland the reform was known before implementation. Adding the period after announcement to the reform period increases the drop in academic patenting to 46 percent. Our and others' results call into question whether the European reform of the professor's privilege were good innovation policy.",2018,Business & Economics
Harmony and Disharmony in International Intellectual Property Law,; PATENT; SYSTEM,"Global trade agreements aim to harmonize standards and create a uniform climate for trade and investment. As potential provisions are negotiated, governments and stakeholders must consider the long-term impacts of particular terms. As they do so, they should keep in mind that harmonized treaty standards often translate into significantly disharmonious country standards, due to the different ways in which countries comply with treaties, translate these treaties into laws, and administer the laws. This chapter provides a case study of the harmony and disharmony in substantive patent law that followed ratification of the TRIPS agreement. Using the (perhaps) moribund Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement as a point of comparison to TRIPS, the author discusses and provides examples of three types of differences: (1) differences between the minimum standards that are negotiated and compliance with them; (2) differences between the substantive principles agreed to and the actual laws that implement them (and the procedural contexts in which they operate); and (3) differences between the laws on the books and the laws as administered.",2018,Business & Economics; International Relations
The limits of ordre public and morality for the patentability of human embryonic stem cell inventions,hESC inventions; ordre public and morality; patent law; ,"Inventions involving human embryonic stem cells (hESC) have unprecedented potential to improve human life through discovery of new drugs and treatment of incurable neurodegenerative diseases, but at the same time, the use of human embryos in research gives rise to contrasting ethical, moral and religious views on the patentability of such inventions. Whether and to what extent patent offices should take these views into account is an open question. The ordre public and morality clause in patent law may help us find an answer, but neither the legislator nor courts have clarified the meaning of these vague terms. Judicial interpretation has sometimes increased their ambiguity and raised legal uncertainty for the patentability of hESC inventions. This situation may be desirable in some cases, but not in others where the principles of the legal system as a whole come into play. This paper will shed light on the meaning of ordre public and morality for hESC inventions by examining patent law in the broader legal framework and emphasizing the interconnectedness of national legal systems in a global market as well as the common interest in healthcare innovations.",2019,Government & Law
MUCH ADO ABOUT HOLD-UP,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PATENT HOLDUP; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF; ROYALTY STACKING; ANTITRUST-LAW; STANDARDS; REMEDIES,"The policy debate surrounding patent hold-up in markets for standardized products is well into its second decade with no end in sight. Fundamental questions, including the definition of hold-up, the extent to which it exists in the marketplace, and the impact it has on innovation, continue to bedevil scholars, policy makers, and industry. Yet it is not clear that this debate needs to continue. Patent hold-up is a form of market behavior, not a legal cause of action. Whether hold-up is commonplace or rare is largely irrelevant to liability in any given case. To the extent that hold-up behavior constitutes an abuse of market power, with resulting harms to competition, longstanding doctrines of antitrust and competition law exist to sanction it. To the extent that hold-up impedes the efficient operation of standard-setting processes, standards development organizations can, and have, adopted internal procedures, including disclosure and licensing requirements, to curtail that behavior. Thus, the ongoing debate over the empirical evidence for systemic patent hold-up in standardized product markets, or a lack thereof, seems a fruitless academic exercise. The presence or absence of systemic hold-up actually tells us little about individual firm behavior that can and should be sanctioned by the law, and it may thus be time to close the debate over the systemic prevalence of patent hold-up.",2019,Government & Law

Comparative less attention is typically given to the assessment of their involvement in patenting. When this is done, the established practice is further to evaluate productivity using simple patent counts. This article argues the relevance of using more sophisticated measures of patenting activity, as part of assessments of scientific productivity. Specifically, patent survival analysis is applied on a sample of patent applications originating from Sweden's largest medical university. This analysis finds that patent lifespan is correlated to patent, inventor, and assignee characteristics. These results indicate that patent survival analysis could offer a more information-dense representation of a university's invention efforts longitudinally and therefore, add a qualitative dimension to the evaluation of academic research. This has potential implications for how universities involved in patenting and commercialization undertake internal evaluations, and how governmental bodies and/or other third-party financiers and policymakers design external performance assessment criteria. The results also point to the potential of combining legal status data with insights from academic inventors and patent owners to support funding bodies and university managers in resource allocation and for benchmarking purposes.",2015,Information Science & Library Science
THE CENTRAL CLAIMING RENAISSANCE,; PATENTABLE SUBJECT-MATTER; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; RETHINKING; RULES; PRESUMPTION; STANDARDS; JUSTICE; MYRIAD; RETURN; COURT,"The Supreme Court has recently reinvigorated the law of patentable subject matter. But beneath the headlines proclaiming the return of limits to patent eligibility, a more profound shift has taken place: central claiming is reborn. The Court's eligibility cases are significant outliers compared to today's run-of-the-mill patent law because claim language plays little role in their analyses. In our modern peripheral claiming system, the claim language is the near-exclusive guide to the patent's boundaries. But in its earliest days, our patent system pursued a central claiming approach, in which the inventor's actual work determined the patent's scope. The Court's eligibility cases focus on the inventor's actual contribution to the field, precisely as a central claiming inquiry would. And they can be better understood once this return to central claiming is revealed. Indeed, the shift to central claiming points the way toward a principled approach to eligibility. The eligibility requirement aims to prevent patents from covering certain kinds of prohibited subject matter: laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. But every invention, at some level of abstraction, applies ineligible subject matter. In a peripheral claiming system, this levels-of-abstraction problem could lead courts to simply deem all claims eligible (as occurred for nearly thirty years) or all claims ineligible (as some fear will happen today). Central claiming offers a solution by focusing on what the inventor added to the storehouse of knowledge. It is that contribution, rather than some abstraction from the claim language, that guides the eligibility analysis. There are several additional payoffs to uncovering the Court's return to central claiming. It helps make sense of the Court's eligibility jurisprudence, revealing two distinct threads in the cases-one focusing on ineligible contributions and another on implausible contributions-with distinct (though uneasy) normative foundations. More robust use of central claiming might also improve other areas of patent law. As a proof of concept, I show that it could provide a better approach to the exhaustion trigger, improve the law of divided infringement, and rehabilitate the written description requirement. These examples illustrate the potential of the central claiming renaissance.",2018,Government & Law
Patenting nature-a comparative perspective,Patent eligibility; nucleotide sequences; BRCA; Myriad; Mayo; USA; Australia; GENE PATENTS; LAW; INNOVATION,"The landscape for patenting products and processes tied to the natural world has changed dramatically in recent times as a result of a series of decisions of the US Supreme Court, particularly Mayo Collaborative Services v Prometheus Laboratories 566 U.S. 66 (2012) and Association for Molecular Pathology v Myriad Genetics, Inc. 569 U.S. 576 (2013) (Myriad). This article critically analyses these decisions and the multitude of lower court decisions that have followed them. This analysis provides support for the growing concern in the United States that it will be increasingly difficult to use the patent system to encourage the development of therapies and research intermediates useful in developing new therapeutic interventions. One option being posited in the industry to deal with this problem is to lobby Congress to reform the threshold patent eligibility standard in US patent law. It is argued in this paper that a more nuanced approach is preferable. Using the experience in Australia as a case study, this paper argues that such an approach is feasible. Australia has been chosen for analysis because the threshold patent eligibility standard is similar in both countries, much more so that with the European Union, and because the highest court in Australia has ruled on essentially the same patent as in Myriad, in D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics, Inc [2015] HCA 35. In addition to the nuanced approach to eligibility currently exercised by the Australian courts and patent office, Australia also has a number of post-grant options for addressing the dynamics of patent monopolies. These include experimental use, compulsory licensing, and government use. It is concluded that, while it would be impractical to attempt to replicate the Australian environment in the United States, there is no reason why some lessons can't be learned from the Australian experience with patenting nature.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine

Inventions and Patents: A Practical Tutorial,Disclosure; Discovery; Invention; Intellectual property; Licensing; Nondisclosure agreement; Patent; Technology transfer; BIOSIMILARS,"Patents are designed to protect and encourage creativity and innovation. Patenting a biomedical discovery can be a requirement before a pharmaceutical company or biotech entity will invest in the lengthy and capital-intensive drug development and clinical trials necessary to achieve patient benefit. Although scientists and clinicians are well versed in research publication requirements, patent descriptions and claims are formatted in a manner quite different from a research paper. Patents require (a) a series of logical statements clearly delineating the boundaries of the novel aspects of the invention and (b) sufficient disclosure of the invention so that it can be reproduced by others. Patents are granted only for inventions that meet three conditions: novelty, non-obviousness, and usefulness. Recent changes to US patent law limit the scope of patentable material. Products of nature such as nucleic acids and proteins, or steps used to observe natural events, are no longer patent eligible. This chapter provides basic guidelines and definitions for inventions, inventorship, and patent filing which are summarized using a question and answer format.",2017,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine

Accusations of biopiracy, meaning the misappropriation and patenting of genetic resources and knowledge without consent, have-taken centre stage, leading to a reassessment of the conditions under which rooibos is traded. Claiming to be the primary holders of traditional knowledge relating to rooibos, indigenous San and Khoi have also launched demands-to date unmet-for a stake in rooibos benefits. Meanwhile, small-scale coloured rooibos producers, despite their involvement in fair trade, remain marginalized. All remain embedded in a political history of rooibos that is characterized by dispossession and adversity, having been propped up by the South African apartheid system. The melding of these issues with a complex and ambiguous legal framework has led to a situation described by some as the mother and testing ground of so-called access and benefit sharing. Such approaches stem in part from the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Nagoya Protocol, which lay down new and more equitable ways of treating trade in genetic resources and the use of traditional knowledge. With growing international interest in rooibos tea and its bioactive compounds, a surge of patents associated with the plant, the successful granting of geographical indication status, and threats to the industry of changing climates, ecologies and ecosystems, the stage is set for a reconceptualization and transformation of the industry. Drawing on longitudinal research over the past 20 years, this review paper aims to bring conceptual clarity and a holistic analysis to an often emotional, divided and, to date, narrowly framed debate. Through exploration of rooibos histories and traditional knowledge claims, bioprospecting and patent activities, and conservation imperatives, this paper reviews the spectrum of issues that require attention when considering access and benefit sharing in the rooibos industry and provides suggestions for a more integrative, environmentally responsive and just approach.

A technology patent database was collected with backward and forward citation patents currently registered in the US Patents and Trademark Office and identified by the Cooperative Patent Classification. Technology citation networks interact and follow the power law distribution. The analysis of individual patent characteristics and intermediaries revealed digital data processing and telemetry systems as core technology fields stimulating innovative BIM technology. This study overcomes the limitations of previous methods of technology forecasting that have depended on expert opinion or peer review by performing a patent big data analysis to ascertain the domain of the BIM industry. This approach could soon be applied to R&D strategy planning and competition in business and the development of cutting-edge technology.,2018,Construction & Building Technology; Engineering

In particular, I look at how that construction takes place in adversarial settings like the courts of law. I argue that key notions of intellectual property law like invention and inventorship are as constructed as technoscientific claims are in laboratories. Courts should thus be seen as sites of construction through processes framed by specific discursive and evidentiary technologies like bureaucratic paperwork, literary technologies, historiographic accounts of inventorship, and models of artifacts and devices. I draw my examples from the British disputes of the Marconi Company concerning the patenting of wireless telegraph and radio communication technologies in the first half of the twentieth century.

Effects of patent policy on innovation outputs and commercialization: evidence from universities in China,Patent policy; Universities; Outputs; Commercialization; BAYH-DOLE ACT; US UNIVERSITIES; PUBLIC-POLICY; IMPACT,"As the important source of scientific and technological innovation in China, the improvement of productivity from the patent commercialization in universities and research institutes is of great significance to the promotion of China's sustainable economic development. Despite the quantity of patent applications from universities has increased dramatically in recent years, the rate of patent commercialization is somewhat lower than we expect. The purpose of our study is to examine whether the incentive patent policy has effectively enhanced the patent outputs and commercialization of universities in China. We determine the specific patent policy based on the information collection and measure the specific effect of the patent policy by using the data of the 64 universities that were directly under the Ministry of Education from 2009 to 2015. As a result, we find that although the policy has increased a university's patent output, it does not encourage the patent's commercialization. This is because to a certain extent, the policy has a negative impact on the enthusiasm of the university patent commercialization. Therefore, we argue that patent policies focusing on the quantity in the short term can improve the innovation output but will have a negative impact on university's sustainable development in the long run.",2018,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science
Biosimilars and the Patent Law,Biopharmaceuticals; Biologic Medicinal Product; IP Exclusive Rights; Innovation; Intellectual Property; FUTURE,"Biopharmaceuticals are one of the most important recent medical innovations which revolutionised many areas of medicine. Dynamic development of the market for biopharmaceuticals in recent years is related to the expiration of the IP exclusive rights on original innovative biological medicinal products.

One of the greatest challenges concerning the emergence of biosimilars is modifying the law to ensure balance between the market development of biosimilars and access of patients to biological therapy. The development of biopharmaceutical inventions works hand in hand with the patent system. It should be underlined that IP rights in the biopharmaceutical sector are crucial for promoting innovation due to the very long time of product development. It is exactly the area in which patents make sense to fill the gap between innovation and the risk of imitation. However, the existing patent system is too expensive and slow for biotechnology development. It should be further adapted to the needs of biopharmaceuticals.",2019,Government & Law

Indeed, a variety of administrative actors influence patent policy through the exercise of their regulatory authority and administrative power. This Article offers a novel description of the ways in which nonpatent agencies intervene into patent policy. In particular, it examines agency responses to conflicts between patent and other regulatory aims, uncovering a relative preference for complacency (inaction) and resort to outside help (indirect action) over regulation (direct action). This dynamic has the striking effect of shifting authority from nonpatent agencies to patent policymakers, thereby supplanting some regulatory designs with the patent regime's more general incentives. This Article thus offers agencies new options for facing patent conflict, including an oft-overlooked theory of regulatory authority for patent-related regulation. Such intervention and regulation by nonpatent agencies can give rise to a more efficient and context-sensitive regime that is better aligned with other regulatory goals.",2015,Government & Law
An Analysis of Technologically Radical Innovation and Breakthrough Patents,Breakthrough; Innovation; Radicalness; Technology; Patents; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; BAYH-DOLE ACT; INTERACTION TERMS; VALUE-CREATION; QUALITY; IMPACT; INVENTIONS; OWNERSHIP; INVENTORS; PATTERNS,"Breakthrough innovations - commonly defined by innovations with patents surpassing a critical threshold of forward citations generate benefits for innovators, businesses, and society. Analyzing more than five million patents and citations from 1976 to 2017, this paper adds to the existing literature by examining whether the radicalness of a patented good - that is, the more technology classes cited as contributing prior arts not identified in the patent's own technology identity - impacts the likelihood an innovation is a breakthrough. In essence, the paper tests the common belief that it is beneficial to think outside the box when innovating. The results show that increased radicalness increases the likelihood of a breakthrough up to a certain threshold, after which increased radicalness decreases the likelihood of a breakthrough. Additionally, established innovators and university ownership of a patent each extend the range for which increased radicalness increases the probability of a breakthrough, while joint patent ownership decreases the range.",2019,Business & Economics
Knowledge Creates Markets: The influence of entrepreneurial support and patent rights on academic entrepreneurship,Intellectual property; Patents; Technology transfer; Policy evaluation; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER OFFICES; RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY; UNIVERSITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP; LIFE-CYCLE; ILLUSTRATION; RESOURCES; SCIENCE; UK,"We use an exogenous change in German Federal law to examine how entrepreneurial support and the ownership of patent rights influence academic entrepreneurship. In 2002, the German Federal Government enacted a major reform called Knowledge Creates Markets that set up new infrastructure to facilitate university-industry technology transfer and shifted the ownership of patent rights from university researchers to their universities. Based on a novel researcher-level panel database that includes a control group not affected by the policy change, we find no evidence that the new infrastructure resulted in an increase in start-up companies by university researchers. The shift in patent rights may have strengthened the relationship between patents on university-discovered inventions and university start-ups; however, it substantially decreased the volume of patents with the largest decrease taking place in faculty-firm patenting relationships.

Why and how do firms perform open innovation? Firms' open innovation is measured through the levels of firms' joint patent applications. Next, we analyze network structures and characters of firms' joint patent applications such as betweenness and degree centrality, structure hole, and closure. From this research, we drew conclusions as follows. First, the structure of collaboration networks has both direct and indirect effects on firms' innovative performance. Second, in the process of joint patent applications, there is a long tail phenomenon in networks of joint patent applications. Third, the number of patents and International Patent Classification (IPC) subclasses together constitute a meaningful measure of the innovation performance of firms.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
PTO Panel Stacking: Unblessed by the Federal Circuit and Likely Unlawful,; ELDRIDGE,"In recent years, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) sought to control results in adjudication by its Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB) through a process commonly described as panel stacking. In a strong form of this practice, the PTO Director or Director's delegee generated a new panel of administrative judges to conduct rehearing proceedings after an initial panel produced a decision with which the Director or delegee disagreed. This Essay contends that this strong-form practice raises constitutional concerns under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Consequently, the doctrine of constitutional avoidance instructs that courts should understand the Patent Act to preclude strong-form panel stacking. Judges and commentators have repeatedly erred by citing a plurality opinion on panel stacking in In re Alappat as if the plurality opinion authoritatively held that the Patent Act authorizes panel stacking. This Essay seeks to correct that misconception and shows that, once one takes account of constitutional concerns, the Alappat judges' recognition of statutory ambiguity effectively condemns strong-form panel stacking, rather than blessing it.",2019,Government & Law
Patentability of Self-Replicating Technologies,; ,"Patents provide an incentive to inventors, investors, and entrepreneurs to conduct research and development, especially in risky (i.e., unpredictable) fields of technology. This review discusses whether self-replicating technologies are patentable within the United States and the issues surrounding them. Self-replicating technologies discussed include plants, bacteria, and genetic technology and the historical legal precedents that have led to the current status of the patent law. To clearly understand these issues, the review also discusses various U.S. Supreme Court cases that, although not related to self-replicating technologies, have an impact on these patentability issues. Finally, some thoughts regarding patent strategy are presented so as to maximize patent protection for these technologies.",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine
BIOLOGICS: THE NEW ANTITRUST FRONTIER,; PRICE-COMPETITION; INNOVATION ACT; EXCLUSIONARY CONDUCT; TRADE SECRETS,"The pharmaceutical industry lies at the intersection of patent law, antitrust law, federal and state regulations, and complex markets. For the past several decades, courts and commentators have analyzed issues presented by brand-name and generic drug companies in the small molecule setting. But just as they have begun to comprehend the multiple moving parts, a new frontier has arisen involving large molecules known as biologics. Biologics differ from small-molecule drugs along multiple axes. They are more expensive, costing hundreds of millions of dollars to develop. They cannot be precisely replicated, followed by biosimilars rather than generics. They are governed not by the Hatch-Waxman Act but by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. And they present a blank slate on which issues of innovation and competition will be hammered out in the decades to come. Given that biologics promise revolutionary advances like treatments for previously incurable diseases and cancer regimens offering substantial benefits over chemotherapy, the stakes could not be higher. The small-molecule setting has been replete with collusive behavior such as reverse payment agreements by which brands and generics settle patent litigation and unilateral conduct by which brands modify their drugs to block generics, file frivolous government petitions, manipulate the regulatory regime, and deny materials generics need to enter the market. How likely are these (or other) forms of conduct to appear in the biologics industry? And if these behaviors occur, how should antitrust law respond? This Article addresses these questions, offering an antitrust framework for the conduct most likely to arise. In particular, it concludes that in the biologics setting, citizen petitions, the disparagement of bio-similars, and collusion between biologics and biosimilars will be more frequent and that product hopping and reverse-payment settlements will be less typical. This Article also recommends utilizing an antitrust analysis similar to what courts have applied in the small-molecule setting and applying a modestly more deferential analysis for citizen petitions. Antitrust finds itself at a unique and crucial moment: poised at the precipice of a new industry but able to draw on decades of case law in an analogous setting that has addressed issues of competition and innovation. It is far from obvious how much courts can-or should-take from that setting. This Article assists in this task by determining which antitrust principles and doctrines should be exported to the biologics setting while appreciating the differences that counsel against such extrapolation. Given the importance of life-saving cancer treatments and an impending $400 billion market, there is no time to waste.",2018,Government & Law
A FREE BITE AT THE APPLE: HOW FLAWED STATUTORY DRAFTING HAS UNDERMINED THE PURPOSE OF THE PATENT TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD,; ,"In the years before Congress passed the America Invents Act, patent litigation became exorbitantly expensive. Congress created three types of proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), which were intended to provide a cheaper and more cost-effective alternative to district court litigation over patent validity. A major factor in ensuring that the PTAB proceedings effectively substituted for district court litigation was a harsh estoppel provision that prevented any petitioner from relitigating any issue which was raised or reasonably could have been raised during the PTAB proceeding. The Federal Circuit, however, recently applied a narrow interpretation to the estoppel provision which jeopardizes the ability of PTAB proceedings to replace district court litigation. While it would be easy to place all the blame on the Federal Circuit for defanging the estoppel provision, this Note argues that the failure of PTAB proceedings to substitute for district court litigation ultimately stems from poor drafting within the America Invents Act. The combination of broad Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) substantive rulemaking power, unreviewable PTAB decisions to institute, and a sweeping estoppel provision doomed PTAB proceedings to failure. This Note offers that Congress must update the language of the statute itself in order to effectively address the issues presented by this combination.",2018,Government & Law
The process of intellectual property law reform in China,intellectual property law; legislature process; competent administrative agencies; State Council; Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; ,"In China, to enact or amend an intellectual property law, such as the Copyright Law, the Patent Law, the Trademark Law or the Unfair Competition Law is a complicated process, involving a number of competent administrations, the State Council, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Generally speaking, there are three steps to enacting or amending an intellectual property law. First, a competent administration, such as the National Copyright Administration (in charge of the Copyright Law), the State Intellectual Property Office (in charge of the Patent Law), or the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (in charge of the Trademark Law and the Unfair Competition Law), shall draft a law or amendment on the basis of their views. Secondly, the State Council shall develop its law or amendment on the basis of the drafting submitted by a competent agency and the suggestions or opinions of other administrative agencies. Thirdly, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress shall review the drafted law or amendment by the State Council three times, making some necessary changes on the basis of its views, and then pass the law or amendment. Although the consensuses will be gathered by these three steps, it is time-consuming to pass or amend a law, taking about eight to ten years.",2018,Government & Law
Permanent Injunctions in Patent Litigation After eBay: An Empirical Study,; PROPERTY RULES; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LIABILITY RULES; ROYALTY STACKING; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; INFRINGEMENT; TROLLS; HOLDUP; RELIEF; LAW,"The Supreme Court's 2006 decision in eBay v. MercExchange is widely regarded as one of the most important patent law rulings of the past decade. Historically, patent holders who won on the merits in litigation nearly always obtained a permanent injunction against infringers. In eBay, the Court unanimously rejected the general rule that a prevailing patentee is entitled to an injunction, instead holding that lower courts must apply a four-factor test before granting such relief Ten years later, however, significant questions remain regarding how this four-factor test is being applied, as there has been little rigorous empirical examination of eBay's actual impact in patent litigation. This Article helps fill this gap in the literature by reporting the results of an original empirical study of contested permanent injunction decisions in district courts for a 7.5-year period following eBay. It finds that eBay has effectively created a bifurcated regime for patent remedies, as operating companies who compete against an infringer still obtain permanent injunctions in the vast majority of cases that are successfully litigated to judgment. In contrast, non-competitors and other non-practicing entities are generally denied injunctive relief These findings are robust even after controlling for the field of patented technology and the particular court that decided the injunction request. This Article also finds that permanent injunction rates vary significantly based on patented technology and forum. Finally, this Article considers some implications of these findings for both participants in the patent system and policy makers.",2016,Government & Law
FORUM SELLING,; STATE COMPETITION; PATENT; EFFICIENCY; JUDGMENT; JUDGES; COURT; SHOP; LAW,"Forum shopping is problematic because it may lead to forum selling. For diverse motives, including prestige, local benefits, or re-election, some judges want to hear more cases. When plaintiffs have wide choice of forum, such judges have incentives to make the law more pro plaintiff because plaintiffs choose the court. While only a few judges may be motivated to attract more cases, their actions can have large effects because their courts will attract a disproportionate share of cases. For example, judges in the Eastern District of Texas have attracted patent plaintiffs to their district by distorting the rules and practices relating to case assignment, joinder, discovery, transfer, and summary judgment. As a result of these efforts, more than a quarter of all patent infringement suits were filed in the Eastern District of Texas in 2014. Consideration of forum selling helps justify constitutional constraints on personal jurisdiction. Without constitutional limits on jurisdiction, some courts are likely to be biased in favor of plaintiffs' in order to attract litigation. This Article explores forum selling through five case studies: patent litigation in the Eastern District of Texas and elsewhere; class actions and mass torts in magnet jurisdictions such as Madison County, Illinois; bankruptcy and the District of Delaware; ICANN domain name arbitration; and common law judging in early modern England.",2016,Government & Law

European Patent Reforms: Transforming European Patent Governance and Enhancing Collaborative Innovation?,Collaborative innovation; dynamic governance; European Union; governance; patent law; patent reforms; unitary patent; SYSTEM,"The main objective of the current chapter is to examine to what extent the European patent system, the decision-making process on the so-called Patent Package and its implementation reflect the conceptual framework of dynamic governance, a framework which aligns closely with the notion of collaborative innovation. In the global patent context, a gradual increase of more dynamic patent governance has been observed. The adoption of fundamental patent reforms in Europe calls for a review of those reforms from a dynamic governance perspective. After decades of negotiations on the European Union (EU) patent, the financial crisis has finally driven the EU Member States and the EU institutions to gain the momentum and to adopt a compromise on the Patent Package. These reforms are aimed at simplifying the European patent system, lowering the costs of patenting, improving legal certainty and limiting forum-shopping in terms of litigation. These objectives were supported widely by stakeholders. However, despite these laudable objectives, the way the decision-making process was spun out and then suddenly rushed through and the actual content of the package are highly controversial. In the end, the reforms will further increase the complexity of the European patent system, patent protection in Europe will probably remain rather expensive and the risk of forum shopping may continue to persist to a certain extent. This raises the fundamental question whether stakeholders have actually been sufficiently involved in the decision-making process.",2015,Area Studies; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics
PAY THE TROLL TOLL: THE PATENT TROLL MODEL IS FUNDAMENTALLY AT ODDS WITH THE PATENT SYSTEM'S GOALS OF INNOVATION AND COMPETITION,; ,"Patent litigation has multiplied sixfold since the 1980s, with the last few years seeing an unprecedented number of patent lawsuits. When an inventor receives a patent, the U.S. Constitution grants him a monopoly for a limited number of years to reward him for his investment of time and resources and to incentivize him to continue innovating, which ultimately benefits society. However, the emergence of a litigious character, deemed the patent troll, has led to the patent system's hindrance of innovation, a result that is at odds with the primary goal of patent law. Patent trolls exploit weaknesses in the patent system in a number of manners: they assert overly broad patents to force companies into financial settlements because these companies cannot afford the cost of litigation; they deter innovative companies from investing in research and development through the threat of litigation; and they do not practice the patents they hold, thus contributing no innovation in the advancement of technology and immunizing themselves from countersuit. In addition, trolls exhibit anticompetitive behavior, a trend that has caught the eye of the Federal Trade Commission. This Note provides a survey of the modern patent landscape, addressing certain areas of the patent system that patent trolls are able to use to their advantage. This Note then advocates that the Federal Trade Commission play a more integral role in curbing anticompetitive troll behavior and proposes several methods of patent reform.",2015,Government & Law

The solution is not to make small, thoughtful improvements at the edges; the solution instead is to recognize that, in this setting, government funding, prize systems, and other innovation-producing mechanisms should fully displace the normally attractive market-based patent regime.",2018,Government & Law
Inadvertent disclosures of inventions in social media affecting patent rights,Law; Intellectual property; Patents; Social media; Inadvertent disclosures; ,"Patents allow owners to control the commercial exploitation of their inventions. This is particularly important when the invention has significant commercial value. Inventors are likely to be careful about sharing confidential information about the invention during the developmental stage. People are often less careful about sharing information on social media as this is perceived as a social platform. Inadvertent disclosures about inventions on social media, however, can result in subsequent patent applications being rejected.

The Economic Theory of Patent Protection and Pandemic Influenza Vaccines: Do Patents Really Incentivize Innovation in the Field?,; GLOBAL PRODUCTION; TRADE AGREEMENTS; PROPERTY RULES; ACCESS; PREPAREDNESS; VACCINATION; BIOSIMILARS; COMPETITION; MEDICINES; HEALTH,"The creation of new vaccines is one of the key challenges in the battle against global infectious diseases. Therefore, creating the optimal conditions for innovation in vaccines is one of the most important roles law may undertake in this battle. In relation to pharmaceuticals, the economic theory of patent protection is commonly cited by industry and in the academic literature to justify the patenting of life-saving medicines and vaccines. The economic theory of patent protection holds that innovation occurs due to patents protecting the research and development investment made by the innovator. Proponents of this theory claim that without patents such innovation in medicines and vaccines would occur at a significantly reduced rate. This Article considers the applicability of the economic theory of patent protection to pandemic influenza vaccines. This Article examines a number of factors relevant to patent law, theory, and innovation including: the patent landscape for pandemic influenza vaccines; the market dominance enjoyed by manufacturers; the actual risk posed by imitators making generic vaccines if patent protection were not in place; and, the licensing and regulatory provisions for creating generic vaccines. According to the economic theory of patent protection, a patent incentivizes innovation by providing an innovator with a temporary monopoly regarding their innovation, and by protecting them from the threat posed by imitators who wish to make a cheap replica of the product. However, even without a patent, pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturers are in this position. Due to economies of scale and the complicated regulatory and licensing frameworks relevant to bringing a pandemic influenza vaccine to market, manufacturers are at little to no risk from generic imitators. Moreover, there is a very strong incentive to innovate because pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturers are selling a product for which demand exceeds supply to a captive market of nations and organizations, each of which is hoping to secure as much vaccine as possible. The unique conditions associated with pandemic influenza vaccines appear to provide more of an incentive to innovate and research in this field than the fact that the innovations can be patented.",2016,Government & Law

The Structural Implications of Inventors' Disclosure Obligations,; PATENTS,"Disclosure theory posits that inventors must disclose knowledge about their inventions and make that knowledge freely available for certain uses during the term of a patent as part of the price that they pay for their exclusive patent rights. This Article identifies an overlooked implication of this disclosure obligation. The availability of disclosed knowledge itself for free public use during the term of a patent means that there must be limits on inventors' rights: inventors must not be allowed to transform the use of disclosed knowledge itself into infringement through strategic claiming. If they could, inventors would, oddly, be able to opt out of their mandatory disclosure obligations. To avoid this result, it is necessary to recognize the structural implications of inventors' disclosure obligations: inventors' exclusive rights must be doctrinally restricted so that inventors cannot privatize through their claims the very uses of disclosed knowledge that they are obligated to publicize through their disclosures. This implication of inventors' disclosure obligations has to date been overlooked because it requires an analysis that examines the intersection of patent law's incentive and disclosure theories, and these two theories have conventionally been examined only in isolation. In many situations that form the core of the public privilege to use disclosed knowledge itself, contemporary patent law already limits patentees' rights in the ways needed to protect the public privilege. In these situations, recognizing the structural implications of inventors' disclosure obligations would lead to a sorely needed bout of conceptual housekeeping, providing doctrinal coherence that is today absent and thus long-term stability for doctrines that today rest on shaky foundations. However, in other situations that are at the periphery of the public privilege to use disclosed knowledge itself, recognizing the structural implications of patentees' disclosure obligations may influence debates over what restrictions patent law ought to impose on patentees' rights.",2016,Government & Law
Pharmaceutical Patent Challenges: Company Strategies and Litigation Outcomes,pharmaceuticals; Hatch-Waxman Act; patent challenges; market exclusivity; generic competition; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; EXCLUSIVITY; COMPETITION; INNOVATION; RETURNS,"The pharmaceutical industry has experienced a large number of patent challenges in recent years. Key catalysts for this were legal and regulatory changes that awarded 180-day exclusivity rights for first-filing generic firms not only on the basis of a court victory, but also through a settlement with the patent owner. In this paper, we have assembled a unique data set on new drugs approved from 1994 to 2006, including detailed information on patent challenges and litigation outcomes. We find that the new regulatory environment induced significant behavioral changes, including racing by generic firms to challenge patents for large-selling drugs in an environment where more patents are filed by branded firms. Increased generic challenges to different types of patent claims are linked to reduced market exclusivity periods for branded drugs, based on regression analyses and litigation outcomes. Settlements that allow entry prior to patent expiry are a prevalent litigation outcome given the risks of an unfavorable court decision that can adversely affect a company's market valuation. This topic remains an important issue for further research, particularly given different public policies governing patent challenges for biosimilars and biologics compared with those for generic drugs and new chemical entities.",2017,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services
"Industrial Property or Artistic Property? Design, Intellectual Property Law and the PH Lamp",aesthetics; copyright; Denmark; functionalism; patent law; PH lamp; ,"The status of design under intellectual property law is unresolved in a number of ways; for more than three centuries design has vacillated in between legal categories. Notably, many current problems in the protection of intellectual property in design were already apparent by the mid-nineteenth century. Thus, in the first part of this article, the origins of and legal responses to problems that still complicate design-related intellectual property law are traced. The specific focus is on British law, which was a forerunner for other national laws on design protection. The second part of the article concentrates on Danish law and on the PH lamp, created in the 1920s by the Danish designer Poul Henningsen. An 'intellectual property biography' of the PH lamp serves to illustrate the unstable status of design under intellectual property law. Poul Henningsen relied on patent law as well as copyright law for protection against rivals. Hence the lamp has been defined, respectively, as both 'industrial property' and 'artistic property'; as an invention and as a work of art. The twofold character of the lamp in law may be linked to an unresolved relationship, in modern design in particular, between aesthetics and utility.",2017,Art

Enhancing antibody patent protection using epitope mapping information,epitope mapping; intellectual property; monoclonal antibody; novelty non-obviousness; patent; written description; ,"As the $ 100B therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) market continues to grow, developers of therapeutic mAbs increasingly face the need to strengthen patent protection of their products and enforce their patents in courts. In view of changes in the patent law landscape, patent applications are strategically using information on the precise binding sites of their mAbs, i.e., the epitopes, to support patent novelty, non-obviousness, subject matter, and a tightened written description requirement for broad genus antibody claims. Epitope data can also allow freedom-to-operate for second-generation mAbs by differentiation from patented first-generation mAbs. Numerous high profile court cases, including Amgen v. Sanofi over rival mAbs that block PCSK9 activity, have been centered on epitope mapping claims, highlighting the importance of epitopes in determining broad mAb patent rights. Based on these cases, epitope mapping claims must describe a sufficiently large number of mAbs that share an epitope, and each epitope must be described at amino acid resolution. Here, we review current best practices for the use of epitope information to overcome the increasing challenges of patenting mAbs, and how the quality, conformation, and resolution of epitope residue data can influence the breadth and strength of mAb patents.",2018,Research & Experimental Medicine

We combine measurement and governance branches of transaction cost theory to compare the efficiency of market intermediation by patent assertion entities to that of bilateral licensing agreements, patent pools, and firm integration. We consider the level of complementarity between patents and the breadth of their commercial applications to develop four general intellectual property configurations that depict distinct relationships between patent supply and patent demand. The costs and benefits of the various governance alternatives are then weighed for each configuration to identify when each alternative is likely to be most efficient. Our analysis suggests that patent assertion entities are most efficient in allocating intellectual property rights when there is substantial patent complementarity such that value is created through patent bundling, and these bundles are applicable across a broad range of product lines such that the costs of measuring infringement and its damages are substantial. We consider how the imperfections of patents as contracts between inventors and society in conjunction with rapid technological evolution contribute to the growth of patent assertion entities. This analysis provides some guidance for managers on how to appropriate value from intellectual property.",2016,Business & Economics

Firms improve the targeted products by randomly combining existing technologies owned by other firms. Furthermore, the firms contribute to the adoption of newly developed frontier technology. The innovators must attain the minimum innovation size required for a patent. That is, the patent office grants patents only for superior innovations. We show that an increase in the minimum innovation size may reduce the average patentable innovation size because of an endogenous response of the distribution of innovation size. This implies that even if the patent office requires superior innovations in order to assign patents, innovators tend to produce inferior patentable innovations on average. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Patenting human genes: Chinese academic articles' portrayal of gene patents,Human gene patents; Chinese scholars; Patentability; CONTROVERSY; PROTECTION; MYRIAD,"Background: The patenting of human genes has been the subject of debate for decades. While China has gradually come to play an important role in the global genomics-based testing and treatment market, little is known about Chinese scholars' perspectives on patent protection for human genes. Methods: A content analysis of academic literature was conducted to identify Chinese scholars' concerns regarding gene patents, including benefits and risks of patenting human genes, attitudes that researchers hold towards gene patenting, and any legal and policy recommendations offered for the gene patent regime in China. Results: 57.2% of articles were written by law professors, but scholars from health sciences, liberal arts, and ethics also participated in discussions on gene patent issues. While discussions of benefits and risks were relatively balanced in the articles, 63.5% of the articles favored gene patenting in general and, of the articles (n = 41) that explored gene patents in the Chinese context, 90.2% supported patent protections for human genes in China. The patentability of human genes was discussed in 33 articles, and 75.8% of these articles reached the conclusion that human genes are patentable. Conclusion: Chinese scholars view the patent regime as an important legal tool to protect the interests of inventors and inventions as well as the genetic resources of China. As such, many scholars support a gene patent system in China. These attitudes towards gene patents remain unchanged following the court ruling in the Myriad case in 2013, but arguments have been raised about the scope of gene patents, in particular that the increasing numbers of gene patents may negatively impact public health in China.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics; Biomedical Social Sciences
"How does law make place? Localisation, translocalisation and thing-law at the world's, first factory",; GEOGRAPHY,"This article examines how law is implicated in the formation of place, and how place in turn can shape law. It is an empirical explication of Latour's call for researchers to study the global through its local instantiations. Drawing upon recent theoretical work in both material culture studies and legal geography the article examines the interplay of law and material formations at one originating site, Sir Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mills in Derbyshire in order to examine the creation and circulation of a new form of place in the late eighteenth century: the industrial scale cotton mill. It shows how a diverse range of legal elements ranging across patent law, the Calico Acts and ancient local Derbyshire lead mining laws all helped to shape that place-form, its proliferation across the United Kingdom, and ultimately further afield. In doing so the article conceptualises processes of localisation, translocalisation and thing-law by which the abstractions of both place-forms and law elements become activated through their pragmatic local emplacement. Whilst the case study concerns 200 year old place-making machinations, many of the spatio-legal articulations of Arkwright and his opponents have a surprisingly modern feel about them. The paper therefore advocates the benefits of a longitudinal, historical approach to the study of place-making, and in particular, calls for a greater attentiveness in legal geography to law's role in the intentional formation of (work)places by their owners.

Public funded research organizations (PFROs) are believed to be an integral part of National Innovation Systems (NIS) and therefore form an important part of research focused on developing and enhancing national innovation capacities. PFROs have witnessed substantial changes in terms of increased patent filing over the years. Patenting rates and patent propensity have long been used as a well-grounded proxy for measuring technological innovations in the literature. Variant patent filing motives of researchers may reflect a fundamental weakness in use of patents for measuring innovations. Transition economies like India, with characteristics which may differ from those of heavily studied advanced western economies, are the focus of this study. Data were collected from 43 PFROs in India during the period 2005-2010. This study examined the patent filing behavior in PFROs by analyzing various motives that drive the patent filing of its researchers. Negative Binomial Regression Models were constructed to explain whether these patent filing motives impact patent portfolios in PFROs. We observed that only few of them strengthen the patent portfolios. The results connote the significance of taking granted patents, rather than filed patents, as a proxy for measure innovations in PFROs.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY STARTUPS: WHAT ENTREPRENEURS TELL US,Copyrights; trademarks; trade secrets; patents; entrepreneurship; PATENTS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; COPYRIGHT,"This chapter provides evidence on how young technology startups are employing intellectual property (IP) protection when innovating and competing in the United States. Although researchers and teachers of university technology transfer often think only in terms of patents and the Bayh-Dole Act, this chapter suggests that adopting a more nuanced view of IP rights is appropriate. After reviewing the primary non-patent types of IP protection available in the U.S. (copyright, trademark, and trade secret), we explain that while patents are often considered the strongest protection, for some entrepreneurs - particularly those operating in the U.S. software and Internet sectors - patents may be the least important means of capturing value from innovation. We present evidence from the 2008 Berkeley Patent Survey to demonstrate that IP is used by U.S. startups in very different ways, and to different effects, across technology sectors and other company-specific characteristics. Contrary to the common assumption in academic discourse, we show that different forms of IP protection often serve as complements, rather than substitutes.",2016,Business & Economics
PARLIAMENTARY REWARDS AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE PATENT SYSTEM,patents; rewards; patent specification; patent extensions; heroic inventor; RIGHTS,"This article examines the impact on the patent system of rewards for innovation across the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. During this period, Parliament would regularly grant rewards to inventors, with many of these rewards being set out in legislation. This legislation provided Parliament with the opportunity to promote a model of state support for inventors: a model that made public disclosure of the invention a precondition for assistance. This had important implications for patent law, in particular, in helping to develop the role of the patent specification and the doctrine of sufficiency of disclosure. In this way, the reward system helped establish the framework under which the state would provide support for inventors. Simultaneously, however, the reward system created a space in which inventors would have to do more than meet the minimum requirement of public disclosure. Rewards allowed the state to distinguish between different classes of inventor and to make special provision for particularly worthy individuals. In this way, the reward system recognised the contribution of the heroic inventor, whilst leaving the core of the patent system undisturbed.",2015,Government & Law
Patent Clutter,; US PATENT; INFRINGEMENT; DISCLOSURE; ECONOMICS; PROPERTY; TOO,"Patent claims are supposed to clearly and succinctly describe the patented invention, and only the patented invention. This Article hypothesizes that a substantial amount of language in patent claims is in fact not about the core invention, which may contribute to well-documented problems with patent claims. I analyze the claims of 40,000 patents and applications, and document the proliferation of clutter-language in patent claims that is not about the invention. Although claims are supposed to be exclusively about the invention, clutter appears across industries and makes up approximately 25 % of claim language. Patent clutter may contribute several major problems in patent law. Extensive clutter makes patent claims harder to search. Excessive language in patent claims may be the result of over-claiming when patentees describe potential corollaries they do not possess thereby making the patent so broad in scope as to be invalid. More generally, it strains the comprehensibility of patents and burdens the resources of patent examiners. After arguing that patent clutter may contribute to these various problems, this Article turns to reforms. Rejections based on prolix, lack of enablement, and lack of written description can be crafted to dispose of the worst offenders, and better algorithms and different litigation rules can allow the patent system to adapt (and even benefit from) the remaining uses of excess language. The Article additionally generates important theoretical insights. Claims are often thought of as entirely synonymous with the invention and all elements of the claim are thought to relate equally strongly to the invention. This Article suggests empirically that these assumptions do not hold in practice, and offers a framework for restructuring conceptions of the relationship between claims and the invention.",2018,Government & Law
Combining Concept Mapping with Entropy Information to Evaluate the Level of Patent Disclosure,Patentable; Invention Disclose; Patent Scope; Energy-Saving; Information Entropy; INDICATORS; INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS,"In this study, concept mapping is used to analyze and measure the patent claims in terms of several assessment criteria, which included claims, hierarchies, links, branches and exemplified embodiments. The weight of each assessment criteria was calculated using entropy theory in order to quantify the knowledge structure of a patent claims and identify differences between patent documents. The use of information entropy theory creates an entropy distribution which allows us to evaluate the level of patent disclosure. This is the first time that entropy weight and concept mapping have been used together in the field of patent analysis. This study asserts that concept mapping is a useful tool for inventors trying to adequately disclose the technical content of their inventions, as use which would increase the likelihood of the patent application being successful. While this study uses concept mapping to analyze the technical content of patent documents, its use as a tool for disclosure would allow inventors to better comprehend and detail the knowledge structure of their invention, thus improving the quality of patent documents. It is worth mentioning that Patent Law requires applicants to meet standards for sufficiency of disclosure, with the aim that any person moderately skilled in the art can implement the invention disclosed in the patent documents.",2018,Engineering
PATENT TROLLS AND CLAIM CONSTRUCTION,; ,"This Article explores the largely overlooked relationship between claim construction and patent assertion entities (patent trolls), finding that claim construction problems and trends benefit patent assertion entities. First, the Federal Circuit's deep divide over the proper approach to claim construction creates uncertain patent scope, which is widely recognized as a core reason for the success of patent assertion entities. Second, case law and commentary increasingly endorse an approach to claim construction that relies on the general meaning in the technical field with limited reliance on the patent itself, which benefits patent assertion entities by increasing the breadth and uncertainty of patent scope. Third, the Supreme Court's recent adoption of a more deferential standard of review for claim construction in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. increases the benefits patent assertion entities receive from filing in favorable district courts, like the Eastern District of Texas, as well as their incentives to do so. If patent assertion entities are as problematic as widely thought, these claim construction problems and trends warrant reconsideration. Current claim construction rules and trends may be warranted despite their positive impact on patent assertion entities. And other means may exist for combatting patent assertion entities without altering claim construction rules or trends. But the positive effects for patent assertion entities must at least be factored into any cost-benefit analysis of claim construction rules. Moreover, the fact that current claim construction rules and trends produce the conditions under which patent assertion entities thrive suggests that patent assertion entities may be a symptom of larger problems with claim construction doctrine.",2016,Government & Law
Promissories and pharmaceutical patents: agencing markets through public narratives,market agencement; performativity; promissory; market representations; narrative; Sector Inquiry; pharmaceutical industry; market studies; EXPECTATIONS; CONSTRUCTION; SENSEMAKING; TECHNOLOGY; DISCOURSE,"We investigate a body of data emanating from the 2008/2009 EU Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, interpreting the collection of submissions to it as a concerted attempt at market innovation that becomes fraught with challenge and contest. In the pharmaceutical market, interests associated with patient concerns, government budgets, global Big Pharma, and local small pharma coalesce and compete with patent law, technological innovation and drug lifecycles. Our research question is: What role do market narratives play in shaping the market's socio-technical agencements? By introducing market narratives, we focus on the performative effects of temporality and iteration. Our argument is that by acting as (contested) promissories, market narratives contribute to agencing a market, such that actors are engaged continually in juxtaposing and adjusting their representations of it and putting in place those socio-technical agencements that make the markets resemble those narratives. Narrating a market becomes a collective and iterative task of equipping actors to shape the markets that they desire.",2016,Business & Economics
Copyright exceptions and contract in the UK: the impact of recent amendments,copyright exceptions; contract; copyright; Copyright; Designs and Patents Act 1988; ,"In June and October 2014 a number of amendments to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 came into effect, introducing new copyright exceptions and amending several existing exceptions. While following recent judicial review the private copying exception has been quashed, many of the remaining new exceptions significantly alter the relationship between copyright exceptions and contract, making contractual terms unenforceable where those terms restrict users from taking advantage of an exception. This paper explores the rationale for the UK amendments and considers whether the changes, as implemented, prevent rights holders from contracting out of exceptions and whether they increase the clarity of the copyright system.",2016,Government & Law
What is the causal effect of R&D on patenting activity in a professor's privilege country?

The general responsiveness to R&D is found to be higher than corresponding estimates in US studies, especially when we adopt instrumental variable techniques that address endogeneity in the R&D-to-patent relationship studied. We also find that this responsiveness is not associated with a lower quality of patents measured in terms of citations. A higher responsiveness from R&D to patenting is found in the fields of chemical engineering, chemistry (science), electrical engineering, electronics, and photonics, information technology, medicine, and microbiology than in other patenting fields. Our main result, that academia in Sweden contributes well to inventive activity, supports the view that the professor's privilege-that university researchers themselves have ownership to their inventions-may be a contributing factor.",2016,Business & Economics
Innovation Topic Analysis of Technology: The Case of Augmented Reality Patents,Patent mining; topic modeling; network analysis; opportunity analysis; augmented reality technology; NETWORK ANALYSIS; TRENDS; FREQUENCY; MAP,"Innovation topics within a technology can be defined as generalized technical subjects that the technology desires to develop or improve. Since innovation topics act as a driving force for technical innovation, monitoring such concepts is necessary for understanding the current technology and directing further R&D. However, little attention has been paid to identifying latent innovation topics within a technology, and analyzing their relationships and potential for opportunity. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-step approach to technological innovation topic analysis, on the basis of patents. The steps consist of: 1) structuring patent-keyword vectors; 2) identifying innovation topics based on semantic patent analysis; 3) constructing an innovation topic network; and 4) generating an opportunity-focused innovation topic map. The process of our approach is illustrated using patents that are related to augmented reality. This method can contribute to the systematic monitoring of a technology system's innovation topics and their potential.",2018,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications
Response of patent medicine vendors in rural areas of Lagos state Nigeria to antimalarial policy change,Patent Medicine Vendors; ACTs; policy change; malaria; artemisinin monotherapies; non-artemisinin therapies; MALARIA TREATMENT; CHILDHOOD FEVERS; PROVIDERS; SERVICES; SELLERS,"Background: Patent medicine vendors (PMVs) play an important role in the treatment of malaria, especially in the rural areas. Nigeria recently changed her antimalarial treatment policy from chloroquine to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Objectives: To determine the response of PMVs to the new policy. Methods: A baseline study was conducted in two local government areas (LGAs) of Lagos state Nigeria as the first phase in an intervention study aimed at improving the malarial treatment practices of PMVs in rural Lagos. A mixed method design involving a questionnaire survey of 180 PMVs and four key informant interviews were used. An antimalarial drug (AMD) audit was also performed. Results: More than 80% of respondents were aware of the policy change in malaria treatment, but only 23.9% sold an ACT for the last case of malaria treated in an under five child. The main determining factor of the particular AMD sold was PMV's personal choice (70.6%). About half (58.9%) of the shops stocked ACTs, the newly recommended antimalarials. Conclusions: The high awareness of the policy change did not translate to a commensurate increase in the sale of the new drugs. Factors beyond the PMVs need to be addressed for a successful adoption of the new policy.",2015,General & Internal Medicine
"Tailored Treatment, Tailored Enforcement: Protecting Innovation in Personalized Medicine from a Patent-Protection Loophole",; ,"A once obscure patent law doctrine, divided infringement, threatens the future of innovation in life-saving medical treatments. This anomaly, shaped by software patent cases but applicable to enforcement of any method patent, provides a patent-protection loophole for certain infringers. Divided infringement has generated much discussion and a recent Supreme Court decision, Limelight v. Akamai, because of its effect on patent protection for computer networking technology. But this incongruity in patent enforcement also has notable implications for development of personalized-medicine and other patentable medical-treatment methods. Various solutions to the problem posed by divided infringement how to hold multiple individuals collectively responsible for infringing a method patent have been suggested elsewhere. One of the most logical proposals is that whoever finishes a patented method by implementing the method's last step infringes the method as a whole. Such a broad rule, however, might be opposed by those fearful of provoking yet more disputes over software patents. This Note proposes a more targeted rule for medical-method patent cases: that the healthcare provider who uses a medical-treatment method commits direct infringement of a patent on that method despite enlisting another party to perform diagnostic testing or drug administration steps intrinsic to the method. This proposed theory of infringement would provide a predicate for lawsuits against culpable competitor companies through standard indirect or vicarious liability theories.",2016,Government & Law
"Roy Porter Student Prize Essay, Gilding the Pill: The Sensuous Consumption of Patent Medicines, 1815-1841",patent medicines; consumption; sensory history; marketing; packaging; ,"This article aims to remove patent medicines from the traditional quack/orthodox binary and reconsider them as material objects within sensory networks of production, distribution and consumption. Patent medicines offer a unique perspective on material history by being twice consumed; first through traditional exchange, followed by the private act of ingestion. Recognising both these interpretations, this article deconstructs the multisensory consumer experience engineered by nineteenth-century patent medicine proprietors. It argues that proprietors, fuelled by competition and aided by manufacturing innovations, refocused branding on the sensory qualities of their product. Standardised colours, shapes, textures and flavours encouraged consumers to draw a relationship between the reliable appearance of a product and the authenticity of the contents within. Tracing these synesthetic cues from the print media campaign through to the moment of ingestion extends the medical transaction and highlights the sophistication of nineteenth-century marketing tactics.",2018,History; History & Philosophy of Science
NO FORUM TO RULE THEM ALL: COMITY AND CONFLICT IN TRANSNATIONAL FRAND DISPUTES,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PATENT ENFORCEMENT; ANTITRUST-LAW; HARMONIZATION; COMPETITION; SHADOW; CHOICE,"Recent years have seen an explosion in FRAND litigation, in which parties commit to license intellectual property under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms, but they cannot agree on the meaning of that commitment. Much of this litigation is multinational and involves coordinating patent, antitrust, and contract claims across several jurisdictions. A number of courts and commentators have aimed to centralize and thereby streamline these disputes, whether by consolidating all litigation in one judicial forum or through the creation of a comprehensive arbitral process. This Article argues that such efforts are misguided-FRAND disputes are particularly unamenable to centralization, and the costs of centralizing FRAND disputes are high. Rather, absent other agreement between the parties, FRAND disputes should be resolved through the ordinary territorial structures of patent law, and attempts to simplify these disputes should focus on procedural and substantive coordination across jurisdictions.",2019,Government & Law
INVESTIGATING THE HYPOTHETICAL REASONABLE ROYALTY FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT,; ,"Congress has legislated into the Copyright Act of 1976 three types of monetary rewards for victorious plaintiffs in copyright infringement cases: (1) actual damages according to proof of how much harm was suffered by the copyright owner as a result of the infringement, (2) the infringer's profits from the copyright infringements, or (3) statutory damages. On occasion, cases have arisen in which copyright infringement is proven, yet none of these three forms of monetary relief are available. To redress that apparent anomaly, some courts have approved an alternative recovery, namely a monetary award equal to a hypothetical royalty based on what a willing buyer would have paid a willing seller to license the copyrighted material. Select cases have adopted this fourth form of monetary damages when infringement is found and the first three forms of relief are unavailable. This Article analyzes the rationale of those cases, rooted in the legislative history of the Copyright Act of 1976 and a comparison to patent law to show that, as appealing as this fourth form of damages might appear, its reward is contrary to the language of the Act and the intent of Congress. Therefore, courts should not award this form of monetary relief, unless and until Congress amends the Act to that effect.",2019,Government & Law
Influencing Mechanism of Patent Alliance on Technical Innovation from Network Effects Perspective,patent alliance; innovation; network effects; ,"As an important tool to promote the technical standards for enterprises, a patent alliance can reduce transaction costs and lawsuit disputes as well as accelerate the promotion and application of proprietary technologies. Moreover, it can enlarge the installed base and influence consumers' expectations by exploiting the network effects of technical standards. As a result, it can be one of the most effective paths to resolve the problem of patent thicket and promote innovation. Based on several theories with respect to the network effects, this study analyzed the connotation and composition of network effects for technical standards and constructed a concept model that can influence innovations using a patent alliance. A questionnaire investigation was conducted, and an analysis was performed using the structural equation to examine the factors affecting the innovation of patent tools as well as their acting paths. The main research conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) patent alliance is a double-edged sword for technical innovation. The factors related to the patent alliance and network effect, such as the installation-foundation effect, consumer expectation, and positive feedback effect, promote innovation. However, the lock-in effect in the network effect hinders the innovation. (2) Identification of intellectual property and partners is the key factor that influences patent alliance innovation. (3) Standardization strategies and the government play the least role among all innovation factors influencing patent alliance.",2019,Computer Science
"Lost adaptations: piracy, Rip Offs', and the Australian Copyright Act 1905",; ,"By investigating the early Australian feature films, through the Australian Copyright Act 1905, begins a discussion on the emerging industrialisation of patent and copyright law, which did not recognise celluloid pictures as matter that could be copyrighted. With the Act formed to provide authors greater powers to stop the proliferation of degraded versions of their work, film-makers came to adaptation as a strategy to legally protect their moving pictures from copyright infringements. By concentrating on the Australian cinema's early tradition of adaptation, during the nascent period of film production (1906-1911), in this article, I will discuss how film-makers at, and outside of, the cinema were encouraged to engage with feature films as adaptation - and what this culturally meant. In a time of uncontrolled piracy and plagiarism rip offs', adaptations of popular works became a means for producers to copyright their films. And it was through this Act that the tradition of Australian adaptation began. By investigating the industrial factors behind where, why and how this tradition was culturally and socially shaped will identify by what means adaptation was spawned from the industry of copyright in a time where film-makers were trying to distinguish their works in a crowded field of film production and exhibition.",2017,"Film, Radio & Television"
On the Rationality of Bundled Rebate Program in Modem Chip Industry: an Analysis on Qualcomm's Case,Bundled rebate program; Patent licensing; Modem chip industry; Law and business; LICENSING STRATEGY,"This paper examines the motivations of a patent holder, for example, Qualcomm holding many standard essential patents (SEPs) on modem chips, to implement a bundled rebate program for its customers, Apple for instance, under the risk of violating antitrust law. This study originates from the lawsuit between Qualcomm, Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Apple. In early 2017, both FTC and Qualcomm's customer, Apple, sued Qualcomm for violating antitrust law. Qualcomm was alleged to have manipulated web of contracts by implementing so-called no license, no chips policy to achieve its anticompetitive purpose. By addressing the case law of antitrust regime related to bundled rebate and loyalty discount, we understand legal risks that Qualcomm might face. Moreover, in this paper, we build a game-theoretical model to explore business reasons why Qualcomm insists on implementing the bundled rebate and loyalty discount program, regardless of latent legal risks. It is shown that Qualcomm might desire to mitigate future loss from price war with potential competitors. Finally, this article concludes with expectations for future studies on the impact of the Federal Court if SEPs and modem chips cannot be bundled together.",2019,Business & Economics
ENABLING LIFE,; PATENT,"Many biotechnology products are living organisms that are essentially made by a trial and error process of directing evolution in a laboratory. Decades ago, the Supreme Court in Chakrabarty settled the threshold question of patent eligibility for life forms, stating clearly that living things are patentable. Nevertheless, the fact that nature assists inventors so heavily in the process of inventing a useful new organism raises the question of whether such organisms meet patent law's enablement requirement that a patent application must teach a person of ordinary skill in the art how to make and use the invention without undue experimentation. This Note argues that the enablement requirement has been overlooked for patents to genetically engineered organisms, and proposes solutions for updating this requirement to properly incentivize the creation of socially beneficial living things, without allowing inventors to bar access to products of nature.",2016,Government & Law
Patent haemostasis prevents radial artery occlusion in patients with an acute coronary syndrome,Radial artery occlusion; Transradial coronary catheterization; Acute coronary syndrome; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; TRANSRADIAL CATHETERIZATION; FEMORAL APPROACH; DOSE HEPARIN; ANGIOGRAPHY; INTERVENTION; METAANALYSIS; ACCESS; COMPLICATIONS,"Background: A haemostatic technique that maintains radial artery flow (patent haemostasis) following transradial catheterization reduces rates of radial artery occlusion (RAO) in patients with stable coronary disease. It is unclear whether this benefit extends to patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: Patients undergoing inpatient transradial catheterization for an ACS were prospectively enrolled in a consecutive cohort study (n = 300). Radial haemostasis was obtained using standard radial compression (cohort 1; n = 150) or patent haemostasis (cohort 2; n= 150). An end-of-case activated clotting time (ACT) was recorded and radial artery patency assessed within 24 hours of sheath removal by reverse Barbeau's test. Results: The incidence of RAO was 16.0% following standard radial compression and 5.3% following patent haemostasis (p = 0.003). Univariate predictors of RAO were patent haemostasis (OR 0.30; [0.13-0.68], p = 0.004), hyperlipidaemia (OR 0.46; [0.21-0.98], p = 0.04), history of current smoking (OR 2.86; [1.3-6.0], p = 0.015) and longer procedure times (OR 1.03/additional minute; [1.01-1.05], p = 0.003). There was no association between the end-of-case ACT and RAO (OR 1.00; [0.9-1.01] p = 1.00). After adjusting for covariates, patent haemostasis reduced the risk of RAO by 70% compared to standard compression (OR 0.30; [0.12-0.77], p = 0.12). The c-statistic for model discrimination was 0.79 (95% CI [0.71-0.86], p < 0.001). Inverse probability treatment weighted analysis also confirmed patent haemostasis as an independent predictor of reduced RAO (OR 0.38 [0.15-0.95], p = 0.039). Conclusion: Patent haemostasis is highly effective in preventing early RAO in patients with ACS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
"TO BILSKI, AND BEYOND: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF JUDICIAL OPACITY ON PATENT LAW AND THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE",; ,"Patentable subject matter is a critical issue in patent litigation, both at the administrative and judicial level. In a 2010 decision, Bilski v. Kappos, the Supreme Court significantly altered the standard for defining what is patentable subject matter by eliminating the physicality requirement and ruling that the Federal Circuit's machine or transformation test (MOT) was no longer the sole litmus test for determining the patent eligibility of a process claim, but rather, was an investigative clue. Many academics and commentators predicted that the Bilski decision would have an enormous impact on patent applicants, litigants, examiners, and other participants in the patent system. To date, however, there has been no comprehensive empirical study of Bilski's actual impact on patentable subject matter, either at the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) or at the courts. This Note fills this gap by not only being the first to undertake an empirical study of Bilski's actual impact, but also by being the first to empirically study the doctrine of patentable subject matter as it is applied by PTO examiners. We analyzed eight years of PTO decisions-four years before and after Bilski was decided. We found compelling evidence that not only are PTO examiners more likely to issue Section 101 rejections for business method patents post-Bilski as compared to pre-Bilski, but they are also more likely to continue to rely on the MOT test in making Section 101 patentable subject matter rejections for applications that fall under business methods versus other classes, such as telecommunications. Finally, our results strongly suggest that patent applicants are picking up on these entrenched behavioral norms at the PTO by being more likely to cite to machines or recite transformations when drafting business method applications, as opposed to applications for medical diagnostics. These results present profound policy implications for business method patents, for the doctrine of patentable subject matter, and also for administrative law, more generally.",2016,Government & Law
Patent Silences,; BOUNDARY OBJECTS; DISCLOSURE; KNOWLEDGE; LAW; MARKETPLACE; AUDIENCE; TIME,"A great deal has been said in recent years about patent disclosure. But to say that there is a disclosure function in the patent system implies that there is non-disclosure functioning in the patent system as well. For some information to be disclosed in a patent, other information must go undisclosed; for some things to be included, other things must be excluded. In this article I review the surprising number of doctrines that allow and encourage patent applicants to remain silent about aspects of their inventions. I find that some silences in patents are inadvertent, while some are deliberate; some are necessary, while some are strategic. I conclude that a combination of such explicit and tacit silences allows patents to function as boundary objects, that is, as artifacts that have sufficiently definite meaning to be useful in disparate social worlds, but which simultaneously are sufficiently ambiguous to become objects of collaboration between disparate social worlds. Because innovation is known to occur when localized knowledge is transferred across social boundaries, this function of the patent document is critical to its stated purpose, and occurs largely because of its open rhetorical spaces. Thus, rather than fixating on enhanced disclosure, I argue that much of the critical work of the patent system can and should occur in the open rhetorical spaces where patents are silent.",2016,Government & Law

By investigating the patenting behavior of Chinese listed firms between 2002 and 2011, we find that the presence of institutional investors enhances firm innovation. Consistent with this monitoring view, we further find that (1) the effect of institutional investors on firm patenting mainly comes from mutual funds; (2) the effect is more pronounced when product market competition is more intense; (3) the effect exists among private-and minority state-owned enterprises, but not among majority state-owned enterprises. The above findings remain robust when innovation quality is examined.",2017,Business & Economics
Machine Learning at the Patent Office: Lessons for Patents and Administrative Law,; PROPERTY; SYSTEM,"The empirical data indicate that a relatively small increment of additional U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Patent Office or USPTO) investment in prior art search at the initial examination stage could be a cost-effective mechanism for improving accuracy in the patent system. This contribution argues that machine learning provides a promising arena for such investment. Notably, the use of machine learning in patent examination does not raise the same potent concerns about individual rights and discrimination that it raises in other areas of administrative and judicial process. To be sure, even an apparently easy case like prior art search at the USPTO poses challenges. The most important generalizable challenge relates to explainability. The USPTO has stressed transparency to the general public as necessary for achieving adequate explainability. However, at least in contexts like prior art search, adequate explainability does not require full transparency. Moreover, full transparency would chill provision of private sector expertise and would be susceptible to gaming.",2019,Government & Law
Using aggregate market data to estimate patent value: An application to United States smartphones 2010 to 2015,Competition; Intellectual property; Random-coefficient logit demand; Patent; Smartphones; MONOPOLY; EQUILIBRIUM; PERSISTENCE; INNOVATION; DEMAND,"Intellectual property and its protection is one of the most valuable assets for entrepreneurs and firms in the information economy. This article describes a relatively straightforward approach to measuring patent value with aggregate market data and the BLP model. We apply the approach to United States smartphones. The demand estimates and recovered marginal costs produce sensible simulations of equilibria prices and shares from several hypothetical patent infringements. In one simulation, the presence of near field communication on the dominant firm's flagship smartphone results in a 29% increase in profits. This estimate provides a starting point for establishing a reasonable royalty between the patent holder and the dominant firm in a hypothetical negotiation. This simulation also shows that law-abiding firms inside the market may be damaged by the dominant firm's patent infringing behavior. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We study the effects of variations over time and across countries in the strength of domestic patent rights (PRs) on exports in high-R&D goods. Adopting a generalized factor-proportions framework, we interact industry research intensity with national PRs. Countries with stronger PRs have significantly greater exports in research-intensive sectors. These effects are positive in emerging and developing economies but smaller than in developed economies.

"The good, the bad and the ugly - the future of patent assertion entities in Europe",Patent markets; patent assertion entities; unitary patent; forum shopping; LITIGATION,"Most of the available evidence on patent assertion entities (PAEs) is coming from the United States, while little is known for Europe. The up-coming Unitary Patent (UP) and the Unified Patent Court (UPC) system are considered to be game-changing elements for strategic patent options and for patent assertion activity in Europe. Many patent practitioners are watching Europe as the future market place for patenting. PAE activity in Europe is increasing and one reason for this trend is that PAEs originating from the United States are becoming more active in Europe. In the future, fuzzy boundaries of patent claims in general and of software-related claims in particular, new combinations of technologies and enhanced interoperability under the schemes of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things could attract PAE activity in technological fields where it has not been seen before. Altogether, some of the features of the new UPC have the potential to play into the hands of PAEs in Europe. The future will much depend on the implementation of the new UPC system, how the different divisions of the court will establish case law decisions and how PAEs will make use of the new system. The intention of the article is to provide an overview of ongoing PAE activity in Europe and to assess the future strategic options of PAEs in Europe based on the design of the new UP and UPC system.",2018,Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics
Rising Economies in the International Patent Regime: From Rule-breakers to Rule-changers and Rule-makers,Emerging countries; patent; regime complex; transnational network; policy diffusion; intellectual property; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; CHINA; INDIA; DIFFUSION; POLITICS,"Rising economies face a crucial dilemma when establishing their position on international patent law. Should they translate their increasing economic strength into political power to further developing countries' interests in lower levels of international patent protection? Or, anticipating a rising domestic interest in stronger international patent protection, should they adopt a position that favours maximal patent protection? Drawing on multiple case studies using a most-similar system design, we argue that rising economies, after having been coerced into adopting more stringent patent standards, tend to display ambivalent positions, trapped in bureaucratic politics and caught between conflicting domestic constituencies. We find that the recent proliferation of international institutions and the expansion of transnational networks have contributed to fragmentation and polarisation in domestic patent politics. As a result, today's emerging economies experience a more tortuous transformative process than did yesterday's. This finding is of particular relevance for scholars studying rising powers, as well as for those working on policy diffusion, regulatory regimes, transnational networks and regime complexes.",2018,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
!Reining in the rules for 'lost profits' damages in patent law,patents; computation of lost profits; legal remedies; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LIABILITY RULES; PRODUCTS,"The thesis of this paper is that the prevailing model governing the computation of patent lost profits damages in Commonwealth jurisdictions does not align well with the true nature of the patent system and is therefore apt to derail the social welfare intendinents of the system. The article makes this argument based on two principal considerations. The first is that the current model encourages judicial speculation on patentees' compensatory entitlement, thereby creating room for inherent lottery or windfall effects for patentees. The second, which advances the first, is that the prevailing model flies in the face of both the contemporary state of innovation and the social welfare objectives of the patent system. The submission of this paper is that to correct this state of affairs, where patented goods have perfect and imperfect market substitutes, then reasonable royalties alone are sufficient as a monetary remedy. However, where patented goods have 'zero' market substitutes (ie where the infringer could not have competed without infringing), only then would it be proper to apply lost profit damages.",2019,Government & Law
The Impact of Myriad and Mayo: Will Advancements in the Biological Sciences Be Spurred or Disincentivized? (Or Was Biotech Patenting Not Complicated Enough?),; ,"For years, purified and isolated naturally occurring biological substances of great medical importance-including genes-have been the subject of U.S. patents. Similarly, methods in which the detection of a biological substance (e.g., in a blood sample) dictates subsequent actions, as in disease diagnostics and treatment, have long enjoyed patent protection. However, two recent Supreme Court cases, Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. (133 S. Ct. 2107) (2013) and Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (132 S. Ct. 1289) (2012), have shaken up the status quo of biotech patenting. The highest court in our land unanimously agreed with patent challengers that much of what we took for granted as patentable subjectmatter is not, as amatter of law, eligible for patenting after all. This review discusses the Myriad and Mayo cases, their impact on which biologybased innovationswemayormay not continue to patent, andwhether the altered status quo is benignly corrective or gravely disruptive. Is what happened here a good thing or not?",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine
Examining the Implementation of a European Patent Management System in Brazil from an Actor-Network Theory Perspective,patent office; technology transfer; Actor-Network Theory; Patent Management Systems; developing countries; E-GOVERNMENT; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COMMUNICATION; CHALLENGES; KNOWLEDGE; LESSONS; INDIA,"Drawing upon the Brazilian experience, this article aims at examining some of the key issues associated with e-government technical cooperation programs designed to enhance the service provision of Patent Offices in developing countries. In order to do that, this work adopts the Actor-Network Theory as a framework for understanding the processes of transferring e-government technologies from the European Patent Office (EPO) to the Brazilian Patent Office, which is locally called Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (INPI). This longitudinal study aims to contribute to the limited empirical evidence surrounding technical cooperation involving Patent Office organizations. Our findings suggest that gaps and conflicts among the existing national laws and policies, duration and type of historical interactions among EPO and INPI, as well as differences in the Information Technology infrastructure and capabilities of the participating organizations are the key issues in e-government technology transfer between EPO and INPI.",2016,Development Studies; Information Science & Library Science
Drafting eligible biotech and immunotherapy claims,Patent eligible; biotech; immunotherapy; CAFC; PATENTS,"The very recent US Supreme Court and Court of Appeals for Federal Circuit (CAFC) cases have dramatically changed the standard of patent eligibility. Several groundbreaking innovations were thus determined to be patent ineligible. The patent ineligibility would impact on the innovation s of the field of biomarkers, diagnostic methods and personalize cancer immunotherapy. To solve the thorny problem of eligibility, this study retrospectively analyzes all CAFC related cases and presents a flow chart determining patent eligibility based on the courts' decisions. Our analysis indicates the best way to avoid eligible rejection or invalidation is that an invention cannot fall within the categories of natural law, natural phenomenon or abstract idea. Thus, claiming non-natural cDNA, involving a step to grow a transformed cell or adding a means clause in a method claim would be some possible solutions. Moreover, based on the flow chart, even though a claim with substantive limitation but not well-understood, routine or conventional activities would be patent eligible; no one has successfully made the argument in the CAFC so far. We believe that this flow chart can serve as a set of guidelines for determining patent eligibility.",2019,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Immunology
The compatibility law of Chinese patent medicines for the treatment of coronary heart disease angina pectoris based on association rules and complex network,Coronary heart disease angina pectoris; Chinese patent medicine; compatibility law; association rules; complex network; GLOBAL BURDEN,"Objective: To analyze the compatibility law of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) for the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) and provide the basis for CPM development. Methods: A total of 248 kinds of CPMs for CHD were collected from the pharmacopoeias published during 1949 to 2014. Computational techniques and datamining analysis were used to analyze the association rules and complex network within these CPMs. Results: These CPMs contain 5.71 +/- 4.31 kinds of herb saveragely. Activating blood circulation and eliminating stasis account for the largest proportion of their functions (125 out of 248, 50.40%). The most commonly used herbs are Salvia miltiorrhiza (contained in 122 CPMs, 49.19%), Notoginseng (in 82 CPMs, 33.06%) and Ligusticumwallichii (in 77 CPMs, 31.05%). The most common double-paired and triple-paired herbs are also identified. The compatibility laws and confidence coefficient were calculated. In the association network of these CPMs, the core herbs are Salvia miltiorrhiza, Notoginseng, Ginseng, Borneol and Ligusticumwallichii. Conclusion: Activating blood circulation and eliminating stasis is the major function of CPMs for CHD. Understanding the association rules in CPMs helps us to comprehend the composition and function laws of CPMs, which is important for the utilization of currently used CPMs, and the development of new CPMs.",2016,Research & Experimental Medicine
INVALIDATING ISSUE PRECLUSION: RETHINKING PRECLUSION IN THE PATENT CONTEXT,; LITIGATION; JUDGMENTS; PROPERTY,"Preclusion is a complex doctrine to apply in any given case, and patent litigation presents no exception. Ever since the Supreme Court ruled in Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation that issue preclusion applies to prevent litigation on a patent that previously has been declared invalid in a court of competent jurisdiction, courts have applied issue preclusion summarily to end disputes over previously invalidated patents. But issue preclusion may not be an appropriate procedural tool in all such cases. In fact, analysis of a number of district court opinions demonstrates that some judges may explicitly or implicitly realize the same. This Comment both systematically analyzes the application of issue preclusion in the patent validity context from a doctrinal perspective and addresses significant practical concerns derived from the doctrinal findings. Interestingly, this analysis suggests that the Federal Circuit and most district courts are applying the law of issue preclusion incorrectly and that this practice has significant implications for litigants. Primarily, courts' treatment of patent invalidity as a whole as a single issue for the purposes of issue preclusion is out of line with the application of that doctrine in other areas of civil law. Although the misapplication of issue preclusion is a moot point in most cases where a patent is adjudged invalid and that holding is maintained on appeal, it is of practical significance for simultaneous litigation over a single patent in multiple district courts. A new procedural framework is proposed to remedy the doctrinal and practical problems raised by the current application of issue preclusion in the patent validity context. Instead of entering judgment based on issue preclusion, which is inappropriate in many cases, there are substantial policy concerns favoring either applying claim preclusion, dismissing the plaintiff's action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or simply staying the patent litigation pending final appeal of an earlier proceeding over the same property right.",2017,Government & Law
Evaluating The Impact Of The Orphan Drug Act's Seven-Year Market Exclusivity Period,; CLINICAL-TRIALS; PATENTS; ACCESS,"For thirty-five years the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 has provided incentives for pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop drugs to treat rare diseases-conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US. One key statutory incentive is an exclusive seven-year marketing right for the rare disease indication, which has been heralded as driving a dramatic increase in the number of rare disease treatments. However, most new drugs are also protected by patents. In this study we assessed all new small-molecule drugs approved in the period 1985-2014 that had at least one indication for an orphan-designated disease as of January 1, 2017. We found that orphan drug exclusivity outlasted the last expiring patent in 33 percent of cases overall, and in a smaller percentage of cases for each successive ten-year drug cohort: from 50 percent for drugs approved in 1985-94 to 35 percent for those approved in 1995-2004 and 18 percent for those approved in 2005-14. The Orphan Drug Act's market exclusivity incentive has played an increasingly smaller role in protecting rare disease drugs from competition, while rare disease drugs have substantially increased as a fraction of all new drug approvals.",2018,Health Care Sciences & Services
Impact of stronger patent regimes on technology transfer; The case study of Thai automotive industry,Thailand; Intellectual property regime; Knowledge transfer; Automotive industry; Co-evolution; ,"This paper illustrates a small extent of co-evolution of IPR regime and technological capability of Thai automotive firms. This study analysed the primary data on Thai IP-related law, regulation, firms' R&D and innovation surveys, patent registration, court litigation, and conducted interviews for case studies of firms, policy Makers, and university professors specialised in the automotive industry. The results show that there are some atmospheric changes in terms of increasing awareness of importance of patent after the regime became stronger. The stronger patent regime has slight impacts on the extent and nature of knowledge transfer between transnational corporations and local part suppliers. Last, the stronger patent regime has impacts on firms climbing up technological ladders from production to more sophisticated activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Ensuring Expeditious Entry: Korea and the US Regulatory Pathway for Bringing Biosimilars to Market,patent-approval linkage; biosimilar; Korean Pharmaceutical Affairs Act; Green List; Purple Book; patent dance; ,"Biosimilar products are expected to encounter substantial barriers in their efforts to compete with branded biologics. Current biosimilar regulatory regimes in both Korea and the U.S. raise questions about the viability of successfully bringing competition, innovation, and affordability into the biological products market as intended. Thus, bringing a biologic to market presents significant challenges that necessitate complex situations and subsequent legal regimes. This article will discuss the bilateral implications of each respective biosimilar regulatory pathway and the procedures each regime uses to resolve patent disputes. In particular, key amendments in pharmaceutical intellectual property provisions pursuant to the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement suggest that select bilateral regulatory principles can enhance biosimilar market involvement. As a corollary, Korea's first invalidation action and several related cases in the U.S. in which courts interpreted some of the important provisions of the Korean Pharmaceutical Affairs Act and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 are analyzed using a comparative approach. Finally, future developments and exogenous factors that may impact the expeditious entry of the future first biosimilars into the two countries are applied to these legal regimes.",2018,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology
AN ADMINISTRATIVE METER MAID: USING INTER PARTES REVIEW AND POST-GRANT REVIEW TO CURB EXCLUSIVITY PARKING VIA THE FAILURE TO MARKET PROVISION OF THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT,; HISTORY,"Congress created the unique Hatch-Waxman framework in 1984 to increase the availability of low-cost generic drugs while preserving patent incentives for new drug development. The Hatch-Waxman Act rewards generic drug companies that successfully challenge a pharmaceutical patent: 180 days of market exclusivity before any other generic firm can enter the market. When a generic firm obtains this reward, sometimes drug developers agree to pay generic firms to delay entering the market. These pay-for-delay agreements give rise to exclusivity parking and run counter to congressional intent by delaying full generic drug competition. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act created several statutory forfeiture provisions that proved only marginally effective at curbing the practice of exclusivity parking. More recently, Congress created new quasi-judicial administrative proceedings that effectively replace certain kinds of district court patent litigation. This Note describes the complex statutory scheme that gave rise to exclusivity parking, explains why previous and current attempts to curtail exclusivity parking were and remain ineffective, and suggests amending the failure to market provision to include these new administrative proceedings as a way to help curb exclusivity parking.",2015,Government & Law
"Trade Secrecy Injunctions, Disclosure Risks, and eBay's Influence",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LIABILITY RULES; PATENT HOLDUP; COVENANTS; KNOWLEDGE; DOCTRINE; LAW,"Historically, intellectual property (IP) owners could rely on injunctive remedies to prevent continued infringement. The Supreme Court's eBay v. MercExchange decision changed this, however. After eBay, patent courts no longer apply presumptions that push the deliberative scales in favor of injunctions (or property rule protection). Instead, patent injunctions require a careful four-factor analysis, where plaintiffs must demonstrate irreparable injury (i.e., that money damages cannot compensate). Without question, eBay has made it harder for patent plaintiffs to secure injunctions, and has led many district courts to consider innovation policy concerns (e.g., the strategic behavior of patent troll plaintiffs) in the injunction calculus. By and large, courts' more deliberative approach to patent injunctions post-eBay has been viewed as beneficial for the patent system. Over the past decade, eBay's influence has migrated to other areas of IP. This article offers the first account of eBay's impact on federal trade secrecy injunctions. Important differences between trade secret law and other areas of IP-for example, the hard-to-quantify risk that disclosure poses to trade secret owners-has lessened eBay's influence on trade secrecy injunctions. This article argues that disclosure risks justify a bifurcated approach to trade secrecy injunctions. That is, in cases involving the dissemination of trade secrets, courts should presume irreparable injury in the injunction calculus. However, in cases involving the unauthorized use of a trade secret-that is, where a defendant builds upon a plaintiff's trade secret but does not disseminate it-courts should not presume irreparable harm and, instead, should apply the eBay framework. As part of this assessment, courts should consider policy concerns related to cumulative innovation and employee mobility.",2019,Business & Economics; Government & Law
Sources and Targets for Drug Repurposing: Landscaping Transitions in Therapeutic Space,; INFORMATION; EXTRACTION,"Patent applications provide unique opportunities for landscaping ongoing medical innovation. In this analysis of drug repurposing patent applications published under the international Patent Convention Treaty during the years 2011-2014, we discuss what categories in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases provide drugs and drug candidates for potential second medical uses, and how these proposed repurposed uses relate to each other and the original ones. Also discussed are the geographic origin of the patent assignees and their type and size. Beyond the expected interactions within the field of neuropsychiatry, frequent secondary use claims for oncology compounds to treat noninfectious respiratory diseases, and for cardiovascular compounds to treat neurological conditions, were unexpected findings derived from the repurposing heatmap. The relative absence of repurposing claims to treat parasitic or tropical diseases contrasts sharply with the broad attention this segment receives in the peer-reviewed literature. Equally notable are the dominance of universities and small pharmaceutical companies; a focus of large multinational companies to repurpose their own compounds; and the leading role of European-centered entities among the assignees. We believe that this investigation represents the first comprehensive cross-sectional attempt at mapping drug repurposing patterns across therapeutic fields, and could provide important clues that complement those obtained from the peer-reviewed literature.",2015,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Rethinking Standing in Patent Challenges,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; SETTLEMENT; QUALITY; LAW,"Patents have become a serious business risk They issue from the Patent and Trademark Office in record-breaking quantity and are aggressively enforced by patent trolls. But many patents are likely to be invalid; and even those which are valid are likely to be narrower than their owners claim. Firms investing in innovation would find it desirable to clear their respective fields of invalid or overbroad patents prior to making their investments, and there is great social value in reducing the number of such patents. But the path to determining the validity or scope of issued patents runs through the courts, and in recent years the Federal Circuit has developed special standing rules for patent challengers that allow access to the courts only when it appears that an infringement suit is temporally or legally proximate. In this Article, I criticize this proximity criterion on conceptual, doctrinal, and normative grounds and provide a comprehensive account of standing to challenge the scope and validity of patents. Conceptually, I argue that because patents are a form of regulation, their effects sweep more broadly than the Federal Circuit currently appreciates. When the risk of infringement liability deters business and investment activities, the affected parties can bring a quiet title action to obtain certainty about the validity or scope of adverse patents. I then argue as a doctrinal matter that there is no reason to treat patent challenges differently from other cases. Applying traditional principles of constitutional and prudential standing broadens the range of potential plaintiffs. Finally, I justify this result on normative grounds because the Federal Circuit's restrictive approach creates a misalignment between those who have incentives to challenge patents and those who have access to the courts. Allowing challenges by a broader range of plaintiffs will result in more socially valuable validity litigation.",2015,Government & Law
Foreign R&D satellites as a medium for the international diffusion of knowledge,; DIRECT-INVESTMENT; PATENT CITATIONS; DOMESTIC FIRMS; GEOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; SPILLOVERS; PRODUCTIVITY; MOBILITY; INNOVATION; COUNTRIES; BENEFIT,"I examine the extent to which foreign R&D satellites of multinational firms act as a medium for the international diffusion of knowledge. Using patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, I compare the frequency with which headquarters patents are cited by third-party firms in the satellite's host country relative to a control group of patents, and this both before and after the establishment of the satellite (using a difference-in-differences approach). The results suggest that the satellite increases the flow of knowledge from the multinational's headquarters to firms in the satellite's host country. This satellite effect on knowledge diffusion is largest in host countries and sectors with strong but not world-class capabilities that have both the motivation and absorptive capacity to learn from foreign parties. The findings also suggest that knowledge diffusion is greatest when satellites are staffed with inventors that have previously either patented with other local firms (thus having stronger local social networks) or with the headquarters (thus having headquarters knowledge).",2018,Business & Economics
THE EFFECT OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS ON THE AMERICA INVENTS ACT'S INTER PARTES REVIEW PROCEDURE,; ,"In 2011, Congress created a new administrative pathway through which a party can challenge the validity of a granted patent: inter parses review (IPR). Like preexisting reexamination procedures, IPR is a mechanism through which a private party may ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to invalidate or narrow patents that fail to meet the standards of patent eligibility, thus returning subject matter to the public domain and protecting would-be patent infringers from the threat of costly infringement litigation. However, unlike the preexisting procedures, which were essentially extensions of the patent review process involving a back-and-forth between the PTO and the patent holder, IPR is adversarial in nature-an IPR is essentially a minitrial between a challenger and a patentee. Because the new IPR procedure closely resembles litigation between private parties, it may be possible for patent licensees to contract away their right to petition for IPR through arbitration agreements. And because patent licensees may often be the parties most incentivized and prepared to challenge bad patents through IPR, patent owners who can contractually prevent these licensees from using IPR will be able to minimize or even entirely avoid exposure to the risky and challenger-friendly new IPR procedure. The enforceability of an arbitration agreement purporting to prevent a licensee from petitioning for IPR is unclear. This Note explores this doctrinal ambiguity and questions whether applying the strong federal policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution to this issue would undermine the congressional intent behind Congress's new IPR procedure.",2018,Government & Law
Putting the 'private' into the 'private and non-commercial use' exception in patent law: what does it really mean?,TRIPS; Article 30; 3-step test; ,"Patent-protected research and development in the food industry is important but comes at a high cost. This cost may result in smallholding or subsistence farmers being denied the benefits of genetically-modified seed. One option for farmers might be to exploit the 'private and non-commercial use' exception found within patent law. 'Exceptions' to inventor rights, a legal mechanism to balance an inventor's 'monopoly' rights with enhanced user access, provide 'safe harbours' that allow users to utilize a patented product in a manner that would normally be considered infringing. To be legally valid, an exception must satisfy the '3-Step Test' of Article 30 the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Article 30 permits 'limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.' The 'private and non-commercial use' exception is intended to protect infringing but de minimis activity. This exception is found in most World Trade Organization (WTO) countries although the formulation varies from country to country. Some countries have implemented the 'private and non-commercial use' exception through their reading of the patent grant, while others have specifically legislated the exception. The use of different terms within the exception such as 'non-profit,' 'non-industrial', etc., and whether they are used in a conjunctive or disjunctive manner will determine the scope of each formulation. This paper focuses on the 'private' component of the exception and considers whether the various national formulations and interpretations of the term would satisfy the Article 30 3-Step Test, and whether this exception actually provides a useful means of providing smallholding and subsistence farmers with access to modified seed.",2019,Agriculture; Business & Economics; Public Administration

To date, there are six available different drug classes for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension: beta-adrenergic antagonists, prostaglandins, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha 2-selective adrenergic, muscarinic agonists and rho kinase inhibitors, which act by reducing the production or increasing the drainage of aqueous humor. Areas covered: This manuscript reviews patent US2018244666A1, that describes the synthesis of novel potential rho kinase and monoamine transporters inhibitors with a benzamide or isoquinoline amide scaffolds, and patent US2018256595A1 that investigates the long-term treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension with ripasudil, a rho kinase inhibitor. Expert opinion: A variety of netarsudil congeners were synthesized as rho kinases inhibitors in patent US2018244666A1. Results of patent US2018256595A1 showed that ripasudil is among the best candidates for glaucoma long-term treatment, as IOP continuously dropped over the course of the treatment.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Standard essential patents - a comparison of approaches between East and West,SEP; SSO; FRAND; competition law; new economy; IP; comparative law; COMPETITION LAW; HUAWEI; FRAND; AGREEMENTS,"The rapid development of the 'New Economy' on a global scale has brought new issues of competition law, one of them concerning the licensing of standard essential patents (SEPs). Standardization allows interoperability and compatibility and thus enhances not only static but also dynamic efficiency. However, the procedures in standard setting organizations (SSOs) may not be used to unduly restrict competition. In Asia, for example, most competition regimes have highlighted their focus on fair and free competition, making clear that the field of SEP is no exception. Recently, the competition authorities in Korea and China have concluded that a breach of 'fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND)' commitments may constitute violations of their competition rules, apparently taking inspiration from the case law in the EU. Therefore, it seems overdue to look at recent developments in competition law and policies on SEP and FRAND worldwide and to enquire into the divergence and convergence of competition law in selected jurisdictions. Despite considerable differences, a common feature of all competition regimes discussed in this article is that their goal is to keep markets in the information and communication technology sector as open as possible, including - and especially - with respect to standard-setting procedures.",2018,Government & Law
REGULATING SECRECY,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PRICE-COMPETITION; TRADE SECRETS; DRUGS; LIFE; BIOSIMILARS; PATENTS; HOLD; ACT,"Inventors face a stark choice between two intellectual property systems of protecting innovative ideas: patents and trade secrecy. But accounts of this choice underexplore the role of the regulators that dominate some areas of innovation. Regulation interacts with intellectual property exclusivity in socially problematic ways by encouraging secrecy at the expense of innovation, efficiency, and competition. This Article theorizes how regulation empowers intellectual property generally, explains why this strengthening is problematic for trade secrecy but not for patents, and offers the solution of regulator-enforced disclosure. When a fegulator defines a product or a process, it becomes much harder to successfully commercialize minor variations on that product or process. Any associated intellectual property exclusivity thus gets much more powerful. When the FDA approves a new drug, patents covering that chemical become much costlier to invent around because similar but non-identical chemicals lack the tremendous benefit of FDA approval. This interaction between patents and regulation interaction, however, can be noted and explicitly addressed by policy. The Hatch-Waxman Act, for example, facilitates generic drug entry once drug patents expire. Regulation strengthens trade secrecy too, but more problematically. Biologics, which comprise the most innovative and expensive drugs today, are the path-dependent result of complex, secret manufacturing processes. Meeting the FDA's definition of a biologic requires reverse-engineering its complex, secret process, making trade secrecy much more valuable, but stifling competition and innovation. In such situations, regulation can push firms to choose secrecy over patents in precisely those socially important industries, like drugs, medical devices, and pesticides, where disclosure is most important. Where regulation creates problems, however, it also offers the hope of a solution. Regulators are in a strong position to require disclosure directly: regulated firms have strong incentives for candor, regulators have the necessary expertise, and regulatory incentives can offset the costs of disclosure. More effective regulator-mediated disclosure would increase oversight and enable cumulative innovation, while retaining incentives for invention in regulated industries.",2016,Government & Law
Inherent Anticipation in the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industries,; ,"Pharmaceutical and biotech research often involves discovering new properties of, or new methods to use, existing compositions. The doctrine of inherent anticipation, however, prevents the issuance and/or validity of a patent for discoveries deemed to have been implicitly disclosed in the prior art. This can be a barrier to patent rights in these technologies. Inherent anticipation therefore creates uncertainty for patent protection in the pharmaceutical and biotech sciences. Despite this uncertainty, Federal Circuit jurisprudence provides guidance on the boundaries of the inherent anticipation doctrine. In view of the case law, certain strategies may be employed to protect inventions that may potentially be viewed as inherent in the prior art.",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine
Constraints on gene patent protection fuel secrecy concerns: a qualitative study,genetics; innovation; intellectual property; patents; qualitative research; trade secrets; LAW,"Concern is mounting that innovators are responding to recent changes in patent eligibility by increasingly choosing to protect their discoveries as trade secrets. Due to the clandestine nature of trade secrets, it is impossible to quantify the extent to which innovators actually elect to protect their inventions as trade secrets rather than patents. Nevertheless, interest in each strategy may be gauged through qualitative means. We conducted semi-structured interviews of legal and scientific experts (n = 30) to understand the effect of recent patent eligibility changes on interest in patenting and trade secrecy of genetic innovations. Interview data indicate that secrecy may have increased in strategic appeal relative to patent protection in some areas of genetic innovation, although the actual election of secrecy strategies is often limited as a practical matter. The data also suggest that the burden of navigating the new intellectual property landscapemay be falling disproportionately on those who translate gene-based discoveries into clinical applications. Some interviewees expressed concern about the normative implications of secrecy on advancements in and access to genetic medicine. Our findings are potentially relevant to policy proposals intended to restore some of the legal protection that was lost as a result of recent changes to patent eligibility, including amending the federal patent statute and expanding regulatory exclusivities for some genetic technologies.",2017,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine
Mylan Institutional LLC v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.,; ,"In the decision below, the district court granted a preliminary injunction in an ANDA case based on the likelihood that the accused product would infringe process patents directed to processes for purifying the product, and a product patent claiming the product compound at a purity greater than 99%. On appeal, the Federal Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction, finding the district court had not erred with respect to its finding that the product patent was likely infringed and not invalid, and that absent the injunction the patent owner would suffer irreparable harm. However, the appellate court modified the grant of preliminary injunction, premising it only on the lower court's evaluation of the product patent. The Federal Circuit held that a substantial question remained concerning the infringement of the process patents, because the district court had abused its discretion in finding these patents likely to be infringed under the doctrine of equivalents. This decision provides an instructive tutorial on the proper application of the doctrine of equivalents in chemical cases, with the court noting that the law on the doctrine of equivalents as applied to chemical materials is not clear, and its misapplication can lead to unsound results. This appears to be such a case.''",2017,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology
Developing a Methodology of Structuring and Layering Technological Information in Patent Documents through Natural Language Processing,text mining; NLP; technological information; patent analysis; text structure; TRENDS,"Since patents contain various types of objective technological information, they are used to identify the characteristics of technology fields. Text mining in patent analysis is employed in various fields such as trend analysis and technology classification, and knowledge flow among technologies. However, since keyword-based text mining has the limitation whereby, when screening useful keywords, it frequently omits meaningful keywords, analyzers therefore need to repeat the careful scrutiny of the derived keywords to clarify the meaning of keywords. In this research, we structure meaningful keyword sets related to technological information from patent documents; then we layer the keywords, depending on the level of information. This research involves two steps. First, the characteristics of technological information are analyzed by reviewing the patent law and investigating the description of patent documents. Second, the technological information is structured by considering the information types, and the keywords in each type are layered through natural language processing. Consequently, the structured and layered keyword set does not omit useful keywords and the analyzer can easily understand the meaning of each keyword.",2017,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
Trust: A Model for Disclosure in Patent Law,; WOMEN INVENTORS; PRIVACY; TIES; PROPERTY; STRENGTH,"How to draw the line between public and private is a foundational, first principles question of privacy law, but the answer has implications for intellectual property, as well. This project is one in a series of papers about first-person disclosures of information in the privacy and intellectual property law contexts, and it defines the bound-ary between public and nonpublic information through the lens of social science -namely, principles of trust. Patent law's public use bar confronts the question of whether legal protection should extend to information previously disclosed to a small group of people. I present evidence that shows that current application of the public use bar privileges the confidentiality and control norms of industry while minimizing those no less strong norms common to lone entrepreneurs. This results in a general pattern: corporate inventors tend to win their public use cases; solo entrepreneurs tend to lose them. As a result, the public use bar has unintended negative effects, including discouraging experimentation and discriminating against inventors without the financial backing of corporate employers. These results are the direct effects of how courts determine the difference between public and nonpublic uses. This project proposes a new way of talking about, thinking through, and determining when previous disclosures bar subsequent patentability. In short, I argue that invention disclosures in contexts of trust retain their legal protection despite any ostensible loss of control or lack of formal confidentiality agreements. This proposal respects social network differences and will advance the goals of patent law and increase access to the innovation economy for all persons.",2017,Government & Law

Design/methodology/approach - The authors' cross-checked information regarding the names of all inventors with Brazilian addresses in PCT patent applications in the Espacenet database with the names of researchers in the CVs available on the Lattes Platform of CNPq. The analysis specifically focussed on patent applications published in the PCT with Brazilian priority for the 2002-2012 period. Findings - It was found that the Brazilian academic patents concentrate on science-based technology areas, especially in the Pharma Biotechnology domain. For a total of 466 patent applications with Brazilian priority in this field, 233 have academic inventors. Of those 233 academic applications, 66.1 per cent have universities as their owners, while the remaining 33.9 per cent are not owned by universities. Further, it was found that there are more Brazilian academic patents in the biotechnology sub-domain than those filed by the business sector. Research limitations/implications - This research was based on the intersection of patent databases and the content available on the official curriculum base of Brazil (Lattes Platform, CNPq). Once the curricula information are voluntary, there are risks inherent reliability of this information. Practical implications - This study allows us to identify more accurately which is the effective role of the Brazilian Academy in patents generation, revealing that a significant unaccounted deposits with personal inventors or companies' ownership really have a academic contribution. Originality/value - This paper shows that the academic sector plays a key role in Brazil's international patenting activity, particularly in science-intensive technology domains, and it highlights the specific contribution of academic patents not owned by universities.",2017,Business & Economics

First, we use regression models to investigate those factors that act as potential drivers when considering papers and patents individually. Second, we run a cluster analysis in order to test whether universities follow different patterns in the way they align their resources in regard to research objectives. The empirical application considers the Spanish public higher education system for the period 2006-2010. The overarching conclusion is that cross-fertilisation relationships between academic research and its commercialisation are found. There are, however, important differences in how universities are disseminating research results, particularly when we analyse the resources and capabilities universities possess. Results also stress the need to look at contextual and normative factors.",2015,Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics
Sustainability or Colonialism? Legislative obstacles to research and development of natural products and patents on traditional knowledge in Brazil,community-based conservation; ecosystem management; ethics; human rights; politics and policy; DISCOVERY; PLANTS,"Historically, developed countries have benefited from the biodiversity and traditional knowledge of developing countries. Since the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was approved, the world-view regarding access to biological resources has changed. This change marked the introduction of legal agreements regarding access to genetic resources, traditional knowledge and benefit sharing, seeking a fair return for owners and local communities. Unfortunately, as with most national laws, these legal devices complicated collection programs and research initiatives, and diminished the emphasis on the discovery of natural products. There remains a lack of discussion on the establishment of a fair international market value for the access to genetic resources. While Brazil still has advantages and opportunities in this arena, the issue sets barriers for research and development. The protective measures are being reviewed in the project bill 7735/2014, which brings improvements, yet it is still controversial. For this short communication we consulted journals, conference proceedings, as well as scientific and journalistic magazines to report some of the disastrous consequences of the implementation of national laws regarding CBD. We suggest a new focus for decision-making policies based on more efficient field inspections, the empowerment of traditional communities and further associated research in order to ensure the claims of CBD as well as to ratify the Nagoya Protocol.",2015,Plant Sciences
Federal funding and the rate and direction of inventive activity,Patents; Government funding; Research & development; Measurement; Breakthrough innovations; Funding mechanisms; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; BAYH-DOLE ACT; PATENT CITATIONS; ACADEMIC RESEARCH; KNOWLEDGE FLOWS; TECHNOLOGY; BOOTSTRAP,"Leveraging a new measure of patent citation trees (Corredoira and Banerjee, 2015), we demonstrate that research funded by the federal government is associated with more active and diverse technological trajectories. Our findings tie government funding to breakthrough inventions. The differences are especially evident at the upper percentiles of the distribution of long term patent influence and stem primarily from research conducted outside the federal government and sponsored by the DOD, HHS and NSF. Government funded patents are inputs into a broader range of technologies. Additional analyses indicate that federal programs invest in some technological areas that private corporations eschew, and federally funded university patents are in different technological classes than non-federally funded university patents. In this sense, the government may play an irreplaceable role in the rate and direction of inventive activity. Generally speaking, the scientific agencies of Government are not so concerned with immediate practical objectives as are the laboratories of industry nor, on the other hand, are they as free to explore any natural phenomena without regard to possible economic applications as are the educational and private research institutions. - Vannevar Bush, Science the Endless Frontier, 1945.",2018,Business & Economics
Making patents work: of IP duties and deficient disclosures,compulsory licensing; Indian Patents Act 1970; patents; public interest litigation; ,"The Indian patent regime has been celebrated and censured in equal measure: celebrated by those that see in it the vestiges of a past, where nations could craft a patent policy to suit national priorities - without succumbing to the pressures of a global patent script and dictated largely by the industrial interests of the developed world - and censured by those who think that India's extensive use of TRIPS flexibilities to advance developmental priorities comes at the cost of global innovation incentives and a uniform patent paradigm. Indeed, the present frame of the Indian patent regime contains a unique set of provisions not ordinarily found in other regimes. Patent working is one such provision. While most patent regimes demand 'disclosure', in that the patentee must elaborate the invention in full so as to educate the public and enable those skilled in the art to replicate it with relative ease, the Indian patent regime goes one step further. It requires that the disclosure even extend to the mode and manner in which patents are being worked for the greater public good. This information can then be used to trigger compulsory licences and even patent revocations. To this extent, the Indian patent regime not only grants exclusive IP rights, but also imposes a set of IP duties. As an IP duty, patent working is central to the innovation ecosystem, for its disclosure helps foster greater transparency by inter alia pegging specific patents to products. This information is particularly valuable in the high technology sector, where it is often impossible to co-relate patents and the technological products that embody them, and vice versa. Unfortunately, Indian patentees routinely flout this important legal tenet, and the government has all but turned a blind eye to it. This paper reflects on this important statutory mandate and its jurisprudential underpinnings, particularly in relation to two technology sectors: pharmaceuticals and high technology (IT and telecommunications). It highlights a writ petition filed by the author of this paper to showcase the sheer callousness with which the patent working requirement has been treated by both patentees and the government alike. It then discusses the ways in which the mandate could be strengthened so as to pave the way for a more meaningful patent regime and a more transparent innovation ecosystem.",2017,Government & Law

"Private Law, Conflict of Laws, and a Lex Mercatoria of Standards-Development Organizations",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ANTITRUST,"Technical standards created by industry standards-development organizations (SDOs) enable interoperability among products manufactured by different vendors. Over the years, SDOs have developed policies to reduce the risk that SDO participants holding patents covering the SDO's standards will disrupt or hinder the development and deployment of these standards. These policies, including commitments to license standardsessential patents (SEPs) on terms that are fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND), gain transnational application given the international character of SDO activities and are most effectively interpreted and applied on the basis of private law (contractual) principles. However, SDO policies are typically embodied in an SDO's governing documents, which are in turn regulated by the law of the jurisdiction in which the SDO is based. This somewhat arbitrary linkage of SDO policies to national and state law has created inconsistencies in their interpretation and threatens to spark jurisdictional competition in an unproductive race to the bottom. This article poses the question whether it would be possible to decouple SDO policy interpretation from the patchwork of national and state laws that purport to govern such policies in favour of a common lexicon of interpretive principles derived from the shared understanding of SDO participants: a 'lex mercatoria' of standardization.",2019,Government & Law

"Nat. Alternatives Int'l, Inc. v. Creative Compounds, LLC United States Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit, 2019 918 F.3d 1338",; ,"Natural Alternatives owns a number of patents generally relating to the use of beta-alanine in a dietary supplement to increas[e] the anaerobic working capacity of muscle and other tissue.'' The district court held the asserted claims not patent eligible on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, but on appeal the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded because Creative Compounds had failed to demonstrate under Natural Alternatives' proposed claim constructions that the claims are not patent eligible. The patent claims at issue fall into three categories: Method Claims, Product Claims, and Manufacturing Claims. The district court found the Method Claims to be directed to natural laws, but the Federal Circuit disagreed, finding them to be patent eligible method of treatment claims similar to the claim found patent eligible in Vanda Pharmaceuticals. Similarly, while the district court held that the Product Claims are directed to the patent ineligible natural phenomena of beta- alanine and/or glycine, the Federal Circuit found the claims to be directed to specific treatment formulations that incorporate natural products that, according to the patentee's pleadings, have synergistic effect, unlike the mixture of naturally occurring bacteria found to be unpatentable in Funk Brothers. Finally, the Federal Circuit found the Manufacturing Claims to be directed to the manufacture of a human dietary supplement with certain characteristics, and thus even further removed from the natural law and product of nature at issue in the Method Claims and Product Claims, respectively. Judge Reyna dissented from the majority's broad stroke of eligibility,'' primarily based on his conclusion that the majority had relied on an erroneous construction of the claims. He went on to question whether the time has come for this court to reconsider whether a Rule 12(c) motion to dismiss based on 101 should be decided before claim construction.",2019,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

However, while international IP systems have radically transformed after the implementation of the TRIPS agreement, these contextual changes have not been accounted for in existing international management research approaches. This study examines the institutional context of IP systems in the post TRIPS implementation years by conceptualizing how IP Law on the books (regulations) and IP Law in practice (enforcement) combine. This enables the identification of two new contextual categories of IP systems that have not been conceptually, theoretically, or empirically captured in existing international management research. A review of the existing literature on indices measuring different aspects of national IP systems provides insights into how to improve future theoretical and empirical international management work that aims to study the effects of the context of IP systems in the post TRIPS era.",2019,Business & Economics
WILL DELAWARE BE DIFFERENT? AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF TC HEARTLAND AND THE SHIFT TO DEFENDANT CHOICE OF VENUE,; CORPORATE-LAW; STATE COMPETITION; NEW-YORK; BANKRUPTCY; FEDERALISM; LITIGATION; FAILURE; ISSUES; RACE,"Why do some venues evolve into litigation havens while others do not? Venues might compete for litigation for various reasons, like enhancing their judges' prestige and increasing revenues for the local bar. This competition is framed by the party that chooses the venue. Whether plaintiffs or defendants primarily choose venue is crucial because, we argue, the two scenarios are not symmetrical. The Supreme Court's recent decision in TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods LLC illustrates this dynamic. There, the Court effectively shifted venue choice in many patent infringement cases from plaintiffs to corporate defendants. We use TC Heartland to empirically measure the impact of this shift using an event study, which measures how the stock market reacted to the decision. We find that likely targets of patent trolls-entities that own and assert patented inventions but do not otherwise use them-saw their company valuations increase the most due to TC Heartland. This effect is particularly pronounced for Delaware-incorporated firms. Our results match litigation trends since TC Heartland, as new cases have dramatically shifted to the District of Delaware from the Eastern District of Texas, previously the most popular venue for infringement actions. Why do investors believe Delaware will do better than Texas in curbing patent-troll litigation? Unlike Texas, Delaware's economy depends on attracting large businesses that pay high incorporation fees; it is thus less likely to encourage disruptive litigation and jeopardize its privileged position in corporate law. More broadly, we explain why giving defendants more control over venue can counterbalance judges' incentives to increase their influence by encouraging excessive litigation. Drawing on Delaware's approach to corporate litigation and bankruptcy proceedings, we argue that Delaware will compete for patent litigation through an expert judiciary and well-developed case law that balances both patentee and defendant interests.",2018,Government & Law
CONFIDENTIALITY IN PATENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION: ANTITRUST IMPLICATIONS,; SETTLEMENT; PRICE,"Information is crucial to the functioning of the patent system, as it is for other markets. Nevertheless, patent licensing terms are often subject to confidentiality agreements. On the one hand, this is not surprising: sellers and buyers do not normally publicize the details of their transactions. On the other hand, explicit confidentiality agreements are not common in other markets, and they may be particularly problematic for patents. Several United States Supreme Court cases have condemned agreements that suppress market information, and those cases could be applied to confidentiality agreements in the patent context. Of course, confidentiality may sometimes be pro-competitive, particularly when it involves only private negotiations. In other contexts, however, and notably in arbitration, which is a substitute for open court proceedings, the competitive balance is more problematic. Indeed, U.S. patent law mandates that patent arbitration awards be made public through the Patent and Trademark Office, though this requirement is generally ignored. Information about licensing terms is particularly important in one of today's most important patent licensing contexts. The standard-setting organizations that define the technologies used in products like smartphones typically require their members to commit to license patented technologies that are adopted in standards on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms. The non-discriminatory element of this commitment is difficult for potential licensees to enforce without information about the licensing terms to which other licensees have agreed. This Article describes the value of patent licensing information and discusses the antitrust implications of agreements to keep that information confidential, particularly in the FRAND context and in arbitration. The Article also offers several ways in which parties, standard setting organizations, and arbitration bodies could seek to avoid the anticompetitive effects of confidentiality.",2018,Government & Law
Patents on Medical Innovations and Value Pluralism in India: Paradoxes and Choices,Patents; Value Pluralism; Evergreening; Ordre Public; Open Source; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ANTICOMMONS; TRAGEDY; SYSTEM,"Patent as a rewarding system to the inventor has been in vogue for more than six hundred years. This has resulted in major innovations that have revolutionised our lives besides saving millions of lives and eradicating deadly diseases. But over the years the corporations rather than scientists or technocrats have become the claimants and owners of patents. In the process the balance between incentivisation and patenting for control has been lost and this has resulted in major questions on the objectives and functioning of the intellectual property rights regimes, particularly in the case of drugs and pharmaceuticals. In this paper the idea of value pluralism is used to develop an alternative perspective and it is illustrated with two case studies. It is contended that this approach is suitable for countries like India. It is important to explore the alternatives like Prizes, Open Source Drug Discovery and other ideas that seek to overcome the problems with the patent law and practice. Since patents on medical innovations is also an issue of access and affordability to life saving drugs, devices and treatments, a narrow view on patents and innovation is not sufficient. This paper examines the values and choices before the society and calls for a rethinking in our approach to invention and incentivisation.",2019,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology
Investor perception and business method patents: A natural experiment,Business method patent; Innovation; Policy; Intellectual property; Empirical study; Court case; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION; LESSONS; COSTS; SCOPE,"The 1998 State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group court case is largely responsible for opening the door on the issuance of business method patents, while the 2008, in re Bilski decision closed it (at least partially) once again. The result of the first decision was a significant increase in the number of patents issued and law suits filed for infringement. This paper is the first the authors are aware of to utilize these court cases as natural experiments to gauge investor belief regarding the utility of business method patents on publicly traded companies. We find that investor beliefs about the effect of business method patents on company value evolved between 1998 and 2008, as investors modified their expectations for the effects of the in re Bilski decision based on what actually occurred after the State Street decision. We also find that investor sentiment varied by industry subsector. Our findings offer insights into the ongoing debate over the utility of business method patents, which may inform managers, investors, and both statutory and regulatory policy makers.

ATTACKING INNOVATION,; PATENT-LAW; INCENTIVES; CHALLENGES; ANTITRUST; TAXATION,"Economists generally agree that innovation is important to economic growth and that government support for innovation is necessary. Historically, the U.S. government has supported innovation in a variety of ways: (1) a strong legal system for patents; (2) direct support through research performed by government agencies, grants, loans, and loan guarantees; and (3) indirect support through various tax incentives for private firms. In recent years, however, we have seen a weakening of the U.S. patent system, a decline in direct funding of research, and a weakening of tax policy tools used to encourage new innovation. These disruptive changes threaten the future of innovation in the United States, potentially driving innovation activities offshore to Europe and China. This Article concludes that the current innovation crisis demands changes to both the patent and tax systems in order to instill confidence in the innovation landscape.",2019,Government & Law
THE ACTAVIS INFERENCE: THEORY AND PRACTICE,; PATENT SETTLEMENT,"In FTC v. Actavis, Inc., the Supreme Court considered reverse payment settlements of patent infringement litigation. In such a settlement, a patentee pays the alleged infringer to settle, and the alleged infringer agrees not to enter the market for a period of time. The Court held that a reverse payment settlement violates antitrust law if the patentee is paying to avoid competition. The core insight of Actavis is the Actavis Inference: a large and otherwise unexplained payment, combined with delayed entry, supports a reasonable inference of harm to consumers from lessened competition. This paper is an effort to assist courts and counsel in implementing the Actavis Inference. First, we evaluate a variety of fact patterns that have arisen in the district courts since Actavis, including payment that takes a form other than cash. For example, a branded drug maker may promise not to offer an authorized generic drug. As we explain, under Actavis, such agreements are especially likely to violate antitrust law. We also consider how much detail a plaintiff must offer in its initial complaint to comply with federal pleading requirements. Second, we demonstrate that the Actavis Inference fully applies when multiple generic firms, rather than just one, threaten to enter the market. Our economic model shows that the Actavis Inference becomes stronger and more important in the presence of multiple generic firms. Our analysis demonstrates that the contrary conclusions reached in a recent paper by Bruce Kobayashi, Joshua Wright, Douglas Ginsburg, and Joanna Tsai (KWGT) are incorrect, inconsistent with KWGT's own analysis, or irrelevant to a faithful implementation of Actavis. Third, we clarify the reasons not to litigate patents in antitrust cases. Thanks to the Actavis Inference, a trial court need not determine patent validity or infringement in order to assess the legality of the settlement. The antitrust question depends upon the ex ante prospects in patent litigation and not ex post litigation of the patent by a patent court or by the antitrust court considering the settlement. Litigating the patent is thus of limited probative value and not dispositive regarding a potential antitrust violation.",2015,Government & Law
A MARKET TEST FOR BAYH-DOLE PATENTS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PUBLIC RESEARCH; INCENTIVES; UNIVERSITIES; RIGHTS; ACT; INVENTIONS; DISCOVERY; GROWTH; NORMS,"The Bayh-Dole Act, which allows patenting of federally funded research, has been praised for driving growth but also criticized for creating unnecessary deadweight loss and contributing to a patent anticommons. Much of the controversy stems from Bayh-Dole's differing effects on different inventions. The dominant justification for Bayh-Dole patents is commercialization theory: the idea that exclusive rights are necessary to bring inventions to market. This theory is convincing for inventions like pharmaceuticals with high regulatory barriers and low imitation costs, but not when exclusivity is unnecessary for commercialization, such as for Stanford's widely licensed patents on early recombinant DNA technology. The problem is that for many government-funded inventions it is difficult to determine whether exclusive patent grants are necessary to incentivize commercialization. To solve this difficulty, we propose a market test for federally funded inventions at universities and other nonprofits. Before charging significant licensing fees for these inventions, these federal grant recipients would first be required to find out whether firms would be willing to commercialize the invention in exchange for a nonexclusive license with a nominal fee. If a company is willing to commit to developing the invention under a nonexclusive license, then an exclusive license or a nonexclusive license with high fees would be contrary to the public interest. More generally, using a formal economic model, we show that deadweight loss can be reduced through an auction that forces bidders to reveal the least amount of exclusivity needed to induce commercialization, that revenue cap bidding is more efficient than duration bidding, and that defensive bidding by firms that consume as well as produce the invention will not increase deadweight loss. We discuss how the market test requirement could be structured and how due diligence milestones and other provisions could be used to discourage gaming.",2017,Government & Law

A wealth of research points towards a complex blend of factors, including organizational antecedents, social norms and personal-level expectations. Few studies, however, have attempted to investigate the effect of concrete incentives from the perspective of individual scientists' decision-making. In this paper, we operationalize the propensity to patent and commercialize research results as the intention to submit an invention disclosure filing. We use scenario-based conjoint analysis to capture university scientists' preference structures for different incentive policies. Results indicate that direct and indirect financial incentives are dominant drivers. In addition, a grace period that would allow for patenting and publishing in parallel and the inclusion of patents in academic performance assessments are worth considering, whereas the specific setup of the technology transfer organization and public recognition of achievements in form of an award appear to have limited effect. However, preferences for incentives and hence their effectiveness vary significantly across academic disciplines and ranks as well as with scientists' working experience, patenting experience and research orientation. On this basis, we can derive more qualified recommendations for incentive system design.",2018,Engineering; Business & Economics
Optimal patent length and breadth in an R&D driven market with evolving consumer preferences: An evolutionary multi-agent based modeling approach,Patent; Industrial dynamics; Agent-based modeling; QUALITY LADDERS; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; POLICY; SCOPE; APPROPRIABILITY; PATENTABILITY; LESSONS; RATES; SIZE,"The aims of this paper are twofold. The first is to analyze the interaction between R&D activities of firms and heterogeneous consumer preferences in structuring the evolution of an industry. The second is to explore the effects of patent length and breadth on market outcomes. To answer these research questions, an evolutionary, multi agent based, sector-level cumulative innovation model is designed. The model addresses supply and demand side of the market simultaneously with the coevolution of heterogeneous consumer preferences, heterogeneous firm knowledge bases and technology levels at the micro level. Firms compete on quality and price of their products in an oligopolistic market whereas consumers, constrained by their computational limits, act to maximize their utility with their product choices in a boundedly rational way. There is continuous firm entry and exit depending on the competitive performance of the firms. The simulation analysis concludes that patent length has a continuous effect on market outcomes whereas patent breadth has a discontinuous effect and the optimum patent policy is a 'mild' one with broad patents for a limited period of time to maximize technological progress and total welfare.

Here we evaluated the usefulness of MDCTA to determine the cause of acute multiple brain infarction (AMBI). Methods: AMBI was defined as multiple recent infarcts demonstrated on diffusion-weighted imaging. A new infarction within 2 weeks from the last was also considered an AMBI. Results: Between January 2012 and December 2013, 967 patients were diagnosed with acute brain infarction and 138 (14.3%) with AMBI. Among them, 57 (39 men and 18 women; age, 38-93 years) were examined by MDCTA using the dual-phase method. All images were diagnostic, even if patients found it difficult to hold their breath. Fifteen patients (26.3%) were diagnosed with patent foramen ovale (PFO). Two had complications of atrial fibrillation (AF), necessitating anticoagulant therapy (ACT). Four had both PFO and severe aortic atherosclerotic plaque formation, necessitating single antiplatelet therapy (APT) and/or ACT. Fifteen patients (26.3%) developed complicated arterial plaques around the aortic arch and were administered single or dual APT and/or ACT, except 1 patient with a history of multiple cerebral bleeding. Nine patients had pre-existing AF. Furthermore, ACT was initiated for 2 other patients with thrombus or circulatory stasis in the left atrial appendage despite normal electrocardiographic findings. Two other patients were diagnosed with advanced cancer, which was considered Trousseau syndrome. The cause of AMBI was determined in 36 (63.2%) patients. Conclusions: MDCTA is a useful and less invasive method to identify the cause of embolic infarction.",2015,Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
The Trade Secret-Contract Interface,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; SILICON VALLEY; FAIR-USE; LAW; PREEMPTION; COPYRIGHT; PATENT; AGREEMENTS; INNOVATION; FREEDOM,"Contracts play a dual and dueling role in trade secret law. On the one hand, non-disclosure contracts serve an important evidentiary role, helping owners prove key elements of a trade secret claim (e.g., reasonable secrecy efforts). Because of this evidentiary role, trade secret owners routinely use confidentiality contracts when sharing information with employees, business collaborators, and consumers. This Article suggests that contracts have a pivotal evidentiary role in trade secret cases because of their notice function. Unlike patent law, trade secret law does not impose formal application or disclosure requirements on putative owners. Thus, nondisclosure contracts are one of the few ways to not recipients of information about the existence and scope of claimed trade secrets. Contracts' centrality to trade secret law can create doctrinal tension, however, when owners draft provisions to evade trade secret law's requirements and limitations. For example, trade secret owners impose contract provisions that prohibit reverse engineering, avoid ongoing secrecy precautions, prevent the use of non -secret or publicly available information, and incorporate employee non-compete clauses. Such provisions conflict with trade secret law, but owners can nonetheless enforce them through breach of contract claims. The pervasive use of contract law to evade trade secret limitations can undermine important policy concerns, such as promoting cumulative innovation and protecting employee mobility. This Article offers the first comprehensive account of trade secret law's uniquely co-dependent yet complicated relationship with contract law. I consider various legal mechanisms to strengthen the ex ante notice function of contracts and deter uses of contract that pose particular risks to trade secret law's underlying policy concerns.",2018,Government & Law
Commercialization of university inventions: Individual and institutional factors affecting licensing of university patents,University invention; Research commercialization; Licensing; Patent; BAYH-DOLE ACT; PUBLIC RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; UNITED-STATES; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LIFE SCIENCES; ACADEMIC RESEARCH; INDUSTRY; KNOWLEDGE; GROWTH,"This paper conducts a unique study using the university patent as the unit of analysis to determine how individual and institutional factors affect the likelihood that a patent will be licensed. Using a 2010 national survey of academic scientists in the United States in which respondents were asked specific questions about 2006 patents for which they were listed as inventors, we find that the likelihood of licensing is significantly determined by individual factors including inventors' attitude towards commercialization of research, additional research conducted during patent review, and collaboration with industry scientists on the underlying research. Among institutional factors, university Technology Transfer Office's cost-saving measures positively influence licensing, but industry funding and TTO service effectiveness do not. We also identify two types of inventions: opportunity-based inventions are discoveries that are not foreseen patentable at the outset of projects; intention-based inventions occur on research projects that anticipate commercial outcomes before the start of research. Findings demonstrate that different individual and institutional factors contribute to licensing of these two different inventions. This study provides new insights into the process of commercialization of university inventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It aims at providing a picture of how legal, structural and policy-related divergences and convergences between both domains influence the achievement of environmental goals. The difficulties in pursuing climate change mitigation objectives are often attributable to the exclusivity of patent rights, resulting in unavailability of needed technologies. Patent law, as one of the elements of the climate change mitigation scenario, if supported by an adequate regulatory framework and effectively employed within the context of the climate change normative structure (the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol), can contribute to achieving mitigation and adaptation goals.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Workers and technological change in the United States,Technological change; labor laws; worker power; inequality; PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH; MECHANIZATION; LABOR,"In this paper, we put forward a theoretical framework for understanding a positive relationship between labor laws and innovation and rigorously test it against both historical and empirical data. We show how several periods in the economic history of the United States - like the increase in slave-field hand productivity in cotton picking in the Antebellum South, the transition in the North from artisanal shops to nonmechanized factories, the increase in productivity in mechanized textile factories in the Northeast in the late Antebellum period, and the increase in productivity in sharecropping after the Civil War - can be understood, at least partially, through our theoretical framework. To build further support for the framework, we empirically analyze how change in labor laws during the early twentieth century affected patent issuance by state. And we also look at how changes in worker power, as proxied by strike activity, affected patent issuance by industry between the early twentieth century and 1980.",2018,History; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics
WHY DO STARTUPS USE TRADE SECRETS?,; BIG SECRETS; PATENTS; PROTECTION; MECHANISMS; INNOVATION; APPROPRIATION; STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE; ECONOMICS; VENTURES,"Empirical studies of the use of trade secrecy are scant, and those focusing on startups, nonexistent. In this Article, we present the first set of data-drawn from the Berkeley Patent Survey-on the use of trade secrets by U.S. startup companies in the software, biotechnology, medical device, and hardware industries. Specifically, we report on the prevalence of trade secrecy usage among startups. Additionally, we assess the importance of trade secrets in relation to other forms of intellectual property protection and barriers to entry, such as patents, copyrights, first-mover advantage, and complementary assets. We segment these results by a variety of factors, including industry, company business model, overall revenue, patenting propensity, funding sources, innovation types, and licensing. From this segmentation, we implement a basic regression model and report on those factors showing a statistically significant relationship in the use of trade secrets by startups. Our results point to three major findings. First, trade secrecy serves other important aims aside from first-mover advantage. Second, trade secrets may act both as economic complements and substitutes to patenting. Third, trade secrets may serve as important strategic assets, functioning much in the same manner as patents in terms of licensing and setting the boundaries of the firm.",2018,Government & Law
COORDINATION-FOCUSED PATENT POLICY,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; INDEPENDENT INVENTION; RIGHTS; ECONOMICS; SYSTEM; SETTLEMENTS; RETHINKING; ANTITRUST; DEFENSE; LEVERS,"This Article explores the practical consequences of an important shift that has recently taken place in patent theory. Although it was long agreed that the purpose of granting patents is to reward invention, today many scholars instead attempt to justify, the patent system based on its role in facilitating information exchange and enabling technical coordination among firms. This change in justification is controversial, and its viability remains a fiercely contested question. But despite intense attention at the level of theory, little has been said about the consequences of this debate for patent policy itself This Article addresses that void, developing a set of mid-level principles from coordination theory and showing how these principles affect a wide range of policy questions. This analysis has a number of implications. For example, it has long been thought that the coordination function requires granting broader patent rights and doing so at an earlier point in time than the traditional rewards function. Based on this assumption, many scholars have concluded that a coordination focused system would inevitably be more expensive than a rewards-focused one. But upon closer examination, the coordination function could potentially flourish with just the opposite policies-narrower patents granted later in time-and so might actually be cheaper to implement. This illustrates the importance of bringing coordination theory down to details. In many ways, current patent law reflects the long-assumed constraints of rewards theory; a move towards coordination goals opens a number of degrees of policymaking freedom that have not been previously recognized. Moreover, coordination theory can sometimes inform patent policymaking in cases where the conventional rewards theory proves ambiguous, and so merits further exploration regardless of whether coordination is ultimately accepted as a principal justification for the patent system.",2016,Government & Law
ANTICOMPETITIVE USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRIALS IN BARGAINING OVER PATENT RIGHTS,; INFORMATION,"In response to widespread concerns about the extent to which trolls distort the patent process and other deficiencies in the patent system, Congress created two new administrative trial processes by which a third party may challenge the validity of a patent in a more streamlined and less costly way than through a civil trial. Unfortunately, the very features that made these administrative quasi-judicial proceedings efficient also make them ripe for anticompetitive abuse. This behavior is especially problematic when it comes to bargaining over licenses for patents recognized as a standard or deemed to be essential to a particular industry. In this context, instituting administrative trials to determine patent validity may actually create an inequality in bargaining strength that allows the potential licensee to extract rents from the patent holder-especially if that licensee possesses market power. This Note explores the source and nature of these anticompetitive harms and recognizes that, as currently applied by the courts, antitrust law cannot be used to reach these abuses. Noerr-Pennington immunity shields firms from exposure to antitrust liability with respect to most government interactions, with only narrow exceptions for sham petitioning and litigating activity. In the patent context, these exceptions are far too narrow and make antitrust liability functionally unobtainable. In particular, this Note argues that the sham litigation exception to Noerr-Pennington should be expanded to encompass a wider range of litigation tactics-including instituting an administrative proceeding-to deter anticompetitive behavior that distorts both bargaining over patent licenses and the market more broadly.",2016,Government & Law

By convention and by rule, these drawings contain figures and parts that are annotated with numbered labels but not with text. As a result, readers must scan the document to find the description of a given part label. To make progress toward automatic creation of 'tool-tips' and hyperlinks from part labels to their associated descriptions, the USPTO hosted a monthlong online competition in which participants developed algorithms to detect figures and diagram part labels. The challenge drew 232 teams of two, of which 70 teams (30 %) submitted solutions. An unusual feature was that each patent was represented by a 300-dpi page scan along with an HTML file containing patent text, allowing integration of text processing and graphics recognition in participant algorithms. The design and performance of the top-5 systems are presented along with a system developed after the competition, illustrating that the winning teams produced near state-of-the-art results under strict time and computation constraints. The first place system used the provided HTML text, obtaining a harmonic mean of recall and precision (F-measure) of 88.57 % for figure region detection, 78.81 % for figure regions with correctly recognized figure titles, and 70.98 % for part label detection and recognition.

"Innovation, Patents and Biologics: The Road to Biosimilar Competition: Factors Influencing Investment, Business Decisions and Marketing of Biosimilars",Barriers to entry; Biologics; Biosimilars; Competition; Exclusivity; Innovation; Patents; Research and development; HURDLES,"This chapter provides an overview of the biosimilar market in the U.S. Biosimilars are defined as highly similar to the originator biologic. Biologics are some of the highest priced drugs that treat some of the most serious diseases. The R&D for biologics can be in the billions of dollars. Recently, patents on various biologics have expired, opening up the market to competition from biosimilars. An abbreviated pathway for biosimilars was created through the 2009 Biologic Price Competition and Innovation Act. Seven biosimilars have been approved with only 3 on the market. Exclusivity and patents and the various legal issues that biosimilars face are examined. We examine the potential gains from biosimilars and the future market structure of the biosimilar market. This analysis will help potential biosimilars producers take a holistic view towards the challenges and prepare for the upcoming competition in making biosimilars a reality.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
OPENING THE PATENT SYSTEM: DIFFUSIONARY LEVERS IN PATENT LAW,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ACADEMIC RESEARCH; DISCLOSURE; INNOVATION; MARKET; TECHNOLOGY; INCENTIVES; RULES,"The patent system uses exclusion to stimulate innovation. But a mounting body of evidence calls into question the assumption that innovation based on excluding others is the only, or even primary, way that the patent system supports innovation today. Nearly 50 percent of manufacturers got the idea for their most important new product from an outside source that shared it with them, 45-59 percent of patentees acquire patents in order to access the technology of others, and over 2,100 companies, including five of the top ten holders of patents, have committed to sharing their patents with others.' But because the essence of a patent is the right to exclude, policymakers have paid relatively less attention to ways in which patents can be used to include and to diffuse technology. This paper focuses on the ways that innovators are modifying the patent system's exclusionary defaults, employing open source approaches, licenses, pledges, contracts, defensive publication and patenting, and related mechanisms to share innovation-including with their rivals. This Article advocates supporting and encouraging, rather than just tolerating these uses of the patent system, for several reasons. First, as innovation takes place in open and closed modes, the patent system can increase its relevance to all types of innovation. Second, weaknesses in voluntary diffusionary arrangements-for example, the lack of enforceability of patent pledges or open source commitments, the use of patents subject to licensing commitments to seek injunctions, and the use of once-defensive patents for patent -assertion suggest that the policy environment for innovation could be improved. Finally, providing ways for patent holders to take voluntary steps to curtail or limit their rights can offer a more flexible and predictable framework for rebalancing the patent system than measures like imposing limits on patentable subject matter or compulsory licensing. This Article recommends reorienting the patent system to better support open innovation models. Making it easier to waive and rely on waivers of patent rights, for example in support of open source strategies, by making it easier to record pledges, creating an open or defensive-only patent option that allows patentees to pay discounted maintenance fees in exchange for giving up offensive rights, or allowing patentees to give up certain rights while retaining others, akin to license of right schemes in the United Kingdom and Germany, could improve sharing and the freedom to operate. Making it easier to place inventions in the public domain through effective defensive publication and a change in the default regarding patent publication would encourage earlier dissemination of information. So would setting defaults so that provisional applications are open rather than closed to the public and utility applications publish upon filing rather than after an eighteen-month delay. Improving reporting and discovery of patent information, including ownership, availability for licensing, patent licenses, and standards commitments, could boost markets for technology transfers.",2016,Government & Law

"Examining inventions, shaping property: The savants and the French patent system",Examination of inventions; France; intellectual property; patents; science and industry; specifications; ,"In 1791, the Loi relative aux decouvertes utiles instituted a new patent system in France. Because patents were seen as the expression of the natural right of inventors, prior examination was abolished. However, only a few years after the law was passed, an unofficial examination was reinstated, and it was entrusted to the Comite Consultatif des Arts et Manufactures - a consultative body composed of prominent scientists. I analyze the political significance of the involvement of the savants in the patent system, and based on the archives of the Comite, I study the scope and practicalities of the examination process, paying close attention to the ways through which the savants of the Comite directly intervened in the writing and drawing of specifications. I show how a distinct regime of intellectual property emerged in France and how it was constructed by the interests and norms of scientists, eager as they were to distinguish 'science' from 'industry' and establish the superiority of the former over the latter.",2019,History & Philosophy of Science
Utility model patent regime strength and technological development: Experiences of China and other East Asian latecomers,Utility model patents; Utility model patent regime strength; Utility model patent regime strictness and appropriability-strength; China; East Asian latecomers; Catch-up strategy; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; IMPACTS; INDEX,"This paper analyzes how strategic calibration of utility model patent regimes - which provide a type of patent right that is distinct from invention patents and is far less studied in the literature - over time is intended to facilitate technological development. To do this, the paper develops what appear to be the first indexes of utility model patent regime strength (divided into strictness and appropriability indexes), which it tabulates for mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan per every year from the time of inception of their laws governing utility models (the first of which was in 1905) till 2016. It then analyzes these indexes via fixed effects regressions and case studies. The results show that East Asian latecomers instituted utility model patent regimes that were less strict and offered less appropriability during earlier stages of economic catch-up, likely in order to facilitate technological learning. Subsequently, the strictness of the regimes was increased as knowledge accumulation and, to some extent, technological capabilities increased and, in mainland China's case especially, as patent quality problems were experienced. It is also found that increasing the strictness of utility model patent regimes may reduce patenting in the short-term, but not the long-term. Six propositions are formulated, including the overall conclusion that successful latecomers seem to have pursued a dynamic catch-up strategy of transitioning from imitative to more sophisticated technological development by increasing both the strictness and appropriability-strength of their utility model patent regimes in conjunction with increasing knowledge accumulation and, to some extent, technological capabilities. It is suggested that mainland China might benefit from further increasing the strictness of its utility model patent regime in the future. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Person Skilled in the Art in Synthetic Biology from Iraqi and Malaysian Perspectives,Patent; Synthetic biology; Iraqi law; Malaysian law; ,"This article presents the problem of a person skilled in the field of synthetic biology. The person skilled in the art is one of the notions which have to be revisited due to the multidisciplinary nature of synthetic biology which involves numerous fields. The article studies this problem from the perspectives of Iraqi and Malaysian patent laws. First, it conceptualizes synthetic biology and person skilled in the art. The Iraqi and Malaysian attitudes regarding person skilled in the art are then addressed. Afterwards, the paper points out the multidisciplinary nature of synthetic biology. In its last part, it discusses the person skilled in synthetic biology and how patent offices and courts deal with this point. Finally, the authors submit that the use of a team of skilled persons to substitute for a single technician would render the obviousness test a subjective assessment dependent on the inventor. The level of non-obviousness would differ in similar cases simply because of the number of inventors. Consequently, the suggestion of having a hypothetical team instead of one person is irrelevant because skills that are attributed to the skilled notional person are not real skills. Thus, replacing him is easy, but the replacement would be fruitless because the skills attributed to a person or a team will be similar.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; History & Philosophy of Science

It firstly seeks to define the boundaries of oceans and human health research. We use three case studies as examples: biomedical research, marine litter and human well-being. Biomedical research raises complex issues relating to coastal states' sovereign rights to exploit their marine resources and the patenting processes. Coastal states have differing degrees of control over research at sea. There are differences in EU and US law over the status of genetic discoveries, with the US having stricter criteria to qualify for patent protection. International law sets the standard for bioprospecting in developing countries under the Nagoya Protocol. The cost and complexity of marine biomedical research mean that it cannot be left to commercial exploration and needs some public funding. The second case study highlights the rise in marine plastics pollution using Marine Conservation Society beachwatch data. It details the need to alter product design to avoid marine pollution and records an unsuccessful attempt by academics and an NGO to make contact with the manufacturers of one polluting product. It also introduces the concept that faulty design could amount to a public nuisance. The third case study highlights the potential health benefits from access to the coast and the statutory responsibility which sits with the US and UK authorities in the provision of well-being. It posits that there needs to be greater inter-agency coordination to promote access to the coast for human well-being.",2016,Marine & Freshwater Biology

These linkages range from formal agreements, such as patent licenses and research alliances, to informal collaborations, such as joint research, copublication, and consulting. Because biotechnology involves a new research method, the tacit knowledge embedded in it became critical to its commercialization. Specifically, it requires the direct involvement of star scientists who have this tacit knowledge and are well remunerated for it. This process is facilitated by the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, which allows universities to retain ownership of crucial patents and provides incentives to the star scientists to cooperate in development and commercialization. Over time, a complex web of collaborations and alliances has evolved in therapeutic, diagnostic, and pharmaceutical biotechnology, whereas extensive consolidation has occurred in agricultural biotechnology.",2016,Agriculture; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
Patents as a Spur to Subsequent Innovation? Evidence from Pharmaceuticals,; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; LIFE; COMPETITION; HEALTH,"This paper examines how an incumbent's patent protection acts as an implicit subsidy toward non-infringing substitutes. I analyze whether classes of pharmaceuticals whose first entrant has a longer period of market exclusivity (time between approval and generic entry) see more subsequent entry. Instrumenting for exclusivity using plausibly exogenous delays in the development process, I find that a one-year increase in the first entrant's market exclusivity increases subsequent entry by 0.2 drugs. The effect is stronger for subsequent entrants that are lesser clinical advances, suggesting it is driven primarily by imitation.",2016,Business & Economics
"A TALE OF TWO LAYERS: PATENTS, STANDARDIZATION, AND THE INTERNET",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; FRAND,"In recent years, high-profile lawsuits involving standards-essential patents (SEPs) have made headlines in the United States, Europe, and Asia, leading to a heated public debate regarding the role and impact of patents covering key interoperability standards. Enforcement agencies around the world have investigated and prosecuted alleged violations of competition law and private licensing commitments in connection with SEPs. Yet, while the debate has focused broadly on standardization and patents in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, commentators have paid little attention to differences among technology layers within ICT. This Article uses both existing and new empirical data to show that patent filing and assertion activity is substantially lower for Internet-related standards than for standards relating to telecommunications and other computing technologies. It analyzes historical and social factors that may have contributed to this divergence focusing on the two principal Internet standards bodies: the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It counters the dominant narrative that standards and SEPs are necessarily fraught with litigation and thereby necessitate radical systemic change. Instead, it shows that standards policies that de-emphasize patent monetization have led to lower levels of disputes and litigation. It concludes by placing recent discussions of patenting and standards within the broader context of openness in network technologies and urges both industry participants and policy makers to look to the success of Internet standardization in a patent-light environment when considering the adoption of new rules and policies.",2016,Government & Law
EXPANDING THE PATENT OFFICE'S REGULATORY FOOTPRINT: A PROPOSAL FOR REIMBURSING INVALIDITY CHALLENGES,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; TROLLS; INSURANCE; MARKET; SYSTEM; PTO,"The patent system's apparent resilience to changes in the law, and the persistent complaints about abusive patent assertions, might reflect the futility of patent reform efforts over the past several decades. But there may be another factor contributing to the patent system's resistance to change: The regulatory coverage provided by the two primary regulatory entities in the patent system-the federal courts and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO)-may be inadequate. Because the regulatory footprint of the federal courts is limited by Article III considerations, the possibilities for expanding the PTO's regulatory footprint warrant greater attention. Given its limited mandate of examining applications and granting patents, the PTO has taken a hands-off approach to patents once they are issued. The PTO's post-issuance passivity has left the job of policing abusive assertions-and by extension, patent quality-predominantly to accused infringers, for whom the high cost of validity challenges often encourages the payment of nuisance fees, which makes abusive assertions profitable and promotes the further procurement and assertion of patents in problematic ways. To enable and induce the PTO to take a more active role in policing abusive assertions, this Article draws from the lessons of the auto insurance industry to propose that Congress should require the PTO to collect an annual, individualized fee on each patent-in-force-which would be set according to the risk of invalidation of that patent-to fund a program to reimburse the expenses incurred by accused infringers who prevail in challenging a patent at the PTO's administrative tribunal, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. This arrangement would help create a regulatory feedback loop that could expand the PTO's regulatory footprint in the patent system, with several potential benefits: (1) it may further encourage challenges to weak patents as an alternative to paying nuisance fees to avoid or settle litigation; (2) it may allow the PTO to indirectly regulate or influence the behavior of patentees with respect to post-issuance activities such as assertion; (3) it may provide a mechanism for the PTO to incentivize patentees to adopt quality-enhancing prosecution habits; and (4) it may create a source of fiscal pressure for the PTO that may prompt it to make operational changes to improve patent quality in the face of possible opposition from its patentee customers.",2019,Government & Law
University patenting and technology commercialization - legal frameworks and the importance of local practice,; BAYH-DOLE ACT; ACADEMIC RESEARCH; TRANSFER OFFICES; IVORY TOWER; INDUSTRY; IMPACT; ENTREPRENEURIAL; PERFORMANCE; CREATION; EUROPE,"The impact of national legislative frameworks on the higher education sector's contribution to technological innovation is heavily disputed. This paper argues that legislative frameworks may stimulate the development of local practices for the management and exploitation of intellectual property (IP), which in turn determine the level of academic patenting. We present case studies of two comparable universities in each of four selected European countries with different histories of national IP legislation. A within-country analysis shows that a wider range and earlier development of local IP management and exploitation practices are accompanied by higher levels of academic patenting, and that increasing similarity of IP practices is associated with decreasing differences in patenting outputs. A preliminary cross-country analysis reveals an expansion in and increasing similarity of practices for IP management and exploitation in countries with different national IP framework histories. We conclude that adopting Bayh-Dole-like legislation may trigger the development of local IP practices, which stimulate patenting. However, it is not always sufficient and definitely not always necessary. The study concludes with some policy recommendations.",2018,Business & Economics

(IN)VALID PATENTS,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; RETHINKING; COURT; SITUATION; SYSTEM; POLICY; FACTS; LAW,"Increasingly, accused infringers challenge a patent's validity in two different forums: in litigation in federal court and in post-issuance review at the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). These parallel proceedings have produced conflicting and controversial results. For example, in one recent case, a district court rejected a challenge to a patent's validity and awarded millions of dollars in damages for infringement. The Federal Circuit initially affirmed those rulings, ending the litigation over the patent's validity. In a subsequent appeal about royalties owed by the infringer, however, the Federal Circuit vacated the entire judgment-including the validity ruling and damages award it had previously affirmed-because the PTO had since decided that the patent was invalid. The Federal Circuit reasoned that only final court judgments are immune from the effects of PTO review and, because of the open issue about royalties, no final judgment existed when the PTO rendered its conflicting decision on patent validity. The Federal Circuit's stringent conception of finality, which this Article terms the absolute finality rule, raises serious questions of judicial economy, fairness, and separation of powers. Among other things, it allows accused infringers multiple opportunities to defeat liability, permits an administrative agency to effectively nullify decisions of Article III courts, and incentivizes courts to abstain from hearing patent cases altogether, at least until the PTO reconsiders the patent's validity. That said, some inefficiency or unfairness is inevitable when two different government bodies can evaluate the validity of the same patent, and the absolute finality rule, if nothing else, provides a relatively bright-line test. But it is not the only way to mediate disagreements between the courts and the PTO. This Article, in addition to identifying, describing, and critiquing the absolute finality rule, explores several other options for providing greater certainty about patent validity.",2016,Government & Law
Is There a Moore's Law for 3D Printing?,3D printing; 3D printers; additive manufacturing; additive manufacturing processes; STUDYING TECHNOLOGICAL-PROGRESS; FUNCTIONAL-APPROACH; ENERGY TECHNOLOGY; PATENT CITATIONS; EXTENSION,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing (3DP) has received significant attention for its promise of reinventing the way products are manufactured. At times, there have been differences in the expectations of the public of what the technology would be able to do as compared with what the technology was capable of at a certain point in time. Although experts often feel that future improvements will overcome this, there is usually not a sense of how rapidly these future improvements will occur. The semiconductor industry and others have effectively addressed this problem by tracking how quickly the technology improves over time (i.e., Moore's law). This article looks at industrial stereolithography (SLA) 3DP and measures the technological improvement rate empirically at 37.6% per year and compares it with an estimate based on analysis of the patents that have been issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in SLA 3DP. This approach has been shown to give reliable estimates and in this SLA 3D case gives a very close estimate of 46.8% per year. We then find representative sets of patents and use the estimating technique to calculate the expected technological improvement rate for four other main types of 3DP: inkjet-powder-based 3DP (35.0%), metal selective laser sintering (SLS) (33.3%), fused filament fabrication (FFF) (16.7%), nonmetal SLS (21.1%), and for the 3DP domain as a whole (29.4%). Further analysis on the patent sets provides top assignees and the most central patents for each of the 3DP domains. Overall, the improvement rates found support the idea that 3DP is rapidly improving and, therefore, potentially capable of fulfilling its promise but also that some 3DP approaches (particularly FFF and nonmetal SLS) are likely improving at a lower rate.",2018,Engineering; Materials Science
Affordability versus innovation: Is compulsory licensing the solution?,Compulsory license; intellectual property rights; TRIPS agreement; DOHA declaration; TRIPS flexibility; MEDICINES; ACCESS; BRAZIL; DRUGS,"In an era which marks an exceptional phase of growth in science and technology, the acute disparities in access to healthcare still persist. So where on one hand scientific advancement in medicine aims at increasing life expectancy, on the other hand there are millions who are denied access to existing medicines. Patents on medicines also pose a significant barrier to access new drugs, especially in low and middle income countries which already suffer from poor health financing mechanisms. The patent laws were built on the assumption of incentivizing the innovators by rewarding them with the exclusive right to produce, sell or market the innovation. The basic premise for granting patents was based on the thought that it would increase investment in research and development promoting dynamic gains through newer innovations. However, evidence found to support this justification is meager. So in a situation where the drug gap still persists and we aim to achieve sustainable development goals by 2030, this paper attempts to focus on understanding how compulsory licensing has been used in selected cases to alleviate the major legal and political barriers to access medicines. The methodology comprises of cross-country comparison of patent framework and compulsory licensing cases. The sample selected for study includes both developed as well as developing countries. The aim is to evaluate the policy approaches used by selected countries to grant compulsory licenses and to identify the best practices for evidence-based policy making on international issues related to pharmaceutical patents. In each case, a driving factor has been the international extension of patent laws through trade agreements; first bilaterally (US-Canada) and subsequently internationally (1995 Uruguay round, under which low- and middle-income countries were granted a grace period until 2005 to comply).",2019,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; General & Internal Medicine"

FORESIGHT BIAS IN PATENT LAW,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; RIGHTS; RETHINKING; ECONOMICS; HINDSIGHT; SCIENCE; INNOVATION; NORMS,"Much of patent reform has focused on efforts to make it harder to obtain and enforce low-quality patents. The most straightforward way to achieve this goal is to raise the substantive standards of patentability. What is often ignored in discussions about raising patentability standards is that high-quality inventions can slip through the cracks. What is more troubling is that sometimes this happens because of bias. This Article draws attention to foresight bias, which occurs when a decision-maker lets over-pessimism and an oversimplified view of the future influence the patentability determination. Foresight bias leads to a patent denial regardless of the invention's technical merit. Particularly susceptible are inventions emerging from unpredictable fields like chemistry and biotechnology things like chemical compounds and DNA fragments. If the invention's principal purpose is to serve as a building block for something else, it is unpatentable. The fear is that a patent could create a monopoly of knowledge and impede future research. Empirical studies, however, suggest that these fears have largely not materialized. More importantly, the patent denial costs the inventor, society, and the patent system. This Article offers a solution to this problem. It proposes a new paradigm that gauges the patentability of building block inventions in unpredictable fields objectively without reliance on the utility requirement the principal conduit for foresight bias. Its implementation will promote disclosure, foster more creative activity, reduce wasteful duplicative research efforts, and promote technological progress all important objectives of the patent system. Eliminating the bias will also reconnect the patent system to many of the technical communities that it serves.",2015,Government & Law
In which developing countries are patents on essential medicines being filed?,Pharmaceutical policy; Intellectual property; Access to medicines; Essential medicines; Global governance; International trade; AIDS TREATMENT; ACCESS,"Background: This article is based upon data gathered during a study conducted in partnership with the World Intellectual Property Organization on the patent status of products appearing on the World Health Organization's 2013 Model List of Essential Medicines (MLEM). It is a statistical analysis aimed at answering: in which developing countries are patents on essential medicines being filed? Methods: Patent data were collected by linking those listed in the United States and Canada's medicine patent registers to corresponding patents in developing countries using two international patent databases (INPADOC and Derwent) via a commerical-grade patent search platform (Thomson Innovation). The respective supplier companies were then contacted to correct and verify our data. We next tallied the number of MLEM patents per developing country. Spearman correlations were done to assess bivariate relationships between variables, and a multivariate regression model was developed to explain the number of MLEM patents in each country using SPSS 23.0. Results: A subset of 20 of the 375 (5%) products on the 2013 MLEM fit our inclusion criteria. The patent estate reports (i.e., the global list of patents for a given drug) varied greatly in their number with a median of 48 patents (interquartile range [IQR]: 26-76). Their geographic reach had a median of 15% of the developing countries sampled (IQR: 8-28%). The number of developing countries covered appeared to increase with the age of the patent estate (r =.433, p = 0.028). The number of MLEM patents per country was significantly positively associated with human development index (HDI), gross domestic income (GDI) per capita, total healthcare expenditure per capita, population size, the Rule of Law Index, and average education level. Population size, GDI per capita, and healthcare expenditure (in % of national expenditure) were predictors of the number of MLEM patents in countries (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.009, respectively). Population size was the most important predictor (beta = 0.59), followed by income (GDI per capita) (beta = 0.32), and healthcare expenditure (beta = 0.15). Holding the other factors constant, (i) 14.3 million more people, (ii) $833.33 more per capita (GDI), or (iii) 0.88% more of national spending on healthcare resulted in 1 additional essential medicine patent. Conclusion: Population was a powerful predictor of the number of patent filings in developing countries along with GDI and healthcare expenditure. The age and historical context of the patent estate may make a difference in the number of patents and countries covered. Broad surveillance and benchmarking of the global medicine patent landscape is valuable for detecting significant shifts that may occur over time. With improved international medicine patent transparency by companies and data available through third parties, such studies will be increasingly feasible.",2017,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Eurasian patent No. EA 001809 includes substitution of the correct chemical name of the patented substances with an erroneous synonym, and the statement of claim, along with lack of novelty of the data on the properties of the patented substances, includes contradictory and unreliable information irrelevant to the item subject to the patent. This approach to prolonging the period of legal protection of a substance used as an APS is not acceptable either from the scientific or from the ethical points of view. Our x-ray diffraction study of abacavir sulfate (USP RS) showed that this substance and abacavir hemisulfate are identical, on the basis of published data on the structure of abacavir hemisulfate crystals. Each of these substances is a neutral salt and each has the atomic formula (C14H19N6O)(2)SO4 and a molecular weight of 670.76. Thus, repatenting a known APS (i.e., abacavir sulfate) as a new substance under a name incorrect for a neutral salt, i.e., (1S,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]cyclopent-2-en-1-methanol hemisulfate, is unjustified.",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
"If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em? How Sitting by Designation Affects Judicial Behavior",; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; PATENT,"Judges, lawyers, and scholars have long decried the high reversal rate district courts face in patent cases. Many have suggested greater district court specialization as a solution, and Congress in 2011 enacted legislation to promote such specialization. In this Article, we investigate the impact of a novel measure of a judge's experience with patent cases whether a district court judge has sat by designation on a Federal Circuit panel in a patent claim construction appeal on the likelihood a district judge's subsequent claim constructions are reversed. Before sitting by designation, judges who later do so actually have a slightly higher claim construction reversal rate than judges who never do so. After sitting by designation, the reversal rate of district court judges on subsequent claim construction appeals decreases by over 50%. This decrease is not explained by other measures of experience, including the number of prior patent cases or years on the bench. Nor is it fully explained by the timing of the appeal, the particular district court judge, or various other characteristics of the patents, the parties, and the litigation. Our results might be thought to suggest a simple way to reduce the reversal rate in patent and perhaps other sorts of cases. But there is a catch: our evidence suggests this increased agreement is due to increased Federal Circuit trust in the decisions of individual judges who have sat by designation and not increased district judge understanding of claim construction. Personal relationships, not learning patent law, seem to explain why the reversal rate drops.",2016,Government & Law

This paper uses publications data and US patent data to examine the role played by leading research-intensive universities in the national innovation systems of the emerging economy of China and the newly industrialised economies (NIE) of Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan. Our analysis highlights significant differences amongst these five East Asian economies, and also reveals contrasts to observed patterns in the USA and Europe. Our findings confirm that universities in the five economies have increased their contribution to their respective national innovation systems in terms of research output and R&D collaboration. The NIE universities experienced rapid patent growth rates over 1995-2005, followed by Chinese universities in the subsequent period of 2006-2010. However, the contribution of universities in all five East Asian economies to the total volume of IP creation in their economies generally remains low. Moreover, patent quality is low compared to patents from non-university sectors, suggesting weak technology commercialisation impacts.",2015,Business & Economics
Does stronger patent protection increase export variety? Evidence from US product-level data,intellectual property; international property law; international regulations; trade flows; multiple regression analysis; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION,"Proponents of global intellectual property rights (IPRs) reforms have argued that developing countries' weak IPRs limit their access to foreign innovative products and technologies. Central to our understanding of the effects of IPRs on product access is the influence of national differences in patent protection on corporate behavior and business strategy of multinational firms. Using detailed product data on US exports from 1990 to 2000, this research note assesses the impact of strengthening IPRs in developing countries on product variety of US exports. Colonial origin and cross-industry variation in patent effectiveness serve to identify the impact. The results show that the strengthening of IPRs increased exports of new products in patent-sensitive industries. The expansion in product variety accounted for the entire increase in US exports. The findings substantiate claims that ratification of TRIPS by developing countries promotes access to new foreign products and technologies. Additionally, the results demonstrate that patent protection is a significant institutional factor in US firms' business decisions over the introduction of new products and processes into a developing country marketplace.",2015,Business & Economics
"Grantbacks, territorial restraints, and innovation",Licensing; Innovation; Grantback; Patent; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; PATENT; MARKET; CLAUSES,"We analyse the effect of grantback clauses in licensing contracts. While competition authorities fear that grantback clauses might decrease the licensee's ex post incentives to innovate, a standard defence is that grantback clauses are required for the patent-owner to agree to license its technology in the first place. We examine the validity of this but for defence and the equilibrium effect of grantback clauses on the innovation incentives of the licensee for both non-severable and severable innovations, which roughly correspond to infringing and non-infringing innovations. We show that grantback clauses do not increase the patent-holder's incentives to license when non-severable innovations are at stake but they do when severable innovations are concerned - suggesting that the but for defence might be valid for severable innovations but not for non-severable ones, in direct contradiction to regulation in some jurisdictions. Moreover we show that, for severable innovations, grantback clauses can increase the range of parameters for which follow-on innovation by the licensee occurs. Our work extends the large literature on sequential innovation to an environment where information diffuses through licensing rather than through the mere act of patenting. In this different informational set up we show that Green and Scotchmer (1995)'s conclusion that the initial innovator should have a patent of infinite breadth no longer holds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the provisions establishing patent linkage mechanisms in several agreements appear to reflect a degree of ambiguity, potentially enabling some flexibility in their implementation. In this study, we reviewed the features of the prototypic patent linkage mechanism established by the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States, and compared these with the implementation of systems in three countries whose agreements with the US include patent linkage obligations. From these analyses, we draw lessons for moderating the impact of these mechanisms on access to generic medicines.MethodsWe reviewed the features of the patent linkage mechanism in the US, and undertook a detailed analysis of relevant treaty provisions and the manner of implementation in Canada, Australia, and South Korea.ResultsA key difference between the US implementation of patent linkage and that of its trading partners is the disparate treatment afforded to biologics. Because of the significant differences in the regulatory frameworks applying to small molecule and biologic medicines in the US, the Hatch- Waxman provisions do not apply to biologics and they are not subject to patent linkage. By contrast, the regulatory frameworks in Canada, Australia and South Korea do not reflect similar distinctions and thus patent linkage mechanisms also capture biologics. Additional variations in implementation, mainly the result of constructive ambiguities in the respective treaty texts, offer potential opportunity for mitigating the adverse impact of patent linkage provisions on market entry of generic medicines. Practical measures include ensuring the availability of an accessible, transparent and easily searchable database of patent information; avoiding automatic stays of generic marketing approval where possible; and requiring certification by rights holders to prevent abuse of the system.ConclusionsWhere countries accept treaty obligations to establish patent linkage mechanisms, the impact on access to generic medicines may be moderated to a degree by retaining and exploiting constructive ambiguities in the treaty text and addressing practical aspects of implementation.",2018,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
Gene Patents in Canada: Is There a New Legal Landscape?,; LONG-QT SYNDROME; SETTLEMENT; IMPACT,"In 2016, the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) announced the settlement of its patent lawsuit against US-based Transgenomic, Inc. At issue in the case was CHEO's ability to test for gene mutations associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS) that are described in Transgenomic's patents. CHEO challenged the patents as invalid, and Transgenomic ultimately agreed to license them on a royalty-free basis to CHEO and other healthcare institutions for LQTS testing and research. While widely celebrated in the media, the ethical rhetoric surrounding the settlement has at times obscured the practical and legal context in which it was made and will operate. Here, we provide a nuanced account of the events surrounding the settlement and its implications for research and clinical care. Although the settlement is remarkable for the transparency of its terms and its inclusion of a license intended to benefit unaffiliated test providers, we conclude that another significant implication of the settlement may be its elimination of the opportunity to clarify an increasingly confused area of Canadian law against a backdrop of continued international controversy surrounding the patenting of genes and gene-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods.",2018,Genetics & Heredity; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

The need for consistent public policy and robust frameworks for regulatory control poses significant challenges for the introduction of genetically engineered/modified crop plants in India. This is especially vital considering India's desire to foster an innovation-based economy. The research questions of this chapter include the following: How is the insertion of different traits, such as insect resistance in plants by methods such as transformation different from introgression/hybridization? Can genetic modification of plants by methods such as transformation be termed as an essentially biological process? If not, how can the said process be classified for the purpose of Section 3(j) of the Indian Patents Act, 1970?",2019,Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law

Deference Mistakes,; CONSTITUTIONAL CRIMINAL-PROCEDURE; STATES SUPREME-COURT; QUALIFIED IMMUNITY; JUDICIAL DEFERENCE; RETHINKING; APPEALS; MYTH; PEARSON; WARREN; STANDARDS,"This Article begins with what should seem a relatively straightforward proposition: it is impossible to fully understand a case's holding without understanding its deference regime-the standard of review or burden of proof that governs the case. If a court holds in the context of a habeas petition that a constitutional right was not clearly established, that does not necessarily mean that the court would hold that the right does not exist were it writing on a blank slate. If a court refuses to invalidate a granted patent, which is presumed valid and can be held invalid only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence, that does not mean that the court believes the patent should have been granted in the first place. And if an appellate court holds that a trial court's ruling was not plain error, that does not necessarily mean that the appellate court believes the trial court reached the correct result or would have affirmed the ruling if the review were more searching. Yet in case after case, we find that judges (and their clerks) confuse one deference regime for another or ignore deference entirely. In so doing, they make what we term deference mistakes. Courts in standard criminal cases regularly rely on habeas precedents holding that a federal right was not clearly established to conclude that the right does not exist. The Federal Circuit and the Patent and Trademark Office regularly rely on precedents involving granted patents (which are presumed valid) to justify granting new patents (which are not entitled to that presumption). And courts of appeals regularly rely on plain error precedents to justify holdings in cases in which the standard of review is less deferential. Although the problem of deference mistakes cuts across legal doctrines, it has been neither identified nor described in prior scholarship. Our Article presents a multitude of examples of deference mistakes in practice and explains why they are likely to occur. Deference mistakes may seem relatively innocuous, particularly if they are confined to individual cases. But that appearance is misleading. We develop a theoretical model of how deference mistakes, coupled with particular asymmetries in adjudication, can generate systematic shifts in legal doctrine. Deference mistakes may have contributed to the current patent crisis by adding to the proliferation of bad patents. They may also be partly responsible for retrenchment in the law of constitutional criminal procedure rights or the pro-employer shift in employment discrimination law. After analyzing deference mistakes' potential to affect the long-term evolution of the law, we discuss possible solutions.",2015,Government & Law

Trends in Medicaid Reimbursements for Insulin From 1991 Through 2014,; HUMAN NPH INSULIN; DIABETES-MELLITUS; COSTS; GLARGINE; THERAPY; ADHERENCE; ACCESS,"IMPORTANCE Insulin is a vital medicine for patients with diabetes mellitus. Newer, more expensive insulin products and the lack of generic insulins in the United States have increased costs for patients and insurers. OBJECTIVE To examine Medicaid payment trends for insulin products. Cost information is available for all 50 states and has been recorded since the 1990s. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A time-series analysis comparing reimbursements and prices. Using state-and national-level Medicaid data from 1991 to 2014, we identified all patients who used 1 or more of the 16 insulin products that were continuously available in the United States between 2006 and 2014. Insulin products were classified into rapid-acting and long-acting analogs, short-acting, intermediate, and premixed insulins based on American Diabetes Association Guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Inflation-adjusted payments made to pharmacies by Medicaid per 1mL (100 IU) of insulin in 2014 US dollars. RESULTS Since 1991, Medicaid reimbursement per unit (1 mL) of insulin dispensed has risen steadily. In the 1990s, Medicaid reimbursed pharmacies between $2.36 and $4.43 per unit. By 2014, reimbursement for short-acting insulins increased to $9.64 per unit; intermediate, $9.22; premixed, $14.79; and long-acting, $19.78. Medicaid reimbursement for rapid-acting insulin analogs rose to $19.81 per unit. The rate of increase in reimbursement was higher for insulins with patent protection ($0.20 per quarter) than without ($0.05 per quarter) (P < .001). Total Medicaid reimbursements peaked at $407.4 million dollars in quarter 2 of 2014. Total volume peaked at 29.9 million units in quarter 4 of 2005 and was 21.2 million units in quarter 2 of 2014. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Between 1991 and 2014, there was a near-exponential upward trend in Medicaid payments on a per-unit basis for a wide variety of insulin products regardless of formulation, duration of action, and whether the product was patented. Although reimbursements for newer, patent-protected insulin analogs increased at a faster rate than reimbursements for older insulins, payments increased for all products we examined. Our findings suggest a lack of price competition in the United States for this class of medications.",2015,General & Internal Medicine

Based on what was developed by Marlene Wayar, as an example of sudaca criticism and internal blasphemy, the travesti critique points out that the law does not recognize the specificity of the transvestite identity or its patent inequality, and it reintroduces the binary man/woman categories because it is capable of sanctioning only on the basis of a general population and within a liberal framework of state recognition. In this article the travesti critique of the Gender Identity Law is taken up to indicate a terrain of interrogations and challenges where the law becomes an instance of politicization, that is, where it becomes a field of strategic action and agency, but also a social tool and an instance of resistance, rejoinder, and reply.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics
Protecting essential information about genetic variants as trade secrets: a problem for public policy?,trade secret; public policy; myriad genetics; march-in rights; genetic test; genetic variant; SEQUENCE VARIANTS; ASSOCIATION; GENOMICS,"In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held that naturally occurring human genes are not patentable subject matter. This decision, invalidating patents held by Myriad Genetics involving genes affecting breast cancer, appeared to further the constitutional policy behind intellectual property protection to promote scientific progress and to make genetic testing more readily available to patients. However, the decision's ironic aftermath is continuing assertion by genetic testing companies of trade secrets protections over information about the significance of genetic variants. This article analyzes possible approaches to the assertion of trade secret protections over information about the significance of genetic variants. Specifically, we consider five approaches: voluntary responses from the scientific community; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or CMS regulation; creation of additional march-in rights as under the Bayh Dole Act; compulsory licensing as under patent law; and creation of a public policy exception to trade secret protection. We explore what each approach would require legally if applied to break trade secret barriers, together with their advantages and disadvantages. While our analysis concerns genetic information, we conclude with some thoughts about its relevance to other types of big data now protected by trade secrets such as information about innovations in quality of care.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine

With respect to three of the patents-in-suit, governed by the pre-America Invents Act (AIA) version of 102, the district court found the claims not invalid based on its conclusion that the invention was not ready for patenting before the critical date. With respect to the fourth patent-in-suit, which is governed by the AIA version of 102, the district court concluded that there was no commercial offer for sale because the AIA changed the relevant standard and that, in any event, the invention was not ready for patenting before the critical date. The Federal Circuit reversed, holding that (1) the AIA did not change the statutory meaning of on sale'' so as to require public disclosure of the details of the invention in the terms of sale, so long as the existence of the sale is public; and (2) the district court clearly erred in applying too demanding a standard for establishing that an invention is ready for patenting'' based on reduction to practice.

The methods claimed in three of the patents only comprised steps of comparing'' MPO levels in a test subject with those of a control subject, or detecting'' MPO activity in a test patient. All of the claims of these three patents were declared patent ineligible under the Alice two-part framework, based on the court's conclusion that the correlation is a law of nature'' and that practice of the claims does not result in an inventive concept that transforms the natural phenomena of MPO being associated with cardiovascular risk into a patentable invention.'' A fourth patent at issue recited an additional step of administering a lipid-lowering drug to a patient found to be at risk of cardiovascular disease. Although these claims were not declared patent ineligible, they were found not to be infringed by a diagnostic testing company that performed the test but did not administer the drug to a patient, instead sending a report to the patient's physician. The court rejected patent owner's allegations of contributory or induced infringement, holding that a party that provides only a service, but no material or apparatus,'' cannot be liable for contributory infringement, and that induced infringement could not be established given that the facts did not suggest any connection between the accused diagnostic company and doctors that may prescribe lipid-lowering drugs.",2017,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology
A SHIFTING LANDSCAPE FOR SHIFTING FEES: ATTORNEY-FEE AWARDS IN PATENT SUITS AFTER OCTANE AND HIGHMARK,; ,"Section 285 of the Patent Act authorizes courts to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in patent litigation in exceptional cases. Until recently, interpretation of 285 had been governed by a highly restrictive formulation set forth by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In April 2014, the United States Supreme Court released a pair of decisions Octane Fitness v. ICON Health & Fitness, and Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System, Inc.-that rejected the Federal Circuit's interpretation of 285 and reinvigorated the potential for fee shifting in patent suits. This Note argues that the Supreme Court's decisions in Octane and Highmark broaden the potential for parties in patent litigation particularly defendants to seek and receive awards of attorney fees. This Note presents a survey and analysis of the district court opinions deciding attorney-fee motions under 285 announced in the eight months following Octane and Highmark. The results of that survey indicate that defendants are now significantly more likely to receive attorney-fee awards than they were previously. This Note ultimately argues that defendants in patent suits should consider these new fee dynamics as a key element of their litigation strategy from the outset of patent defense cases. Doing so may enable them to take advantage of the newly expanded opportunity for fee shifting. To that end, this Note suggests that defendants should actively strive to inform district court judges about their broad authority to award fees. Additionally, this Note recommends that litigants avoid analogizing to prior successful cases when arguing for fees. Instead, this Note proposes that parties should follow the example set by the Supreme Court and focus on the plain meaning of the statute using common sense arguments.",2015,Government & Law
"How patents became documents, or dreaming of technoscientific order, 1895-1937",Classification; Patents; Patent offices; Technoscience; Paul Otlet; SCIENCE,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to show how the documentation movement associated with the utopian thinkers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine relied on patent offices as well as the documents most closely associated with this institutional setting - the patents themselves - as central to the formation of the document category. The main argument is that patents not only were subjected to and helped construct, but also in fact engineered the development of technoscientific order during 1895-1937. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on an interdisciplinary approach to intellectual property, document theory and insights from media archeology. Focused on the historical period 1895-1937, this study allows for an analysis that encapsulates and accounts for change in a number of comparative areas, moving from bibliography to documentation and from scientific to technoscientific order. Primary sources include Paul Otlet's own writings, relevant contemporary sources from the French documentation movement and the Congres Mondial de la documentation universelle in 1937. Findings By understanding patent offices and patents as main drivers behind those processes of sorting and classification that constitute technoscientific order, this explorative paper provides a new analytical framework for the study of intellectual property in relation to the history of information and documentation. It argues that the idea of the document may serve to rethink the role of the patent in technoscience, offering suggestions for new and underexplored venues of research in the nexus of several overlapping research fields, from law to information studies. Originality/value Debates over the legitimacy and rationale of intellectual property have raged for many years without signs of abating. Universities, research centers, policy makers, editors and scholars, research funders, governments, libraries and archives all have things to say on the legitimacy of the patent system, its relation to innovation and the appropriate role of intellectual property in research and science, milieus that are of central importance in the knowledge-based economy. The value of this paper lies in proposing a new way to approach patents that could show a way out of the current analytical gridlock of either/or that for many years has earmarked the openness-enclosure dichotomy. The combination of intellectual property scholarship and documentation theory provides important new insight into the historical networks and processes by which patents and documents have consolidated and converged during the twentieth century.",2019,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science
"Nantkwest, Inc. v. Matal",; ,"Section 145 of the Patent Act provides that a patent applicant dissatisfied with a decision of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may appeal directly to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in lieu of immediate appeal to the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit. The assignee of a patent application directed to a method of treating cancer by administering natural killer cells decided to use the Section 145 process to appeal a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) affirming the patent examiner's rejection of the claims. After prevailing on the merits, the PTO filed a motion to recover $111,696.39 of the USPTO's fees ($78,592.50 in attorneys' fees (including paralegal fees) and $33,103.89 in expert fees), citing a provision of the statute that specifies that the applicant must pay all of the expenses of the proceeding, regardless of the outcome.'' The district court granted the Director's requested witness' fees but denied the requested attorneys' fees, finding that under the American Rule'' the statute did not authorize an award of attorneys' fees. In a manner of first impression, the Federal Circuit reversed, and held that all expenses of the proceedings'' includes the pro rata share of the attorneys' fees the USPTO incurred to defend applicant's appeal. The court acknowledged the heavy economic burden'' that 145 shifts onto applicants for electing this favorable appellate path.'' [One way in which the 145 path is favorable, for example, is that under Kappos v. Hyatt, 132 S. Ct. 1690 (2012), the patent applicant is permitted to introduce new evidence in 145 proceeding that would not be considered in an appeal taken directly to the Federal Circuit.]",2017,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology
CASTING ASPERSIONS IN PATENT TRIALS,; JURY,"Bad actors in patent litigation can face serious consequences. Infringers who are found to infringe willfully may be subject to treble damages. Patentees who assert weak claims in bad faith can be ordered to pay the defendant's attorneys' fees. These remedies are of such importance to the patent system today that the Supreme Court reinvigorated both respective doctrines in back-to-back landmark decisions in 2014 (Octane Fitness) and 2016 (Halo Electronics). Those decisions have helped district courts more effectively punish and deter misconduct. But the Supreme Court neglected to address a critical part of these remedies-whether and to what extent they should be tried to a jury. Under current law, willfulness can be tried to a jury but bad-faith enforcement cannot. This means that plaintiffs alone can legitimately cast aspersions at defendants that profoundly color the case and the jury's views",2017,Government & Law
Relation Between End-Procedural Activated Clotting Time Values and Radial Artery Occlusion Rate With Standard Fixed-Dose Heparin After Transradial Cardiac Catheterization,; PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY PROCEDURES; VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS; ANGIOGRAPHY; ANGIOPLASTY; PREVENTION; WEIGHT; ACCESS; ANTICOAGULATION; INTERVENTIONS; COMPRESSION,"Although heparin administration has reduced the incidence of radial artery occlusion (RAO) during the transradial coronary angiography (TRCA), the effective activated clotting time (ACT) value for guiding unfractionated heparin dosing in patients undergoing TRCA is unknown. Four hundred thirty-two patients who were scheduled for elective TRCA were enrolled in our prospective study. All the patients received a standard dose of 5,000 IU unfractionated heparin. Anticoagulation level was assessed by ACT measurements that were taken at the end of the procedure just before the sheath removal. The day after TRCA, all patients were evaluated by color Doppler ultrasound to detect RAO. RAO was found in 29 patients (6.7%). A median ACT of 205 seconds in the RAO group and 265 seconds in the radial artery patent group were detected (p <0.001). Mean procedure duration was significantly longer in the RAO group than in the radial artery patent group (18.55 +/- 9.80 vs 11.24 +/- 7.07 minutes, p <0.001). There was a negative correlation between end-procedural ACT and procedure duration (r = -0.117, p = 0.015). In multivariate analysis, end-procedural ACT (odds ratio 0.981, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.972 to 0.989, p <0.001), procedure duration (odds ratio 1.076, 95% CI, 1.037 to 1.116, p <0.001), and radial artery diameter (odds ratio 0.240, 95% CI 0.063 to 0.907, p = 0.035) were found as independent predictors of RAO. In conclusion, shorter end-procedural ACT levels, longer procedural duration, and smaller radial arterial diameter were independently associated with RAOs after TRCA with standard-dose heparin. In prolonged procedures, ACT-based heparin dosing may be useful to overcome RAO. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2016,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Merging the Different View-Points. Concluding Remarks,; ,"This last chapter is a general overview on the impact of the European law on the domestic regulations of participatory rights. Mostly inspired by a part of the Attachment, submitted to the national rapporteurs, this chapter aims at pointing out two main features. First, the patent impact that the European law, both the ECHR and the EU law, had during the recent decades on national set-ups of participatory rights in criminal procedure. Second, the multifold pattern by which the European law affected local jurisdictions, inducing different reactions and attitudes within the analysed legal contexts. Such a normative evolution happened against a fast-changing background, in which people tend to move more frequently and where presence at trial may be put in balance with new needs and expectations.",2019,Criminology & Penology; Government & Law

Among his many contributions, Posner offered an early conjecture that remains fascinating and controversial to this day: the idea that common law rules are more likely than legislative codes to be concerned with efficiency. In this paper, I compare the efficiency of a common law rule of contracting to the efficiency of a civil law rule. In common law jurisdictions, claimants must have knowledge of a reward in order to recover. In civil law jurisdictions, however, no such knowledge is required. I analyze the efficiency of each rule by examining the incentives created by each rule. In a finding that agrees with Posner's hypothesis, I argue that the common law rule is more efficient. The model has a number of applications beyond contract default laws. I use the model to discuss three legal questions previously analyzed by Richard Posner: (1) incentivizing innovation; (2) the finders-keepers rule in property law; and (3) salvage rights in maritime law.",2017,Business & Economics; Government & Law
Corporate Social Responsibility of Pharmaceutical Industry Towards Access to Medicine: A Case Study of GlaxoSmithKline,; HEALTH DIPLOMACY; ADHERENCE; FRAMEWORK; THERAPY; DRUGS,India has changed its patent policy in 2005. It was compliance to WTO TRIPs provision and after this there was prohibition on process or generic manufacturing. India is the biggest supplier of affordable generic medicines and this patent protection is said to be beneficial to novel drug manufacturing countries. The generic drugs can be a differentiation factor between lives starting point and the ending point for millions of people in developing countries. This remains an obstacle to inexpensive generic medicines which results in devastating impact on the poorer people. These patent laws allow large MNC's to place 'profits over people'.

THE BAYH-DOLE ACT & PUBLIC RIGHTS IN FEDERALLY FUNDED INVENTIONS: WILL THE AGENCIES EVER GO MARCHING IN?,; BOUNDED RATIONALITY,"For over thirty years, the Bayh-Dole Act has granted federal agencies the power to force the recipients of federal research funding to license the resulting inventions to third parties. Despite having this expansive power, no federal agency has ever seen fit to utilize it. This Note explores why Bayh-Dole march-in rights have never been used, and proposes reforms that would help ensure that, in the instances when they are most required, the public is able to access the inventions it bankrolled. There have been five documented march-in petitions since the Bayh-Dole Act was passed into law. Each petition was dismissed by the funding agency without progressing to the march-in proceeding stage. Even if one of these petitions had made it to the proceeding stage it is unlikely that a march-in would have occurred. The Bayh-Dole Act's march-in rights are designed in such a manner that makes their effective use highly unlikely. Procedurally, they offer expansive protections for patent holders and few safeguards for those who petition for march-in. A few minor reforms to the system could help appropriately balance the march-in system's design. Potential reforms include instituting an appeal process, mandating a duty to use best efforts to bring subject inventions to the point of practical application and report on those efforts, clarifying the meaning of Bayh-Dole's reasonable terms requirement, and instituting a requirement that subject inventions be marketed in the United States at internationally competitive rates. In addition, a requirement that subject inventions be licensed via public auction rather than private negotiation would help ensure that those best suited to commercializing inventions have the chance to secure the rights to them.",2015,Government & Law
Reconceptualizing the Role of Intellectual Property Rights in Shaping Industry Structure,; INNOVATION; PATENTS; ANTITRUST; COPYRIGHT; BIOTECHNOLOGY; COMPETITION; IMPACT; MUSIC; ENTRY; LAW,"Technological and creative industries are critical to economic and social welfare, and the forces that shape such industries are important subjects of legal and policy examination. These industries depend on patents and copyrights, and scholars have long debated whether exclusive rights promote industry consolidation (by shoring up barriers to entry) or fragmentation (by promoting entry of new firms). Much hangs in the balance, for the structure of these IP-intensive industries can determine the amount, variety, and quality of drugs, food, software, movies, music, and books available to society. This Article reconceptualizes the role of patents and copyrights in shaping industry structure by examining empirical profiles of six IP-intensive industries: biopharmaceuticals; agricultural biotechnology, seeds, and agrochemicals; software; film production and distribution; music recording; and book publishing. It reveals that exclusive rights play multiple roles in influencing industry structure, and it distinguishes their effects along two underappreciated dimensions. First, it distinguishes the effects of exclusive rights at different times, arguing that patents and copyrights contribute to the initial entry of new firms, particularly in young fields, but that over time exclusive rights facilitate industry concentration by erecting barriers to entry and serving as assets that incumbents seek to amass in mergers and acquisitions. Second, it distinguishes along the value chain within any given industry, arguing that exclusive rights most prominently promote entry in upstream creative functions-from creating biologic compounds to producing movies-while tending to contribute to concentration in downstream functions focused on commercialization, such as marketing and distributing drugs and movies. As a corollary, this Article shows that exclusive rights play multiple roles in shaping industry structure, from directly enabling entry or exclusion to subtly influencing firm behavior in ways that advance fragmentation or concentration. This Article provides legal and policy decisionmakers with a more robust understanding of how patents and copyrights contribute in myriad ways to both fragmentation and concentration, depending on context. Drawing on these insights, it explores potential interventions from antitrust law and reforms to intellectual property law-including conditioning the acquisition of exclusive rights on the size and market position of a rights holder-to ensure robust competition and innovation.",2019,Government & Law
"Intellectual property rights and challenges for development of affordable human papillomavirus, rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines: Patent landscaping and perspectives of developing country vaccine manufacturers",Vaccines; Intellectual property rights; Gavi the Vaccine Alliance; Human papillomavirus vaccines; Rotavirus vaccines; Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines; Trade; Patents; Vaccine manufacturers; Developing country manufacturers; ,"The success of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance depends on the vaccine markets providing appropriate, affordable vaccines at sufficient and reliable quantities. Gavi's current supplier base for new and underutilized vaccines, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV), rotavirus, and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is very small. There is growing concern that following globalization of laws on intellectual property rights (IPRs) through trade agreements, IPRs are impeding new manufacturers from entering the market with competing vaccines. This article examines the extent to which IPRs, specifically patents, can create such obstacles, in particular for developing country vaccine manufacturers (DCVMs). Through building patent landscapes in Brazil, China, and India and interviews with manufacturers and experts in the field, we found intense patenting activity for the HPV and pneumococcal vaccines that could potentially delay the entry of new manufacturers. Increased transparency around patenting of vaccine technologies, stricter patentability criteria suited for local development needs and strengthening of IPRs management capabilities where relevant, may help reduce impediments to market entry for new manufacturers and ensure a competitive supplier base for quality vaccines at sustainably low prices.

Plant Patents in the European Union: Recent Developments,Breeders' rights; Plant Patents; Biotechnological inventions; plant varieties; agricultural innovation; ,"Biotechnology has become one of the most promising and important technologies for the development of innovation in agriculture. The economic importance of the invested resources justifies that innovators ask for an adequate means of protection to compensate their efforts. There are two possible ways of protection of the developments in plant innovation: A sui generis system born in the middle of last century in order to protect the results of traditional breeding processes, on the one hand; and the patentability of plant inventions which normally are the result of biotechnological processes which operate at the cellular level. The coexistence of these two systems of protection in the European Union causes some frictions which have to be solved, not only by the legislator, but also by the courts and the patent offices when they apply the law to a constantly evolving reality.",2019,Government & Law

What's new in treatment of pancreatic cancer: a patent review (2010-2017),Cancer drug targets; cancer therapy; novel compounds; pancreatic cancer; patent; personalized medicine; PHASE-III TRIAL; EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; NAB-PACLITAXEL; TUMOR-GROWTH; GEMCITABINE; EXPRESSION; THERAPY; ADENOCARCINOMA; SURVIVAL; CARCINOMA,"Introduction: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal cancers, with a median overall survival of less than 1year and a 5-year survival of similar to 5%. The poor survival rate is likely due to lack of early diagnosis, fast disease course, high metastasis rate and disappointing treatment outcome. Therefore, at this stage, any new method that provides a treatment against PC without the undesirable side effects of chemotherapy and radiation is urgently needed. Areas covered: This review summarizes the latest advances in the treatment of PC through the patents published from 2010 to 2017. The patents reviewed include both new combinations of existing drugs and novel structures. New targets are proposed for developing new drugs. Expert opinion: The patents reviewed entail different approaches which, on the one hand, improve the administration of existing drugs and therapies and, on the other, develop new drugs to act on novel targets. However, most of the new methods are in the first stage of development and need to be tested in vivo, in pre-clinical approaches and in clinical trials. Therefore, further assays will help confirm the activity, mechanisms of action, drug-drug interactions and other aspects that make a compound a good antitumoral agent.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Evaluation and Influence of Brachiocephalic Branch Re-entry in Patients With Type A Acute Aortic Dissection,Aneurysm; Aorta; Dissection; PATENT FALSE LUMEN; ARCH REPLACEMENT; RISK ANALYSIS; REPAIR; SURGERY; GRAFT; HEMIARCH,"Background: Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (A-AAD) extends to the brachiocephalic branches in some patients. After ascending aortic replacement, a remaining re-entry tear in the distal brachiocephalic branches may act as an entry and result in a patent false lumen in the aortic arch. However, the effect of brachiocephalic branch re-entry concomitant with A-AAD remains unknown. Methods and Results: Eighty-five patients with A-AAD who underwent ascending aortic replacement in which both preoperative and postoperative multiple-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scans could be evaluated were retrospectively studied. The presence of a patent false lumen in at least one of the brachiocephalic branches on preoperative MDCT was defined as brachiocephalic branch re-entry, and 41 patients (48%) had this. Postoperatively, 47 of 85 (55%) patients had a patent false lumen in the aortic arch. False lumen remained patent after operation in 34 out of the 41 (83%) patients with brachiocephalic branch re-entry, as compared to that in 13 of the 44 (30%) patients without such re-entry (P<0.001). Brachiocephalic branch re-entry was a significant risk factor for a late increase in the aortic arch diameter greater than 10 mm (P=0.047). Conclusions: Brachiocephalic branch re-entry in patients with A-AAD is related to a patent false lumen in the aortic arch early after ascending aortic replacement and is a risk factor for late aortic arch enlargement.",2017,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Cross-Subsidies: Government's Hidden Pocketbook,; HEALTH-INSURANCE; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; INCOME-TAX; POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY; ADVERSE SELECTION; MANDATED BENEFITS; PUBLIC PROVISION; SELF-SELECTION; PRIVATE GOODS; IN-KIND,"Governments can use regulation to pay for public goods out of the pockets of consumers rather than taxpayers. For example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) underwrites care for women and the infirm through higher insurance premium payments by healthy men. Building on a classic article from Richard Posner, we show that these crosssubsidies between consumers are a common feature of modern law, ranging from telecommunications to intellectual property to employee benefits. Critics of the ACA, and even some of its supporters, argue that taxes would be a better choice. Taxes are said to be more transparent and to fit better with the recommendations of public finance economics. We show how these same arguments can be extended to many other contemporary cross-subsidies. We also argue, however, that the critics may well be wrong. Drawing on recent theoretical and empirical advances, we show that cross-subsidies can be more efficient than taxes, especially when they are used to redistribute wealth on grounds other than income, such as the ACA's transfer from men to women. We then apply our analysis to several key contemporary cross-subsidies, including personal injury law, patents, class action lawsuits, paid family leave, and, of course, the ACA.",2018,Government & Law
Rigorous Policy Pilots: Experimentation in the Administration of the Law,; TRIALS; RISK,"Rigorous tests are being used every day to develop effective medical treatments, drive consumer engagement, and, more generally, discover what works. But so far, rigorous policy piloting-temporarily introducing a change in law or policy in order to learn from it using well-designed and well-implemented methods-has not been used widely because of the perception that policy experimentation is unfair and possibly illegal, difficult, and rare. This Essay draws upon case law and agency practice to show that, to the contrary, rigorous policy pilots are presumptively legal, feasible, and increasingly common, proceeding in several steps. First, it finds that many kinds of pilots, including those that vary internal agency processes, or which are opt-in are unlikely to be controversial. But a review of relevant cases suggests that courts are likely to uphold even pilots that treat like members of a population differently, including through randomization, when they advance learning. Further, it finds experimentation, by itself, to be unlikely to create special procedural or substantive hurdles. Second, it finds that agencies are engaging in a range of rigorous piloting activities to fill informational gaps in policy- and law-making, some of which simulate and others which effect policy variation on a temporary basis, and that developments such as the growth of open data are making such forms of information gathering easier. It draws from agency experience to develop a framework for proposing a policy pilot and identify steps that would further support the use of rigorous pilots. A companion online appendix applies this framework to propose several rigorous pilots that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), building on its already strong tradition of piloting, to evolve its own policies and practices with respect to patent quality (through the robust vetting of applications in view of non-patent literature and team/time examination on demand) and inclusion in innovation (through automated error correction and addressing gender bias in examination).",2019,Government & Law
Standard-Essential Patents and the Distribution of Gains from Trade for Innovation,; GOVERNANCE; GERMANY; GRAVITY; IMPACT,"An earlier study finds that standard-essential patents (SEPs) enhance trade and additionally lead to a phenomenon of global cross-licensing; that is, global value chains (GVCs) arise along those countries in which companies will act as both the licensor and licensee of SEPs. This, however, simultaneously leads to the situation that SEP-induced GVCs are a relatively closed-off club of companies that profit from the artificial temporary monopoly awarded by patents and their connection to standards. This chapter proposes several paths for future research with the goal to uncover the micro-mechanisms of these findings. The principal questions asked are: (1) How can intermediate producers (i.e., global network suppliers, for instance, in Korea and China) profit from GVCs in which many SEPs are used? (2) How is upgrading (i.e., moving up in the GVC toward performing more elaborated tasks) in an SEP-induced GVC possible? (3) How can a company reach a position that allows it to exert control over a GVC?",2018,Business & Economics; International Relations
The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree in IP Law,; PATENT; INFRINGEMENT; PUNISHMENT; ECONOMICS; CRIME,"If a police officer searches my home illegally and finds evidence of a crime there, the criminal law suppresses not only that evidence, but evidence derived from the search that was not itself found illegally. This doctrine is known as the 'fruit of the poisonous tree. The animating principle of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is but-for causation: If you had not violated the law, you wouldn't have found the evidence, and so you wouldn't have followed whatever investigative path was triggered by the finding of that evidence. The newly discovered evidence the fruit is tainted by the poison of the illegal search. Intellectual property (IP) regimes face this issue when defendants infringe an IP right in the course of making a product that does not itself infringe that right. IP law is all over the map in dealing with such cases. Some IP regimes, like trade secret law, apply the fruit of the poisonous tree logic, allowing the plaintiff to recover not only for the profits the defendant made from secrets she actually stole and used but also for the profits of any product that resulted from the use of those secrets. Copyright law, by contrast, does not permit a plaintiff either to obtain an injunction or to recover damages against non infringing final products. Patent law is somewhere in between. In this Essay, I offer a cohesive way to think about the fruit of the poisonous tree in IP law. Whether IP remedies should extend to tainted but non infringing products should be a function of the mental state of the infringer, the likelihood that infringement will be detected, and the contribution made by the final, non-infringing product. Balancing those three factors won't necessarily lead all IP regimes to treat the fruit of the poisonous tree in the same way. But it does both explain and suggest some needed reforms to the current legal rules.",2017,Government & Law

In the empirical analysis, inventors' knowledge sourcing strategies are employed as explanatory factors for their inventive performance. The results suggest that both the separate and joint use of external scientific and market knowledge are positively and significantly associated with inventors' quantity and quality of inventions. In addition, higher levels of education act as a moderating factor of the joint use of scientific and market knowledge. Tracing a positive link between external knowledge and individual inventive process is relevant for research as well as policy, considering that knowledge exchange across a wide range of organisations is at the core of the innovation policy agendas in most countries.",2019,Engineering; Business & Economics
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW AND THE RIGHT TO REPAIR,; FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL CONCEPTIONS; FAIR-USE; PATENT SCOPE; NATURAL LAW; COPYRIGHT; PREEMPTION; POLICY; INNOVATION; ANTITRUST; PROGRESS,"This Article posits that intellectual property law should accommodate consumers' right to repair their products. In recent years, there has been a growing push towards state legislation that would provide consumers with a right to repair their products. Currently, twenty states have pending legislation that would require product manufacturers to make available replacement parts and repair manuals. Unfortunately, though, this legislation has stalled in many of the states. Manufacturers have been lobbying the legislatures to stop the enactment of these repair laws based on different concerns, including how these laws may impinge on their intellectual property rights. Indeed, a right to repair may not be easily reconcilable with the United States' far-reaching intellectual property rights regime. For example, requiring manufacturers to release repair manuals could implicate a whole host of intellectual property laws, including trade secrets. Similarly, employing measures that undercut a manufacturer's control of the market for replacement parts might conflict with patent exclusivity. Nonetheless, this Article holds that intellectual property laws should not be used to prevent a right to repair from being fully implemented. In support of this claim, this Article develops a theoretical framework that justifies a right to repair in a manner that is consistent with intellectual property protection. Based on this theoretical foundation, this Article then explores, for the first time, the various intellectual property rules and doctrines that may be implicated in the context of the current repair movement. As part of this analysis, this Article identifies areas where intellectual property rights could prevent repair laws from being fully realized, even if some of the states pass the legislation, and recommends certain reforms that are necessary to accommodate the need for a right to repair and enable it to take hold.",2019,Government & Law
CONFUSION LIKELY: STANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES UNDER THE LANHAM ACT,; ,"When a trademark registered with the Patent and Trademark Office is infringed, section 32 of the Lanham Act provides the trademark registrant the opportunity to seek remedies in federal court. Thanks to a broad definition of registrant, the Act in fact extends standing beyond the registrant herself to her legal representatives, among others. This language has prompted courts to puzzle over the proper definition of a legal representative. Through their varying interpretations, they have erected unpredictable barriers to standing in the trademark-infringement context. Affording most attention to the Second Circuit's recent decision to deny standing to a claimed legal representative of the Russian Federation, this Note critically examines the different legal representative definitions proffered by the courts in light of standing doctrine and the Lanham Act's history. Concluding that the proper legal representative definition reflects the goals of the Lanham Act's architects and, to best do so, is bound only by constitutional standing constraints, this Note advocates for a low barrier to third-party standing.",2015,Government & Law

Do March-In Rights Ensure Access to Medical Products Arising From Federally Funded Research? A Qualitative Study,march-in rights; Bayh-Dole Act; government-funded research; National Institutes of Health; BAYH-DOLE; DRUGS; INNOVATION; PATENTS; ROLES,"ContextThe high cost of new prescription drugs and other medical products is a growing health policy issue. Many of the most transformative drugs and vaccines had their origins in public-sector funding to nonprofit research institutions. Although the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 provides for march-in rights through which the government can invoke some degree of control over the patents protecting products developed from public funding to ensure public access to these medications, the applicability of this provision to current policy options is not clear. MethodsWe conducted a primary-source document review of the Bayh-Dole Act's legislative history as well as of hearings of past march-in rights petitions to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We then conducted semistructured interviews of 12 key experts in the march-in rights of the Bayh-Dole Act to identify the sources of the disputes and the main themes in the statute's implementation. We analyzed the interview transcripts using standard qualitative techniques. FindingsSince 1980, the NIH has fully reviewed only 5 petitions to invoke governmental march-in rights for 4 health-related technologies or medical products developed from federally funded research. Three of these requests related to reducing the high prices of brand-name drugs, one related to relieving a drug shortage, and one related to a potentially patent-infringing medical device. In each of these cases, the NIH rejected the requests. Interviewees were split on the implications of these experiences, finding the NIH's reluctance to implement its march-in rights to be evidence of either a system working as intended or of a flawed system needing reform. ConclusionsThe Bayh-Dole Act's march-in rights continue to be invoked by policymakers and health advocates, most recently in the context of new, high-cost products originally discovered with federally funded research. We found that the existence of march-in rights may select for government research licensees more likely to commercialize the results and that they can be used to extract minor concessions from licensees. But as currently specified in the statute, such march-in rights are unlikely to serve as a counterweight to lower the prices of medical products arising from federally funded research.",2015,Health Care Sciences & Services

Yet the Supreme Court has approached these areas from distinctly different angles. With copyright, the Court readily employs constitutional analysis, building fences to constrain Congress. With patent, it emphasizes statutory interpretation, demarcating paths the legislature can follow, or deviate from (potentially at its constitutional peril). This Article uses empirical and quantitative analysis to show this divergence. It offers two potential explanations, one based on entitlement strength, the other grounded in public choice concerns. Next, the Article explores border cases where the Court could have used either fences or paths, demonstrating the effects of this pattern. It sets out criteria that the Court should employ in choosing between these approaches: counter-majoritarian concerns, institutional competence, pragmatism, and avoidance theory. The Article argues that the key normative principle is that the Court should erect fences when cases impinge on intellectual property's core constitutional concerns information disclosure for patent and information generation for copyright. It concludes with two examples where the Court should alter its approach based on this principle.",2019,Government & Law

The request of St. Vincent and the Grenadines to simultaneously appoint its resident High Commissioner to London as its non-resident Ambassador to Pyongyang had to be opposed by the British Foreign Office despite the fact that St. Vincent was not a party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, while London had to consider breaking the provisions of the 1883 Paris Convention in order not to recognize the 'right of priority' of patents which had been approved in Pyongyang as was required. Also, North Korea's stated intention to join the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization and therefore establish its permanent mission in London forced the Foreign Office to attempt to block North Korea's admittance to the IMCO despite the principle of universality of international organizations, while Britain's inability to talk directly to the North Koreans deprived London of an important means with which to stop North Korean military aid from arriving in Zimbabwe.",2018,History
Institutional Regime Shift in Intellectual Property Rights and Innovation Strategies of Firms in China,intellectual property rights; innovation strategy; institutional change; emerging economy; China; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CULTURAL DISTANCE; PATENT RIGHTS; TRANSITION; KNOWLEDGE; NETWORKS; SURVIVAL; EMBEDDEDNESS; LIABILITY,"This study develops a novel conceptual framework to understand the differential impact of formal institutional regime shift in intellectual property rights on the innovation and patenting strategies of Chinese and Western firms operating in China. We argue that to the extent that Chinese firms have been deeply embedded in China's informal institutions, they are less responsive to formal institutional changes than Western firms operating in China. Using the major China patent law reform of 2001 as an exogenous event, we find results consistent with our key arguments: With the strengthening of the previously weak ( utility model) patent protection, Chinese firms are less likely to apply for such patents to safeguard their innovations than Western firms. However, this difference becomes less pronounced in regions with higher quality intellectual property rights and legal institutions that foster research and development and innovation, and when Western firms gain longer operational experience in China. This study advances our understanding of the intricate interaction between formal and informal institutions and specifically how stickiness may arise in their substitutive relationship because of the embeddedness of firms in informal institutional environments. It also provides important implications for policy and innovation strategies for policy makers and firms in emerging economies.",2017,Business & Economics
"Wireless at the Bar: Experts, Circuits and Marconi's Inventions in Patent Disputes in Early Twentieth-Century Britain",Wireless telegraphy; Intellectual property; Law courts; Experts; Innovation; ,"This chapter brings together the law and the relevant institutions at the center of the analysis, with the aim of shedding light on the culture of invention as it developed and, eventually, prevailed in the field of wireless technology. It supplements the existing historiography of the wireless industry in Britain in the early twentieth century which focuses on the business strategies, the development and economics of manufacture and the role of corporate R&D in technological transitions, as well as that of contracts and agreements in a national and international setting. Inventorship in the industrial setting of wireless is reconstructed as a complex activity that was formed through the performance, agency and, most importantly, interaction of various experts and actors. The management of Marconi's inventions involved circulation of knowledge, expertise, credit and trust in various locations: the laboratory, the public sphere of technical journals and the law courts. The case study in this chapter concerns the making of a patent, and a strong monopoly, through the decision-making process of the British law courts. The story argues that Marconi's success in the Marconi vs British Radio Telegraph and Telephone Company court case was the result of preparation and organization, and the use of experts who combined scientific, practical and legal credibility. Despite the ideologically driven public discourse on the cognitive and social superiority of science over invention and practice, in the law courts a mixture of scientific authority and practical experience provided credible witnessing.",2015,History & Philosophy of Science
Transatlantic (F)RANDs and Converging Standards: Finding Balance Between Jurisdictions in International Standard Setting,; PATENT; INNOVATION,"The Microsoft v. Motorola cases in U.S. federal court and transformative developments in enforcement activity by the European Commission antitrust authorities have created a new dynamic intersection between competition and intellectual property law. This legal juncture focuses on a patent holder's reasonable and non-discriminatory, or RAND, commitments to standard setting organizations. These organizations play a vital role as global platforms for innovation, partnerships, creation of efficiencies, and reduction of costs through agreement on standards across borders. How courts, scholars, and regulators interpret RAND language and enforce the agreements influences the distribution of liability between parties, the commercial incentives to develop technologies and participate in collaborative standards, and ultimately the continued viability of international standard setting regimes. This Note analyzes emerging quantitative and qualitative understandings of RAND and makes two connected, resulting contentions. First, it argues that any legal framework consistent across judicial and regulatory spaces must promote a flexible model for licensing negotiation that properly considers the incentives of standard essential patent holders as it binds them to license at fair rates. Second, it considers opportunities for reconciliation between the developing regimes for license negotiations in the United States and the European Union and asserts that convergence in practice should motivate further evolution of this crucial cross-border intersection of market regulation, law, and technological innovation.",2016,International Relations; Government & Law
National culture and corporate innovation,National culture; Corporate innovation; Individualism; Uncertainty-avoidance; Innovation efficiency; OWNERSHIP; BUSINESS; QUALITY; VALUES; LAW,"In this paper, we examine how cultural norms along the dimensions of individualism-collectivism and uncertainty-avoidance affect corporate innovation. Using a comprehensive sample across 41 countries, we find that firms located in countries with higher levels of individualism generate more and higher impact patents, and are more efficient in converting R & D into innovative output. In contrast, we find that firms located in countries with higher levels of uncertainty avoidance produce fewer and less significant patents, and are less efficient with their R & D expenditure. Taken together, our findings show that national culture plays an important role in influencing corporate innovation around the world.",2017,Business & Economics

Indian Patent Law and Its Impact on the Pharmaceutical Industry: What Can China Learn from India?,Patent; Pharmaceutical industry; Generic drug; Compulsory license; Bolar exception; Evergreening; ,"Both China and India are developing countries in the pharmaceutical industry, and both need to seek a balance between protecting intellectual property rights and satisfying people's healthcare needs. They also need to promote innovation and encourage the development of domestic industries. As members of the WTO, China and India have made a series of amendments to their respective intellectual property systems to live up to the TRIPS Agreement's minimum standards of protection, including recognition of pharmaceutical product patents, introduction of a compulsory licensing system, and Bolar exception. In promoting the development of its domestic pharmaceutical industry, India's experience in legislation and judicial practice deserves serious attention from China, such as using TRIPS's flexibility to facilitate access to medicines, implementing compulsory licensing to create more chances for voluntary licensing negotiation, and updating the guidelines for examining pharmaceutical applications to prevent ever-greening of pharmaceutical patents. Meanwhile, learning from India, China should start to provide its legal professionals with knowledge of global rules, to better further Chinese interests in the world arena.",2019,Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law
Patentability Standards for Follow-On Pharmaceutical Innovation,UNDP; patentability guidelines; patent examination; pharmaceutical patents; TRIPS Agreement; DRUGS,"Follow-on pharmaceutical innovation occurring after the initial discovery of a drug active ingredient plays an important, but at times underappreciated, role in providing innovative solutions to compelling medical needs. Examples of follow-on innovation include new forms of a drug with improved safety-efficacy profiles, new formulations and dosages providing improved patient outcomes, and new methods of using an established drug more safely or to treat new indications. Patents play a critical role in incentivizing the research, development, testing, and ultimately commercialization of follow-on pharmaceutical innovation, and in doing so provide substantial benefits for public health and patients' quality of life. There is, however, a body of literature characterizing patents directed towards follow-on innovations as secondary pharmaceutical patents. Some have even gone so far as to propose that the criteria for patentability should be enforced more stringently with respect to follow-on pharmaceutical inventions as compared to other inventions. The underlying assumption of such proposals is that follow-on pharmaceutical innovations are somehow secondary to other pharmaceutical innovation, and thus less deserving of patent protection. In this article, we refute the notion that follow-on pharmaceutical innovation should be categorically singled out for unfavorable treatment under the patent laws, and provide numerous examples of the value that follow-on innovation brings to medicine, and ultimately to patients. We also propose, in view of the international treaty obligations set out in, inter alia, the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), standards and best practices for assessing the patentability of inventions arising out of follow-on pharmaceutical innovation. These are essentially the same stringent standards applicable to primary pharmaceutical innovation, and inventions in general. This article provides numerous examples from jurisdictions around the world in which patent offices and courts have applied the well-recognized requirements of patentability, including patent eligibility, novelty, inventive step and industrial application, to follow-on pharmaceutical inventions, and in so doing have advanced innovation in public health and ultimately the lives of patients.",2018,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

CBA AT THE PTO,; INNOVATION; PATENTS; SYSTEM,"What are the costs and benefits of patent laws? While Congress and the courts are often able to evade this difficult question, there is one institutional actor that is not only well-advised but also required to consider costs and benefits: the Patent and Trademark Office, which-as an administrative agency-is required by executive order to conduct cost-benefit analysis of all economically significant regulations. Yet the agency's efforts have been less than satisfactory. In its cost-benefit analysis, the PTO overlooks crucial functional considerations, misunderstands basic precepts of patent economics, and resists quantification when quantification is required. In combination, these shortcomings suggest that the PTO has not correctly measured the social costs and benefits of the rules it creates, in part because it has adopted an overly limited view of the welfare effects of intellectual property and the agency's own role in promoting or discouraging IP. In other instances, the PTO has promulgated rules that will likely have tremendous economic significance without recognizing their importance or conducting a cost-benefit analysis. These errors cast doubt on whether the PTO's regulations will increase or diminish social welfare. Before the PTO is granted any additional substantive authority, reform will be necessary.",2016,Government & Law
A new approach to explore the knowledge transition path in the evolution of science & technology: From the biology of restriction enzymes to their application in biotechnology,evolution of S&T; applications-oriented; D-A-T path; phase transition; environment of knowledge utilization; mediator set; JOURNAL DIFFUSION; HISTORICAL ROOTS; RESEARCH FIELDS; PATENTS; DNA,"In this contribution, we develop a new approach to explore the process of knowledge transition from discovery-oriented science to technological fields, via applications-oriented research, including a mediator set. This trajectory is referred to as the D-A-T trajectory. It is shown how it can be constructed and measures are proposed to characterize the relational strength among different environments (discovery oriented research, applications-oriented research and patents) and the speed of evolution. Our approach is illustrated by a case study of three fundamental restriction enzymes articles. Among other results we found that 387 patents cited 124 of the 988 articles (a share of 12.55%) in the mediator set. Defining the non-patent references (NPR) transition rate as the number of citing patents divided by the number of articles in the mediator set yields a value 0.392. Our results suggest that the D-A-T path acts as a backbone and reveals important invisible contributions of an original scientific work during its evolution from discovery oriented research to outside academia. Our contribution provides a useful tool for bridging the existing gap in detecting the transition of knowledge between science and technology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"What Can the FTC's Section 6(b) PAE Study Teach Us? A Practical Review of the Study's Methodology, Results, and Policy Recommendations",; PATENT; ENTITIES,"On October 6, 2016, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released its survey of patent assertion entities (PAEs) and certain licensing and manufacturing firms. The study, conducted under authority of Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, aimed to move past the limited information that can be gleaned from litigation records-an important goal given that over 90 percent of patent enforcement activity occurs outside the courtroom. By compiling and publishing nonpublic data on licensing agreements and patent acquisition practices from 2009 through 2013, the study provides new insight into how certain PAEs operate. The empirical approach the FTC took, however, does impose constraints on the study's reported results. And importantly, the report presents case studies that cannot be generalized, calling into question the policy recommendations that would apply to all patent infringement suits. This article summarizes the key findings reported by the FTC and explains how the study's methodology limits its conclusions and is disconnected from its policy recommendations. The study provides interesting case studies of certain PAE practices, particularly in terms of litigation. In regards to licensing practices, the study's design restricts its ability to provide definitive information, but does offer some intriguing hints at different types of PAEs and should inspire additional empirical research. The study results, however, do not provide empirical support for the stated policy proposals, and moreover the proposals would impact more than PAEs.",2017,Business & Economics; Government & Law
Renewed Efficiency in Administrative Patent Revocation,; ,"Administrative patent revocation in the U.S. is poised to enter a new period of efficiency, though ironically it will be an efficiency that the America Invents Act originally put in place. The Court's recent approval of the constitutionality of Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) proceedings was blunted by the Court's accompanying rejection of partial institution. This Patent Office practice of accepting and denying validity review petitions piecemeal had been a key part of the agency's procedural structure from the start. As a result, the Court's decision in SAS Institute v. Iancu to require a binary choice-either fully accepting a PTAB petition or fully denying it-is already being criticized for sacrificing efficiency on the altar of wooden statutory interpretation, including two dissents from the decision itself Starting from the premise that SAS Institute was rightly decided, however, this paper makes two contributions. The theoretical contribution is to contrast PTAB estoppel with ordinary principles of res judicator and collateral estoppel. This important context is lacking in the literature, and the profound effect of SAS Institute on PTAB estoppel makes this evaluation especially timely. The empirical contribution is to marshal new data and guide the difficult structural choices that the agency must now make in order to comply with SAS Institute. Notably, though Justice Ginsburg's dissent suggested that the agency could comply with the Court's decision through a few empty gestures, her mock proposal is actually a sound plan of action. By reinvigorating Congress's view of efficiency, one that is more systemic than merely minimizing short-term agency workload, the Court has enabled the Patent Office to resolve open questions about the maturing system for resolving patent validity through administrative, rather than judicial, process.",2019,Government & Law

DYRK1A hyperactivity appears to contribute to the development of a number of human malignancies and to cognitive deficits observed in Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. As a result, the DYRK1A kinase represents an attractive target for the synthesis and optimization of pharmacological inhibitors of potential therapeutic interest. Like most tyrosine kinase inhibitors developed up to the market, DYRK1A inhibitors are essentially acting by competing with ATP for binding at the catalytic site of the kinase. Areas covered: This paper reviews patent activity associated with the discovery of synthetic novel heterocyclic molecules inhibiting the catalytic activity of DYRK1A. Expert opinion: Despite the important role of DYRK1A in biological processes and the growing interest in the design of new therapeutic drugs, there are only few patented synthetic DYRK1A inhibitors and most of them were and are still developed by academic research groups, sometimes with industrial partners.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Institutional complementarities between labour laws and innovation,; EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION LEGISLATION; WRONGFUL-DISCHARGE LAWS; MARKET; FLEXIBILITY; PROPERTY; COSTS,"We analyse how institutional complementarities between employee representation laws and dismissal restrictions influence aggregate innovation outcomes. We argue that greater employee voice, due to improved employee representation legislations, may spur innovative effort by employees only when shareholders cannot renegotiate ex-ante agreements with workers over revenue sharing, by threatening dismissal. We perform a panel regression analysis, exploiting country-sector panel data over the 1977-2005 period, and find that stronger employee representation laws in the presence of stricter firing restrictions are in fact associated with higher patenting activity. Consistently with our theoretical argument, the magnitude of this empirical relationship is seen to be relatively larger in those sectors where the human capital contribution to production is higher. Implications for the analysis of economic institutions and for legal policy making are proposed.",2019,Business & Economics
"Deadlines, Workflows, Task Sorting, and Work Quality",time pressure; innovation; productivity; deadlines; incentives; INCENTIVE CONTRACTS; DECISION-MAKING; TIME-PRESSURE; PATENT; PERFORMANCE; CHOICE,"Deadlines are often used to manage the time of valuable human capital. In this multimethod paper, we propose a theoretical framework grounded in a formal model that encapsulates the key drivers and consequences of deadline-related time pressures on workflows, task sorting, and work quality. We use large-scale data on patent filings, along with insights from primary data collection, to test our hypotheses. In line with our predictions, we find clustering of patent filings around month-ends, with month-end applications being more complex than those filed on other days. Consistent with time pressure reducing work quality, we find that work quality is lower for tasks completed at month-ends, more so for process measures of quality than for outcome measures. Calibration of our model to the data allows us to shed light on the benefits of deadlines and suggests small levels of task acceleration but potentially larger working capital-related benefits for law firms.",2018,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
Redundancy: When Law Repeats Itself,; STATUTORY INTERPRETATION; HABEAS-CORPUS; CANONS; COURTS; RULES; ENFORCEMENT; STANDARDS; INVENTION; DOCTRINE; CONTRACT,"The idea that law should generally be understood or designed to minimize redundancy informs much legal reasoning. Judges frequently. invoke anti redundancy principles in the interpretation of legal language, whether it appears in classic private-law documents such as contracts or classic public law documents such as constitutions and statutes. Such invocations of anti redundancy principles merit scrutiny. The canon against surplusage, an interpretive canon commonly deployed in the interpretation of constitutions, statutes, and contracts, provides an example of both an anti-redundancy principle and the capacity of such a principle to run contrary to actual practice. Among fields of law, modern patent law offers particularly dramatic examples of how excessive adherence to anti-redundancy can lead to perverse or otherwise unintended results. Patent law also illustrates how, despite frequent invocation of anti-redundancy principles, legal redundancy in the form of functionally overlapping language, doctrines, processes, and institutions remains ubiquitous. The pervasiveness of legal redundancy has at least one straightforward explanation. Redundancy has much to offer. As engineers, biologists, linguists, and information theorists have long appreciated, redundancy can help secure key interests, prevent or correct errors, enable nuance, and foster evolutionary potential. Hence, in a complex society, redundancy is a crucial tool of legal design. Of course, redundancy can be overdone. But instead of enjoying presumptive hegemony, anti-redundancy principles should generally be contextually confined to condemnation of excessive or otherwise problematic redundancy, rather than redundancy per se. In the development and application of law, anti-redundancy should often be no more than a factor, as opposed to a source of general presumption. Particularly when law mediates between competing interests of comparable social weight, anti redundancy can have merit. Nonetheless, even in such situations, smart legal design, as through the layering of rule-like safe harbors over comparatively vague standards, can employ redundancy while satisfying anti-redundancy concerns. Generally speaking, opportunities for intelligent design mean that legal policy. makers and decision makers should not seek to banish redundancy, but instead work to optimize its use.",2016,Government & Law
The future of three-dimensional printing: Intellectual property or intellectual confinement?,Copyright; digital rights management; fair use; innovation; intellectual property; open source; participatory culture; patent; peer production; three-dimensional printing; ,"For the first 25 years, three-dimensional printing was the domain of industrial manufacturing and engineering. Through the open-source movement and peer production, this disruptive technology has become more widely available. This article considers how the future development and use of three-dimensional printing may be facilitated or inhibited through intellectual property law and practice. Using a combination of technical, legal, and policy analysis, we conclude that the potential for patent infringement is a primary issue in the continued development of three-dimensional printing technology. When it comes to the printed objects themselves, copyright issues will be the main focus of this debate. As these issues become more pervasive, some copyright holders will find technology-based solutions to enforce copyright laws and restrict printing activities. A common recourse is digital rights management as a means for protecting intellectual property, but its use has the potential for imposing unnecessarily stringent limitations on the use of three-dimensional printing.",2016,Communication

In this contribution I will outline ethical and patenting problems that arise when working with pluripotent stem cells, specifically in the modern field of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. The focus will be on stem cell potentiality, and I will argue that potentiality rather than the act of sacrificing embryos will have to be a central point of concern in stem cell ethics and patenting in the future. Possible solutions will be discussed. When somatic cells are reprogrammed to gain full pluripotency, they acquire (so to say as a by-product) the capability to form viable embryos if tetraploid complementation (TC) is performed (termed gold standard by some authors). I argue that any human cells possessing this capability cannot be patented. In analogy to the arguments used by the EU-CJ, this must apply not only to patenting cell lines themselves but also to patenting technologies using these cells. The patenting problem is more than an obstacle for researchers and companies: It points to an ethical problem behind. The fact that the problem is being created by the process of iPSC induction asks for alternative strategies of stem cell derivation as well as for stringent criteria how to define and to test pluripotency vs. lower levels of potentiality. It will have to be discussed which genes should be seen here as crucial (e.g. genes involved in early embryonic pattern formation / self-organization processes). For ethical reasons it cannot be defended to use TC as a test for full pluripotency with human cells. It is thus necessary to discuss alternative test criteria. Recent reports suggest that it may indeed be possible to directly induce lower degrees of potentiality (e.g. multipotency) while bypassing a pluripotent state, thus avoiding the addressed problems. It appears timely and prudent, therefore, to redefine goals and to refocus strategies for stem cell derivation, in addition to stem cell quality testing criteria, in order to avoid the ethical and patenting dilemma.",2015,Cell Biology; Materials Science
Collegial oligarchy and networks of normative alignments in transnational institution building,Relational infrastructures; Institutional entrepreneurs; Collegial oligarchy; Normative alignments; European Unified Patent Court; SOCIETY; PATENTS; LAW,"This paper presents a combined relational and cultural approach to transnational institution building by focusing on a network analysis of a small collegial oligarchy and normative alignments among its peers. To contribute to a theory of institutionalization, we propose hypotheses about whom professionals as institutional entrepreneurs are likely to select as members of their collegial oligarchy, about the role of social networks among them in identifying these leaders, and about the costs. of alignments on these leaders' normative choices. We test these hypotheses using mainly Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) applied to a dataset including network information and normative choices collected at the so-called Venice Forum - a field-configuring event that was central in creating and mobilizing a network of European patent judges for the construction of a new transnational institution, the European Unified Patent Court. We track normative alignments on the collegial hierarchy in this network of judges and their divergent interpretations of the contemporary European patent. Highlighting this under-examined articulation of relational infrastructures and cultural framing in transnational institutionalization shows how Northern European forms of capitalism tend to dominate in this institutionalization process at the expense of the Southern European forms. It also helps reflect on the usefulness of analyses of small networks of powerful players in organizational societies, where power and influence are highly concentrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Collection and Remanufacturing of Waste Products under Patent Protection and Government Regulation,patent protection; reward-penalty policy; remanufacturing; closed-loop supply chain (CLSC); waste collection; LOOP SUPPLY CHAIN; STRATEGY,"There is increasing academic and pragmatic interest in leveraging patent rights to invigorate remanufacturing for waste products under governmental interventions via regulations and reward-penalty instruments. In practice, many original manufacturers that are possessed with intellectual property rights allow third-party remanufacturers to implement reproducing operations through authorization and charging licensing fees. The general purpose of this paper is to explore favorable strategies for a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) system of waste product collection and remanufacturing, in the context of either manufacturer-remanufacturing or remanufacturer-remanufacturing. To achieve such an objective, game theory is adopted to establish models of three collection and remanufacturing modes among channel members involving a manufacturer, a seller, and a remanufacturer. In so doing, the results show that a government's allocations of elementary remanufacturing ratio and the unit amount of reward-penalty count significantly in CLSC operations, especially for the manufacturer, who acts as the leader in the system and makes mode selections.",2018,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

FORUM SELLING ABROAD,; COMPETITION; LITIGATION; GERMANY,"Judges decide cases. Do they also try to influence which cases they decide? Plaintiffs shop for the most attractive forum, but do judges try to attract cases by selling their courts? Some American judges actively try to enlarge their influence by making their courts attractive to plaintiffs, a phenomenon known as forum selling.  This Article shows that forum selling occurs outside the United States as well, focusing on Germany, a country that is often held up as the paragon of the civil law approach to adjudication. As in the United States, German courts attract cases primarily through the pro plaintiff manipulation of procedure, including the routine issuance of ex parte injunctions in press cases and refusal to stay patent infringement proceedings when the patent's validity is challenged in another forum. A critical difference between forum selling in Germany and the United States is that court administrators are more actively involved in Germany. As state officials, German court administrators have the incentive to consider the effect of caseloads on government revenue and the local economy, and they use their power to allocate judges to particular kinds of cases in order to make their courts attractive. They also use their power over promotion, case allocation, and resources to reward judges who succeed in attracting cases. Based on an extensive set of interviews with attorneys, judges, and court officials, this Article describes evidence of forum selling in German patent, press, and antitrust law. It also analyzes how German courts compete internationally with courts of other countries.",2019,Government & Law
Association of Mandatory Disclosure Policies and Laws With Physician-Industry Financial Relationships,; CONFLICTS-OF-INTEREST; PAYMENTS; PATTERNS; GIFTS; US,"IMPORTANCE Beside the goal of increasing transparency to the public, disclosure policies and laws have been established with a goal to also reduce ethically questionable financial relationships between physicians and the medical industry. Data on these relationships should be reviewed to understand the association between these policies and laws and the attainment of reduced relationships. OBJECTIVE To assess whether disclosure policies and laws have been associated with a decrease in financial disclosure reporting by physicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study uses yearly data from 2008 through 2015 from the participants in the American Academy of Ophthalmology's Annual Meeting. Trends in financial disclosures over time were investigated for the association of disclosure policies and laws with potentially beneficial, as well as ethically questionable physician-industry ties. Linear regression models were used to estimate the annual change in financial disclosures and are reported with 95% CIs. EXPOSURES Disclosure policies and laws. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The annual aggregate financial disclosures by type (ie, consultant, lecturer, employee, grant support, equity owner, patent holder). RESULTS Financial disclosures increased from 3966 in 2008 to 5266 in 2015 (P < .001). The number of disclosures reported in the categories consultant, equity owner, patents, and grant support all increased from 2008 to 2015 (consultant disclosures, 121 [95% CI, 88-155] per year; P < .001; equity owner disclosures, 32 [95% CI, 22-42] per year; P < .001; patent disclosures, 19 [95% CI, 13-26] per year; P < .001; grant support disclosures, 78 [95% CI, 48-107] per year; P < .001), while the employee and lecturer categories did not change significantly. The percentage of financial disclosures in the lecturer category decreased relative to the total (estimate, -1.1% [95% CI, -1.3% to -0.8%] per year; P < .001), owing to the number of financial disclosures for this category remaining stable while most other types increased. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Disclosure was not associated with a chilling effect (decrease in financial disclosures associated with potentially beneficial physician-industry ties). Disclosure was associated with a possible disinfecting effect, whereby the percentage of ethically questionable disclosures (ie, lecturers) decreased, although the frequency remained stable. A permissive effect (physicians becoming more inclined to having industry relationships) was also observed. Thus, disclosure rules should be enhanced or alternative approaches to disclosure reconsidered to promote a decrease in ethically questionable relationships.",2019,Ophthalmology
What are the trade-offs of academic entrepreneurship? An investigation on the Italian case,Technology transfer; Policy evaluation; Spin-off; Academic entrepreneurship; Propensity score matching; BAYH-DOLE ACT; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; SPIN-OFFS; UNIVERSITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP; DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION; START; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; PROPENSITY; VENTURES,"This study addresses the following research questions: what happens to the propensity to collaborate with other firms, once the researcher creates her own venture? Do her collaborations decrease or do they grow? These questions have been overlooked by the current literature, even though they carry important policy implications. Our key suggestion is that the effectiveness of a technology transfer tool can be better assessed by taking into account the possible crowding-out effects with other channels of knowledge transfer. We do so for Italy, by comparing the behavior of single researchers, before and after the establishment of their own firm, with the behavior of a control group. We assess whether those academics that founded their own firm significantly change their attitude to perform research collaborations with other firms by means of co-publication and co-patenting. We also verify whether creating a firm has an impact on the overall patenting and publication performance. Our results suggest that there is a negative effect on the overall publishing performance, while the patenting activity does not change significantly. Regarding co-publications, our results confirm the existence of a substitution effect between spin-offs and co-publication with firms, while we observe an increase in the case of co-patenting. A closer look at the data, however, suggests that the latter is mainly triggered by the patenting activity that the researcher performs with his or her own company.",2018,Engineering; Business & Economics
POLITICS OF BIOPIRACY: AN ADVENTURE INTO HOODIA/XHOBA PATENTING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA,Hoodia; Patenting; San; Indigenous peoples; ASB; PIC; GIs; ,"Background: Africa is being described as the wretched of the earth, despite this, the continent is endowed with natural resources, dynamic ecosystem, and different species of plants and animals, and species derivatives. This paper area of departure is to focus on Hoodia, a plant that is being a source of food, medicine and water for the San and Khoe indigenous peoples before the advent of Europeans into southern Africa. South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) dubiously patented Hoodia without observing the basic indices of geographical indications (GIs), indigenous knowledge (IK), novelty, access sharing benefit (ASB), prior informed consent (PIC) and sustainability of ecosystem before the rights was sold to Phytopharm pharmaceutical company. Materials and methods: This article adopts neoliberal thesis with emphasis on complex interdependence theory of organic linkages between developing and developed countries. Secondary sources of information taken into account of qualitative and critical discuss content analyses dominate this paper. Result: The paper recommends a linkage between developed and developing states based on endowment theory and comparative advantage with the notion of adhering to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) which has three objectives: the conservation of biodiversity; the sustainable utilisation of indigenous biological resources (IBR); and fair and equitable benefit sharing. Conclusion: The paper recommends that there is a need to follow CBD and other relevant international regimes that promote equal exchange in exploitation of Africa resources as against the present skewed arrangement that is in favour of multinational corporations (MNCs).",2017,Integrative & Complementary Medicine
LICENSING INVENTIONS FROM ENTREPRENEURIAL UNIVERSITIES: THE CONTEXT OF BAYH-DOLE,Bayh-Dole; Express License; running royalties; sublicense rights; ,"Licensing from US universities is done within the overall legal framework of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 and the employment agreements of universities. This chapter explains common contracts used by universities to license technologies developed by their faculty and students within the context of these laws. In addition to the legal framework, the nature of license agreements is affected by the embryonic nature of most university inventions, which necessitates faculty and student involvement in development, and the entrepreneurial goals of the university. Universities have diverse goals in terms of revenue, licenses executed, inventions commercialized, patents filed, and number of startups formed. The somewhat obvious problem is that the goals of faculty, students, the university, and the licensee may not be aligned. Common contracts used are meant to align these goals. While some contracts include multiple terms such as upfront fees, running royalties, annual payments, and equity, Express Licenses are increasingly being used to accommodate the entrepreneurial environment. This chapter discusses these issues and also the importance of the rights to sublicense inventions.",2016,Business & Economics
AMERICA INVENTS-AND SO CAN YOU? THE DICHOTOMY OF SUBJECT-MATTER ELIGIBILITY CHALLENGES IN POST-GRANT PROCEEDINGS,; ,"In 2011, Congress passed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, a broad-sweeping reform of the American patent system. Within this landmark piece of legislation, Congress created trial-like administrative proceedings as a cost-effective alternative to litigation. Inter partes review allows third parties to go before the Patent and Trademark Office and attempt to invalidate an already issued patent on the limited grounds that it fails to meet either novelty or nonobvious standards. For a brief nine-month period following patent issuance, however, a different administrative proceeding governs: post-grant review. With PGR, third parties can bring invalidity challenges that are unavailable to them at IPR-such as the claim that the invention does not encompass patentable subject matter. This Note aims to understand the effect of limiting administrative subject-matter eligibility challenges to a discrete nine-month window, labeling this phenomenon the IPR PGR dichotomy in the process. It argues that, much like common statutes of limitations, the nine-month barrier incentivizes third parties to bring their subject-matter eligibility claims early. But as a consequence, smaller companies and individual inventors will likely be shut out, with only big businesses able to make use of the advantages PGR presents. As such, the Note advocates for legislative reform that would allow more third parties, including the little guy, to bring subject-matter eligibility challenges before the PTO.",2015,Government & Law
Obsolescence in Urban Energy Infrastructures: The Influence of Scaling Laws on Consumption Forecasting,complex systems; energy infrastructures; scaling laws; obsolescence; forecasting; INNOVATION; GROWTH; ORIGIN,"Cities can be considered complex systems, constantly changing and adapting to new economic, social, and cultural dynamics. They exist in many forms and over a wide range of sizes. In spite of this, researchers have discovered regularities in the form of simple scaling laws that emerge when urban outputs of many types, such as income, patents, or energy consumption, are correlated with population size. This article briefly presents some facts and figures on scaling correlations in urban contexts and how this evidence can determine and influence the obsolescence of energy infrastructures. It finally suggests several strategies which could be used to ameliorate the impacts of this on the assessment of urban consumption forecasting.",2015,Urban Studies

This paper's aim is to examine what happens when a market is innovated or, as we call it, redevised' in situations where public and commercial interests significantly diverge. Market devices can serve an important function in such attempts to innovate markets: they are material and/or social arrangements that are put into place to shape the market in question in certain ways. But can such devices really transform a market from within? To examine this question we trace the history of the Geneva Medicines Patent Pool, a civil society initiative introduced to change pharmaceutical firms' licensing and collaboration practices in the market for HIV/AIDS medicines. Our empirical results indicate that redevising a market in response to market failures can shift the market's frames and contribute to altering its practices, but that this is a pragmatic and often lengthy process that is never fully predictable in advance. By attending to the intended and unintended consequences - or misfires - of redevising a market, our study raises important questions around acting in and on the market, market innovation's' ontological impact, zooming in and zooming out when studying redevising, and attending to the temporality of market innovation.",2018,Business & Economics
"Intellectual Property (IP) and Intellectual Property Right (IPR), Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Protection of Traditional Medical Knowledge (TMK)",Intellectual property (IP); Intellectual property right (IPR); Traditional knowledge(TK); ,"Intellectual property (IP), creations of the mind, has both a moral and a commercial value. Traditional medical knowledge, such as the medicinal use of herbs, is often associated with genetic resources. Herbal genetic resources exist in nature and are not creations of the human mind; therefore, they cannot be directly protected as intellectual property (IP). They are subject to access and benefit-sharing regulations under international agreements. Patents based on traditional Indian medicine have included the use of turmeric for healing wounds; the antifungal properties of neem and a diabetes medicine made from extract of black plum (Syzygium cumini) were subsequently revoked. IP includes inventions, literary and artistic works, designs and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected by patents, copyright, trademarks, trade secret, geographical indication, etc. IP law grants the author of an intellectual creation exclusive right for exploiting and benefiting from their creation. Intellectual property right (IPR) is a right of a person or a company to have exclusive authority over the use of its own plans, ideas, or other intangible assets without the worry of competition. This right safeguards creators and other producers and may be enforced by a court via a lawsuit. The plant variety protection and farmers rights act enacted in many countries of the world was designed to protect the new plant and crop variety. On April 26 every year, we celebrate World Intellectual Property Day to promote discussion of the role of IP in encouraging innovation and creativity. According to Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary, or artistic production of which he is the author. The ethical problems brought up by intellectual property rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life-saving medicines and genetically modified seeds that are given intellectual property protection. Traditional knowledge (TK) about the use of medicinal herbs of many nations is highly valuable. TK of various communities has even led to discovery and development of drugs like digitalis, morphine, colchicine, artemisinin, podophyllotoxin, salicin, etc., from various plant species. Biodiversity rich regions of various continents across the globe harbor flora of immense medicinal importance. The fastest growing international drug market for botanical medicines has seriously affected many species almost to the level of extinction because many of their ruthless exploitation in an unsystematic manner. The traditional knowledge is drawing global attention, popularity, and patronization due to awareness regarding the side effects of allopath but this has made the traditional knowledge system prone to `biopiracy' and `patenting' both within the country of origin as well as outside. The false claim on novelty and use of indigenous knowledge for commercial benefits needs to be checked. It is essential not only to preserve the traditional and indigenous knowledge but also to preserve the biodiversity of a locality and culture of the indigenous people from wrongful ownership. The major International Regulations effecting IPRs and traditional knowledge are Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs). The provisions of TRIPs and CBD have tried to develop a system of protection of traditional knowledge globally, which needs to be further strengthened in terms of providing incentives for disclosure and dissemination of valuable traditional knowledge. The disclosure and dissemination of traditional knowledge is to be achieved by linking the grassroots knowledge systems with the global opportunities for financing the commercial use of biological diversity. The developing countries have a rich abundance of indigenous and local knowledge systems, and documentation of this knowledge is of prime importance. This documentation in electronic format would serve as a databank for searching for information before grant of patent and would register the traditional use patterns.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
CRISES AND TAX,; LIABILITY RULES; PROPERTY RULES; RIGHTS; VIEW; LAW,"How can law best mitigate harm from crises like storms, epidemics, and financial meltdowns? This Article uses the law and economics framework of property rules and liability rules to analyze crisis responses across multiple areas of law, focusing particularly on the ways the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) battled the 2008-09 financial crisis. Remarkably, the IRS's responses to that crisis cost more than Congress's higher-profile bank bailouts. Despite their costs, many of the IRS's responses were underinclusive, causing preventable layoffs and foreclosures. This Article explains these failures and demonstrates that the optimal response to crises is to shift from harsh property rules to compensatory liability rules, temporarily. Arranging such a shift in advance further mitigates harm when crises arrive. This analysis also provides new insights for the broader literature on property rules and liability rules. For example, arranging in advance for temporary moves to liability rules during crises can avoid windfalls, allow speedier relief, and encourage flexible private contracts. These lessons have practical applications in areas as far afield as how constitutional law and patent law respond to epidemics.",2018,Government & Law

In Japan, another aspect must be considered in order to clearly understand this transformation. In addition to fully qualified legal professionals, orbengoshi, there are many different certified law-related practitioners such asshiho shoshi(judicial scriveners),gyosei shoshi(administrative scriveners),zeirishi(certified public tax attorneys),benrishi(patent attorneys),sharoshi(labour and social-security attorneys), and others who are also important actors in the legal- and law-related-services market. These certified law-related practitioners take on important roles not only in services related to civil and administrative law, but also in corporate legal matters in the specialized fields of the business activities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Japan. Traditionally,bengoshiand other certified law-related practitioners have shared the legal-services market symbiotically, without competition. However, the situation has gradually changed since around the 1990s. In this paper, the factors of the transformation of the Japanese legal- and law-related-services market are discussed based on empirical data, and the direction of the transformation in this market is indicated.",2019,Government & Law
Structural changes and trade competitiveness in the Indian pharmaceutical industry in product patent regime,Pharmaceutical industry; Revealed comparative advantage; MNCs; Trade; Merger and acquisition; R&D; Patent; PERFORMANCE,"Purpose This paper aims to present structural changes and trade competitiveness in Indian pharmaceutical industry in pre and post product patent regime. The study shows the impact of product patent on market structure, ownership, trade, revealed comparative advantage, R&D and mergers and acquisitions. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on secondary data and extensive relevant conceptual and empirical literature review. Findings The study finds that this oligopoly Indian dominant pharmaceutical industry has many challenges ahead such as in R&D expenditure, patent expiration of many major drugs manufactured in Ireland, growing competition in generic global market, bulk drugs dependence on China, rise in the number of M&As, rising costs of new drug discovery and tightening safety and efficacy testing requirements. The smaller firms are likely to act as the contract manufacturers for medium and bigger companies at a lower value chain. The Normalised Revealed Comparative Advantage (NRCA) index was calculated for top exporters of pharmaceutical. It was found that NRCA index of IPI has shown deterioration from 1996 to 2005 and thereafter, improvement except in the year 2009. Switzerland, Belgium and Ireland are the top three countries in NRCA index, which are followed by Germany, the UK and France. Originality/value It attempts to capture recent trends in market structure, comparative advantage indices, R&D, trade, M&A and ownership, especially in new IPR regime. There is a dearth of studies providing detailed analyses of India's comparative advantage vis-a-vis other leading exporters of pharmaceutical products in the world. The paper would be of value to practitioners and scholars interested in structural changes of IPI, especially in product patent regime. The findings have significant implications for managers and government for future policymaking.",2019,Health Care Sciences & Services
Comparative Analysis of Major Issues Involved in IPR and Competition Policy,; ,"As IPR and competition laws share the same economic rationale, they both are crucial for the establishment of competitive and innovative market conditions. On the other hand, these two regimes are conflicting to each other, IP grants monopoly, whereas competition laws seek to undo monopolistic and restrictive trade practices. Therefore, focus has been shifted towards how these two separate regimes are complementary and conflicting to each other through their goals, how competition policy is effective on IPRs, and IPRs on competition policy. IPRs granted by patents, copyrights, and trademarks, etc. play an important role in fostering innovation and sustaining economic growth.",2015,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science
Promotion of technological development and determination of or biotechnology trends in five selected Latin American countries: An analysis based on PCT patent applications,Argentina; Biotechnology; Brazil; Chile; Commercialization; Cuba; Development; Latin America; Mexico; Patent cooperation treaty; Patents; PCT; Technology; INNOVATION; RIGHTS,"Background: Science and technology are two desirable elements for the economic and social development of a country. Biotechnology has a particularly important potential for economic development.Nevertheless, patent production in Latin America remains underdeveloped, which creates the need to analyze its trend and the efforts made to promote patent production. Therefore, the purpose of this study was, on the one hand, to determine trends in biotechnology-related PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) applications in Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba from 1999 to 2015, and, on the other hand, to determine whether there is a relationship between the gross domestic expenditure on research and experimental development as a percentage of gross domestic product (GERD/GDP) and PCT applications for biotechnological inventions from 2007 to 2015 (in this case, the period under study was limited from 2007 to 2015, due to data availability for GERD/GDP in the five selected countries). Results: The first part of this study shows that the growth in biotechnology PCT applications has been moderate and gradual and the trend was fitted to a linear model. The second set of results shows that GERD/GDP is associated with biotechnology-related PCT applications issued during the study period with a significance level of alpha=0.01. Conclusions: Even though results indicate a gradual and modest progress, it is necessary that these five representative Latin American nations continue acting toward the protection of intellectual property in the area of biotechnology, especially by configuring strategies for further progress based on investments on research and development.

Long-term incentive theory supports positive effects of 'good' employee treatment on innovation. Alternatively, entrenchment theory suggests such treatment will lead to complacency and shirking, hence deterring innovation. These opposing views merit investigation since human capital is increasingly essential to the growth and success of a firm. Using the KLD database and patent/citation data, we find a significant positive relationship between favorable employee treatment and the innovation quantity and quality of a firm. Furthermore, we find that the positive treatment of employees improves innovation focus - more innovation related to firms' core business, leading to greater firm value via the increased economic value of patents. These findings, robust to endogeneity concerns, provide support for the long-term incentive hypothesis, suggesting that well-treated employees increase firm innovation. Thus, firm innovation represents a channel through which positive employee treatment enhances firm value.",2019,Business & Economics
Music Physicianers: Blues Lyric Form and the Patent Medicine Show,; SOUND,"Patent medicine shows became popular in the United States around the turn of the twentieth century by selling their products alongside free musical and theatrical entertainments. The doctors promised a range of cures, but usually mixed their remedies with alcohol or narcotics using the promise of health to evade religious authorities and law enforcement, even in diy counties. Many talented black performers toured with medicine shows, including a number of artists later associated with the blues, I argue that the medicine show had a decisive impact on die blues by providing not simply training in performance, but also an impetus for the notorious suggestiveness of its lyric code. The blues borrows from the medicine show its lawless appeal to ailments uncategorized and ignored by socially sanctioned experts.",2016,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics
HOW COURTS ADJUDICATE PATENT DEFINITENESS AND DISCLOSURE,; REALITIES; SELECTION,"Section 112 of the Patent Act requires patentees to clearly explain what their invention is (a requirement known as claim definiteness), as well as how to make and use it (the disclosure requirements of enablement and written description). Many concerns about the modern patent system stem from these requirements. But despite the critical importance of 112 to the functioning of the patent system, there is surprisingly little empirical data about how it has been applied in practice. To remedy the reliance on anecdotes, we have created a hand-coded dataset of 1144 reported court decisions from 1982 to 2012 in which U.S. district courts or the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rendered a decision on the enablement, written-description, or claim-definiteness requirements of 112. We coded validity outcomes under these three doctrines on a novel five-level scale so as to capture significant subtlety in the strength of each decision, and we also classified patents by technology and industry categories. We also coded for a number of litigation characteristics that could arguably influence outcomes. Although one must be cautious about generalizing from reported decisions due to selection effects, our results show some statistically significant disparities in 112 outcomes for different technologies and industries-although fewer than the conventional wisdom suggests, and not always in the direction that many have believed. Just as importantly, our analysis reveals significant relationships between other variables and 112 litigation outcomes, including whether a district court or the Federal Circuit made the last decision in a case, whether a patent claim was drafted in means-plus-function format, and whether a case was decided before or after Markman v. Westview Instruments. Our results showing how 112 has been applied in practice will be helpful in evaluating current proposals for reform, and our rich dataset will enable more systematic studies of these critical doctrines in the future.",2016,Government & Law
Augmenting Data Quality through High-Precision Gender Categorization,Data quality improvement; record completion; gender name mapping; patenting; ,"Mappings of first name to gender have been widely recognized as a critical tool for the completion, study, and validation of data records in a range of areas. In this study, we investigate how organizations with large databases of existing entities can create their own mappings between first names and gender and how these mappings can be improved and utilized. Therefore, we first explore a dataset with demographic information on more than 4 million people, which was provided by a car insurance company. Then, we study how naming conventions have changed over time and how they differ by nationality. Next, we build a probabilistic first-name-to-gender mapping and augment the mapping by adding nationality and decade of birth to improve the mapping's performance. We test our mapping in two-label and three-label settings and further validate our mapping by categorizing patent filings by gender of the inventor. We compare the results with previous studies' outcomes and find that our mapping produces high-precision results. We validate that the additional information of nationality and year of birth improve the precision scores of name-to-gender mappings. Therefore, the proposed approach constitutes an efficient process for improving the data quality of organizations' records, if the gender attribute is missing or unreliable.",2019,Computer Science
Counteracting SEP Abuse: In Search of a WTO-Consistent Approach,; ,"This article assesses risks of WTO inconsistencies of 'stringent' and 'relaxed' competition regimes that counteract standard essential patent (SEP) abuse with the provisions of the WTO TRIPS and TBT Agreements and provides recommendations on how such risks should be mitigated. First, China has pioneered introducing quite 'stringent' lex specialis to counteract SEP abuse. Such shifting of the balance between patent holder's rights and obligations may breach TRIPS Article 28 not justified under TRIPS Articles 30, 31 or 40.2. Second, the EU and US are examples of a more 'relaxed' competition regime that employs general provisions of competition law elaborated in a body of case-law to counteract SEP abuse. It is assessed whether SEP abuse that deters technological innovation or negatively impacts cross-border trade may contravene TRIPS Articles 7, 8.2 and 40.3. Another red zone for WTO compliance emerges when SEPs are part of an international standard within the meaning of TBT Annex 1.2 and SEP abuse creates unnecessary obstacles to international trade in violation of TBT Article 4.1. This article advocates for balancing of SEP holder's rights and obligations in a WTO-consistent manner.",2019,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
The use of generic medications for hepatitis C,direct-acting antiviral; generic; hepatitis C; REDEMPTION-1; ,"Hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV, TB and malaria are the five major causes of infectious disease death worldwide. In a breakthrough that rivals the invention of penicillin, drugs that cure hepatitis C, with minimal side effects and high success rates, have reached the market, but, in what must be one of the greatest tragedies of modern times, these life-saving medications are not being deployed on a mass scale. Pharmaceutical patents are gifted to private corporations by governments for the dual purposes of protecting R&D expenditure and encouraging innovation. Unfortunately the monopoly pricing power these patents provision currently lacks adequate checks and balances, is open to abuse, and is quite clearly being abused. The sort of legislative changes required to deliver on the original goals of pharmaceutical patents will take years or even decades to eventuate. Parallel importation of generic medication offers hope to the millions of patients with HCV unable to afford access to vastly overpriced originator medications. Doctors prescribing and monitoring patients taking generics can take comfort from the fact that the REDEMPTION trial results show, like the HIV generics that came before them, that HCV generics deliver robust clinical results.",2016,Gastroenterology & Hepatology

While mandatory regulation remains the central tenet of US environmental policy, the regulatory landscape has changed since the early 1990s with the increased recourse by federal and state agencies to corporate environmentalism voluntary pollution prevention (P2) by firms to achieve environmental improvements. We therefore estimate the effects of voluntary P2 activities on the patenting of environmental technologies by a sample of manufacturing firms. With our panel data of 352 firms over the 1991-2000 period, we adopt an instrumental variable Poisson framework to account for the count nature of patents and the endogeneity of the P2 adoption decision. Our results indicate that the adoption of voluntary P2 activities in the manufacturing sector has led to a statistically and economically significant increase in the number of environmental patents, suggesting that corporate environmentalism can act as a catalyst for investments in cleaner technologies. Our findings are internationally relevant given the increasing ubiquity of corporate environmentalism in both developed and developing economies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Controlling CRISPR Through Law: Legal Regimes as Precautionary Principles,; ETHICS; EXTINCTION,"Since its advent in 2012, CRISPR has spawned a cottage industry of bioethics literature. One principal criticism of the technology is its virtually instant widespread adoption prior to deliberative bodies conducting a meaningful ethical review of its harms and benefits-a violation, to some, of bioethics' precautionary principle. This view poorly considers, however, the role that the law can play-and does, in fact, play-in policing the introduction of ethically problematic uses of the technology. This Perspective recounts these legal regimes, including regulatory agencies and premarket approval, tort law and deterrence, patents and ethical licenses, funding agencies and review boards, as well as local politics. Identifying these legal regimes and connecting them to the precautionary principle should be instructive for bioethicists and policy makers who wish to conduct ethical reviews of new applications of CRISPR prior to their introduction.",2019,Genetics & Heredity
Entrepreneurship and Legal Uncertainty: Unexpected Federal Trademark Registrations for Marijuana Derivatives,; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; LAW; STRATEGY,"Though several states have legalized marijuana use, the drug remains illegal under federal law. Not surprisingly, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) refuses to register trademarks related to marijuana because of the federal prohibition. What is surprising, though, is the willingness to grant trademarks for cannabidiol (CBD), a marijuana derivative that is likewise expressly illegal under federal drug laws. This article explains why the USPTO's divergent treatment of trademark applications for CBD and marijuana products is legally incoherent. Additionally, when viewed from an entrepreneurial perspective, this phenomenon exemplifies how legal uncertainty breeds entrepreneurial opportunity. Specifically, the article argues that the evolving regulatory landscape for CBD and marijuana products has been and continues to be ripe for legal strategists and innovative entrepreneurs to combine forces to create competitive advantage in the emerging marijuana industry.",2018,Business & Economics; Government & Law

This patent-pending material has a high hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-removal capacity while allowing for low-H2S breakthrough at the exit gas. CNF were produced by a patented ethanol dry reforming process, then acid-treated prior to Fe functionalization through a wet impregnation-calcination protocol. Desulfurization tests were performed with 35- to 95-mg samples and gas flow of 500 ppm H2S in helium. To understand the desulfurization process, fresh and used Fe-CNF were analyzed thoroughly by X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that carbon (C) has 2 important roles in this Fe-CNF sorbent: it acts both as sulfur adsorbent and nanometric support which disperses Fe efficiently in oxide form, enhancing the H2S capture rate and efficiency. As well, iron oxide has 2 roles in the sorbent: at low T (100 degrees C), it acts as adsorption catalyst for H2S-dissociative oxidation, and at higher T (300 degrees C), it reacts with H2S to form iron sulfide. At the higher T tested, sulfidation occurred in parallel with C adsorption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015,Chemistry; Materials Science
Anticoagulation in patients with Embolic Stroke of Unknown Source,Anticoagulant; antiplatelet; cardio-aortic embolism; cardioembolic; embolic stroke of unknown source; patent foramen ovale; percutaneous closure; stroke subtypes; APIXABAN; ASPIRIN,"When warfarin was the mainstay of anticoagulation for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke, the paradigm was essentially we mustn't anticoagulate anyone unless we prove that the stroke was cardioembolic. Now that direct-acting oral anticoagulants are available, the paradigm should change. The risk of stroke is highest soon after the initial event, particularly in patients with more than one infarction. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are not significantly more likely than aspirin to cause severe hemorrhage, and it is now clear that patients with paradoxical embolism are better treated with anticoagulant than aspirin. Percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale is better than aspirin, but not better than anticoagulant, and some patients with paradoxical embolism may be better treated with anticoagulant than with percutaneous closure, which cannot prevent pulmonary embolism. Patients in whom cardioembolic stroke is strongly suspected should probably be anticoagulated pending the results of investigations such as echocardiography and prolonged cardiac monitoring for atrial fibrillation, and some of them, in whom the suspicion of a cardioembolic source is very strong, should probably be anticoagulated long term, even if such investigations do not confirm a cardiac source.",2019,Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Collaboration or funding: lessons from a study of nanotechnology patenting in Canada and the United States,Research funding; Academic patents; Collaboration; Nanotechnology; BAYH-DOLE ACT; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; NETWORK STRUCTURE; IMPACT; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; UNIVERSITY; ENTREPRENEURIAL; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY,This paper is concerned with how government research funding and collaboration between researchers affect academic technological production in the context of nanotechnology in Canada and in the United States. We use the co-invention and co-authorship networks of scientists to build indicators of collaborative behaviour and investigate whether the nature of the network plays a role in the academic technological productivity and quality. Results suggest that technological output has the potential to offer governments useful guidance concerning the effectiveness of academic grants and collaboration in the United States and in Canada. This paper provides evidence that the position of researchers in both co-invention and co-publication networks does influence technological productivity and quality.,2019,Engineering; Business & Economics
First report of a naturally patent infection with Dirofilaria immitis in an otter (Lutra lutra),Eurasian otter; Lutra lutra; Parasite; Dirofilaria immitis; Heartworm; Natural infection; SERBIA,"Dirofilaria immitis causes a severe and life-threatening cardio-pulmonary disease in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas; also, zoonotic infections have been reported. This parasitic vector-borne disease is mostly common in domestic and wild canids and felids. Here, we present a rare finding of this roundworm in the heart of a Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra). Four mature specimens of D. immitis were found in the right ventricle of the heart. Necropsy was performed after the animal was found road-killed in Eastern Serbia, close to the Danube River. Two heartworms were females, one was male and sex for one remained unidentified. Microfilariae were present in the uterus of one of the female heartworms, indicating that otters can act as reservoirs of dirofilariasis in the wild. This is the first report of a patent infection in a free-ranging otter.",2018,Parasitology
Property and the cloud,Cloud computing; Property; Intellectual property; Copyright; Trade secret; Patents; Contractual terms; Dispute resolution; Data protection; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; SOFTWARE PATENTS; BIG DATA; LEGAL; FUTURE; ISSUES; FIRM,"Data is a modem form of wealth in the digital world, and massive amounts of data circulate in cloud environments. While this enormously facilitates the sharing of information, both for personal and professional purposes, it also introduces some critical problems concerning the ownership of the information. Data is an intangible good that is stored in large data warehouses, where the hardware architectures and software programs running the cloud services coexist with the data of many users. This context calls for a twofold protection: on one side, the cloud is made up of hardware and software that constitute the business assets of the service provider (property of the cloud); on the other side, there is a definite need to ensure that users retain control over their data (property in the cloud). The law grants protection to both sides under several perspectives, but the result is a complex mix of interwoven regimes, further complicated by the intrinsically international nature of cloud computing that clashes with the typical diversity of national laws. As the business model based on cloud computing grows, public bodies, and in particular the European Union, are striving to find solutions to properly regulate the future economy, either by introducing new laws, or by finding the best ways to apply existing principles.

Return migration and geography of innovation in MNEs: a natural experiment of knowledge production by local workers reporting to return migrants,Return migration; knowledge production; multinational enterprise; internal labor markets; BRAIN-DRAIN; ECONOMICS; SPILLOVERS; DIFFUSION; PROXIMITY; MOBILITY; FLOWS; FIRM,"I study whether return migrants facilitate knowledge production by local employees working for them at geographically distant research and development (R&D) locations. Using unique personnel and patenting data for 1315 employees at the Indian R&D center of a Fortune 500 technology firm, I exploit a natural experiment where the assignment of managers for newly hired college graduates is mandated by rigid HR rules and is uncorrelated to observable characteristics of the graduates. Given this assignment protocol, I find that local employees with returnee managers file disproportionately more US patents. I also find some evidence that return migrants act as a 'bridge' to transfer knowledge from the MNE headquarters to the local employees working for them.",2016,Business & Economics; Geography
Economic efficiency and field-of-use pricing of SEP licences under FRAND terms,patent system; patent markets; field-of-use licensing; price differentiation; SEP; FRAND; digital economy; economic development; DISCRIMINATION; AUCTION; SYSTEMS,"This article is concerned with the producer market in patented technology, and whether price differentiation based on field-of-use - a common strategy adopted by businesses with high fixed costs - is economically efficient. The focus is on the licensing of Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) on Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions, including also the Internet of Things (MT) applications, and the economic growth in the digital economy, especially for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The central argument proposed is that the absolute difference in the value between usages of essential standardized technologies determines whether a single price for all usages or specific field-of-use prices are economically efficient A small difference in value should result in a single price and a large difference in different prices. Pricing policy is critical to create a world-wide sustained technology development including contributions from, and applications for, emerging markets and developed markets, thereby growing the digital economy. In this literature review, three evaluation angles of the literature are used: a market analysis under neo-classical assumptions of price-taking agents and marginal (incremental) value; an expanded market analysis where the willingness to pay (WTP) replaces marginal cost as criteria for what price should be paid for licences; and an analysis of market designs with similar characteristics as the SEP market in terms of risk, using experimental economics (behavioural) and auction theory. All analyses angles investigate the principle of field-of-use licensing, established already in the first known patent law in 1474.",2019,Government & Law
Printing spare parts through additive manufacturing: legal and digital business challenges,Additive manufacturing; Strategic management; Service operations; Spare parts; Patent law; Digital businesses; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; CRITICALITY,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the technology, business and intellectual property issues surrounding the production of spare parts through additive manufacturing (AM) from a digital source. It aims to identify challenges to the growth of the AM spares market and propose suitable solutions. Design/methodology/approach The paper begins with a systematic literature review and theoretical analysis. This is followed by case study research through semi-structured interviews, forming the basis of a triangulated, cross-case analysis of empirical data. Findings The paper identifies several obstacles to the development of the AM-produced digital spares market. The manufacturing industry will soon be forced to re-think AM as a real manufacturing alternative. Short-term, AM technology has implications for the production of components for legacy systems for which tooling facilities no longer exist. Long-term, AM will be used to produce a wide range of components especially when product and/or service functionality can be increased. To enable companies to navigate current uncertainties in the patent framework (especially the repair vs make doctrine), new intellectual property rights strategies could be developed around patenting both complex devices and their individual components, and seeking patent protection for CAD files. Further harmonization of the EU legal framework, the interpretation of claims and the scope of protection offered in the context of spare parts, will also be important. Originality/value This study pinpoints key issues that need to be addressed within the European AM business environment and the patent system and proposes recommendations for business and legal frameworks to promote the growth of a stable European digital spare parts market.",2018,Engineering; Business & Economics
NOTICE FAILURE AND DEFENSES IN TRADEMARK LAW,; CONFUSION,"Notice is important in intellectual property law, but notice works differently in trademark law than in copyright and patent. Trademark law is not based on a property theory and the rights it creates are not property rights in the usual sense. As a result, the costs of notice failure are not necessarily as high in trademark as in patent and copyright, and solutions to notice problems take a somewhat dfferent form. This Article examines notice problems in trademark law, identifies their source, evaluates their costs, and explores ways to remedy them. The principal notice deficiency has to do with uncertainty in determining the scope of trademark rights (rather than the existence or boundaries of protected subject matter), and the main source of the problem is the vague likelihood-of-confusion test for liability, which produces high litigation costs and risks. These costs and risks can chill the descriptive and expressive use of marks, the use of marks in resale markets, and the use of trade dress to compete in product markets. The seriousness of these chilling effects, however, depends on the user and the type of use. After linking notice failure to chilling effects, the Article then explores possible ways to reduce the chilling effect problem. In this regard, an important distinction must be drawn between uses that implicate rights and uses that are valued only for efficiency reasons. Categorical exclusions work well for the former but not very well for the latter (except perhaps for product design trade dress). For cases involving non-expressive descriptive and nominative uses and resale uses, trademark owners should be required to plead (and prove) sufficient facts to support the existence of actual source or sponsorship confusion (not just a likelihood) and a significant risk of serious trademark-related harm, and judges should review preliminary injunction motions strictly. These reforms should go far toward reducing chilling effects while still allowing trademark relief in those exceptional cases involving serious confusion -related harm.",2016,Government & Law
PROTECTION OF VIDEO GAME MECHANICS THROUGH THE PATENTABILITY OF SOFTWARE,Video games; mechanics; patents; copyright; technical problem; idea-expression; computer-implemented inventions; ,"Video games have grown to become one of the most important industries in the world. They combine a wide range of creative, industrial and technological elements, so we can define video games as complex works that can embody multiple intellectual creations. Nevertheless, many professional have assumed that the copyright system is the only one that applies in the case of the legal protection of the systems through which the players interact with a game, referred to as video game mechanics. This position leaves aside other options that could offer their own benefits and even circumvent existing legal loopholes. This paper explores the possibility of the use of the patent law system, with its own limitations, in order to protect those video game mechanics.",2019,Government & Law
Treatment advocate tactics to expand access to antiviral therapy for HIV and viral hepatitis C in low- to high-income settings: making sure no one is left behind,human immunodeficiency virus; hepatitis C virus; co-infection; access; patent; low- and middle-income countries; direct-acting antivirals; people who inject drugs; INJECTING DRUG-USERS; ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT; INFECTED INDIVIDUALS; VIRUS-INFECTION; BARRIERS; PEOPLE; IMPACT; PATENT,"Introduction: Worldwide, 71 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which, without treatment, can lead to liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV co-infection increases liver- and AIDS-related morbidity and mortality among HIV-positive people, despite ART. A 12-week course of HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) usually cures HCV - regardless of HIV status. However, patents and high prices have created access barriers for people living with HCV, especially people who inject drugs (PWID). Inadequate access to and coverage of harm reduction interventions feed the co-epidemics of HIV and HCV; as a result, the highest prevalence of HCV is found among PWID, who face additional obstacles to treatment (including stigma, discrimination and other structural barriers). The HIV epidemic occurred during globalization of intellectual property rights, and highlighted the relationship between patents and the high prices that prevent access to medicines. Indian generic manufacturers produced affordable generic HIV treatment, enabling global scale-up. Unlike HIV, donors have yet to step forward to fund HCV programmes, although DAAs can be mass-produced at a low and sustainable cost. Unfortunately, although voluntary licensing agreements between originators and generic manufacturers enable low-income (and some lower-middle income countries) to buy generic versions of HIV and HCV medicines, most middle-income countries with large burdens of HCV infection and HIV/HCV co-infection are excluded from these agreements. Our commentary presents tactics from the HIV experience that treatment advocates can use to expand access to DAAs. Discussion: A number of practical actions can help increase access to DAAs, including new research and development (R&D) paradigms; compassionate use, named-patient and early access programmes; use of TRIPS flexibilities such as compulsory licences and patent oppositions; and parallel importation via buyers' clubs. Together, these approaches can increase access to antiviral therapy for people living with HIV and viral hepatitis in low-, middle-and high-income settings. Conclusions: The HIV example provides helpful parallels for addressing challenges to expanding access to HCV DAAs. HCV treatment access - and harm reduction - should be massively scaled-up to meet the needs of PWID, and efforts should be made to tackle stigma and discrimination, and stop criminalization of drug use and possession.",2018,Immunology; Infectious Diseases
Deference Asymmetries: Distortions in the Evolution of Regulatory Law,; STATUTORY INTERPRETATION; ADMINISTRATIVE-LAW; AGENCY INACTION; POLICY; RULEMAKING; RULES; CAPTURE; DOCTRINE; CHEVRON; REALITY,"Deference asymmetries are unevaluated phenomena in administrative law. These asymmetries occur when an administrative agency's decision that overly favors its regulated entities is either less likely to be subjected to judicial reexamination, or if it is subjected to judicial challenge, will be afforded a more deferential standard of review than a decision that overly disfavors its regulated entities. Because decisions that are afforded a more deferential standard are more likely to be upheld, deference asymmetries could potentially function as a one-way ratchet, pushing the development of regulatory law in the proregulated-entity direction. In addition to providing a theoretical basis for the bias development of regulatory law that may arise from deference asymmetries, this Article identifies the formal and informal structures in the administrative state that give rise to the skewed application of deference regimes. In doing so, this Article demonstrates that deference asymmetries are not isolated to a few areas of regulation. Rather, a surprising number of agencies that regulate fields ranging from the environment, to patent law, to disability benefits face asymmetric deference with respect to their decision making. Finally, this Article explores the implications of these asymmetries for administrative law.",2015,Government & Law
An Algorithmic Links with Probabilities' Concordance for Trademarks with an Application Towards Bilateral IP Flows,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INNOVATION; PATENTS; MARKS; LAW,"Trademarks (TMs) shape the competitive landscape of markets for goods and services in all countries. As a key element of branding, they can inform consumers about the quality and content of goods and services. Yet, researchers are largely unable to conduct rigorous empirical analysis of TMs in the global economy because TM data and economic data are organised differently and cannot be analysed jointly at the industry or sector level. We propose an algorithmic links with probabilities' (ALP) approach to match TM data to economic data and enable joint analysis with these data. Specifically, we construct a NICE class-level concordance that maps TM data into trade and industry categories forward and backward. This concordance allows researchers to analyse differences in TM usage across both economic and TM sectors. We apply this ALP concordance for TMs to characterise patterns in TM registrations across countries and industries and to investigate some key determinants of international technology flows by comparing bilateral TM registrations and bilateral patent grants. We find that international patenting and TM flows are jointly determined by trade-related influences with significant differences in intellectual property usage across industry sectors and income levels.",2017,Business & Economics; International Relations
Structural preconditions for the rise of the rule of law in China,China; rule of law; governance; rationalized enforcement; accountability; intellectual property rights; environmental protection; DEMOCRACY,"This essay advocates for adopting a disaggregated approach when evaluating the progress that non-democratic countries like China are making towards establishing the rule of law. An understanding that the rule of law may develop in some areas, though not in others, allows us to identify the structural underpinnings of a limited rule-of-law system. The essay adopts a procedural definition of the rule of law as rules-based governance and argues that the regularized enforcement of laws and regulations is the key precondition for its emergence. This study defines regularized enforcement as consistent, transparent, and procedurally fair enforcement and identifies the conditions under which such enforcement may emerge. Although bureaucracies with clear mandates can provide this type of enforcement, it is more likely to develop when courts of law arise as the main enforcers of laws and regulations. The theoretical argument about the issue-specific rule of law in China is illustrated through three case studies. The first is of government accountability, where progress towards the rule of law has been minimal. The second is of intellectual property rights, where regularized enforcement has unexpectedly developed, especially for patents and copyrights. The third area is environmental protection, which is explicitly following the model of intellectual property rights. The essay concludes by arguing that an issue-specific approach allows us to grasp more fully the variation in good governance and progress towards establishing the rule of law that exists on the ground in China.",2016,Government & Law; Public Administration
Property and human genetic information,Genetic information; Patent law; Property; Property rights; Donors; CONSENT; ISSUES,"Do donors (of samples from which genetic information is derived) have some sort of pre-legal (moral) or legal property right to that information? In this paper, we address this question from both a moral philosophical and a legal point of view. We argue that philosophical theories about property do not seem to support a positive answer: We have not mixed our labour with our genes, and the human genome cannot be said to be a fitting object for private ownership based on some idea of self-ownership. An analysis of the term property' as seen from a legal perspective yields the conclusion that property is, at best, a linguistic prop whose real content has to be defined at least partially conventionally. Relevant interests that may be seen to be protected seem to be interests of privacy or interests against exploitation. To the extent that the logic behind the patent system holds true limiting incentives decreases innovation in society. A balancing of interest must take place, and we have to make sure that patent protection serves general societal interests and not just those of special interest groups be that inventors or donors.",2019,Genetics & Heredity
FASHION'S FUNCTION IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW,; ECONOMICS,"Clothing designs can be beautiful. But they are also functional. Fashion's dual nature sits uneasily in intellectual property law, and its treatment by copyright, trademark, and design patent laws has often been perplexing. Much of this difficulty arises from an unclear understanding of the nature of functionality in fashion design. This Article proposes a robust account of fashion's function. It argues that aspects of garment designs are functional not only when they affect the physical or technological performance of a garment but also when they affect the perception of the wearer's body. Generally, clothes are not designed or chosen simply to look good. They are also characteristically designed or chosen to look good on. This approach clarifies the appropriate treatment of fashion design in intellectual property, and it exposes the conceptual limitations of the Supreme Court's recent copyright decision in Star Athletica, L.L.C. v.

These shifts have profound implications for how we must think about law and innovation. Patents, copyrights, noncompete agreements, and trade secret laws are all optimized for an increasingly obsolete worldview. Strong intellectual property impedes, rather than facilitates, innovation when we understand that knowledge flows in learning networks, mixing of market and nonmarket models and motivations, and weaving of commons with property are central to the innovation process.",2017,Government & Law; Sociology

This paper examines whether these reforms also affect incentives to develop new technologies. We develop a theoretical model that predicts that the impact of reducing liability risks for physicians on innovation may be positive or negative, depending on the characteristics of the technology. Empirically, we find that, on average, laws that limit the liability exposure of health care providers are associated with a significant reduction in medical device patenting. Tort reforms have the strongest impact in medical fields in which the probability of facing a malpractice claim is the largest, and they do not seem to affect the number of new technologies of the highest and lowest quality. Our results underscore the importance of considering dynamic effects in the economic analysis of tort laws.",2017,Business & Economics; Government & Law
Reconfigurability of engines: A kinematic approach to variable compression ratio engines,Engine; Variable compression ratio; Mechanism; Kinematic chain; Reconfigurability; ,"The variable compression ratio (VCR) engine has become an opportunity to overcome the new consumption and emissions laws. Researchers believe that the VCR engine can unite both efficiency and performance. Thus, it is applied a methodology based on Tsai (2000) and Yan (1998) in order to investigate the opportunities for the development of VCR engines. A patent survey was conducted analyzing 1163 patents and resulting in 127 different VCR engine designs. Based on that survey and comparing with several authors, this paper proposes an enhanced classification of the VCR engines. The kinematic chains from all classes of VCR engines are analyzed in order to investigate the topological and structural characteristics which are compared with previous works from Freudenstein and Maki (1983) and Tsai (2000). This information is used to discuss both the reconfigurability and the potential for innovation of VCR engines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016,Engineering

First, it examines decolonial vernacular, which contests Western commodification of yoga through the use and misuse of terms and phrases, such as yoga piracy and cultural patents, derived from intellectual property rights, international human rights, and cultural property regimes. Second, it considers dewesternizing restructuring emerging from the creation of the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library, a database of information on yogic practice and medicine, which uses non-Western classification systems to interrupt the legal and economic structures through which patents and copyrights are enunciated.

This paper proposes that a branding strategy approach may help to identify innovation related trademarks. Companies use distinctive branding strategies for innovation and these branding strategies have important consequences for the design of new trademarks and their application scope. Based on a sample of Benelux and Community trademarks, we find that trademarks for brand creation relate more often to product innovation. In addition, we find negative effects of a trademark's industry scope on its relatedness to product innovation, and of a trademark's geographic scope on its relatedness to service innovation.

Areas covered: The patent application describes a set of compounds based on the neurotransmitter acetylcholine applying the Schulman-model for M ligands comprising heterocyclic (often quaternary) amines and a benzene ring (often as benzoic acid esters) to act as bitopic ligands. The compounds claimed hold functional selectivity and are supposed to be therapeutically applied as neuromuscular blocking agents, in asthma as well as CNS diseases. In vitro evaluations of selected compounds supported bitopic binding and some degree of functional selectivity was observed - albeit no selectivity was observed in binding studies. Expert opinion: The quaternary amine structure of the compounds claimed will prohibit penetration into the CNS and their ester structure will lead to significant metabolic instability which will hamper therapeutic applications for many indications. Furthermore, high affinity and subtype selectivity with regard to binding affinity which is observed for bitopic and allosteric ligands in the current literature is not observed for the compounds described in the patent.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

In examining this split, this Article articulates the enablement inquiry in conceptual terms, identifying two elements of the courts' analyses that are implicit in every enablement determination: the nature of enablement disputes as challenges and the articulation of a target or targets that must be enabled. With this understanding in mind, the full scope and any mode language are easily reconciled: For any given target, one mode suffices. But each and every target must be enabled.",2016,Government & Law

THE CASE AGAINST FEDERALIZING TRADE SECRECY,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COMMON-LAW; COVENANTS; FOUNDATIONS; RULES,"TRADE secrecy is unique among the major intellectual property (IP') doctrines because it is governed primarily by state law. Recently, however, a number of influential actors including legislators, academics, high-technology firms, and organizations representing IF attorneys and owners have supported the creation of a private civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation under federal law. Proponents assert that federalizing trade secrecy would provide numerous benefits, including substantive uniformity, the availability of a federal forum for misappropriation litigation, and the creation of a unified national regime for IF rights. This Article engages in the first systematic critique of the claim that federalizing trade secrecy is normatively desirable. Ultimately, it concludes that there are multiple reasons for trade secrecy to remain primarily the province of state law, including preservation of the states' ability to engage in limited experimentation regarding the scope of trade secret protection and federalization's potential negative impact on the disclosure of patent-eligible inventions. Finally, it proposes an alternative approach a modest expansion of federal courts' jurisdiction over state law trade secret claims that can help address the issue of trade secret theft without requiring outright federalization.",2015,Government & Law

In Search for a Legal Framework for Synthetic Biology,; ,"The law answers to new technologies in three different ways: the technologies are enabled and restricted by regulation, they are promoted by (among others) granting intellectual property rights, and they may be required to share benefits. All of these functions come into play in synthetic biology. They are discussed in the present contribution. Concerning the enabling and regulating function the study suggests that the existing regulatory framework for genetically modified organisms (GMOS) cannot be relied on as an adequate means of controlling risks from synthetic biology. Various strands of synthetic biology are either not captured by the present regulation, or not appropriately treated by the present risk assessment methodology. This study suggests that based on a screening and categorisation of the risks from synthetic biology new regulation should be introduced covering both genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Concerning the promotion of the technology through intellectual property law the article finds that patent law has primarily served interests of industry to privatise nature. This has hindered the pluralistic evolution of research and development (R&D). Besides advocating common pool solutions, the article explains how the preconditions of patenting can be interpreted in a way that sparks free R&D in synthetic biology. Concerning benefit sharing the new legal regime on access and benefit sharing is applicable also to synthetic biology. The increasing artificiality of its products however poses the question how the contribution of the original genetic resource can be tracked and valued. It is suggested that rather than relying on the bilateral exchange 'genetic resource for remuneration' joint R&D projects between provider and user should be strived for.",2016,Engineering; Medical Ethics

THE TIPPING POINT - REEVALUATING THE ASNEF-EQUIFAX SEPARATION OF COMPETITION OF DATA PRIVACY LAW IN THE WAKE OF THE 2017 EQUIFAX DATA BREACH,; DATA PROTECTION,"Contrary to the Court of Justice for the European Union's decision in the Asnef-Equifax case, in a world of big data, it is inefficient and ineffective to treat EU competition law and EU data protection law as entirely separate legal considerations. Reevaluating this stance is critical in sectors where customer data is highly sensitive, and therefore highly valuable to those who steal it, particularly for the financial and healthcare sectors. Looking forward, companies that store and use biometric data will have to be similarly scrutinized. To correct this problem, the EU has numerous paths it can take: (a) continue as is, treating competition and data protection as separate legal considerations, (b) enact a new body of regulatory law to specifically deal with data protection and competition, or (c) begin using existing competition law, specifically Article 101 of the TFEU, to address data protection concerns.

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc.,; ,"In this decision, as discussed in more detail in the current Holman Report, the Supreme Court interprets two provisions of 42 U. S. C. 262(l), which governs the statutory scheme for preparing to adjudicate, and then adjudicating, claims of infringement brought by the sponsor of an approved biologic against a biosimilar applicant under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), often referred to as the BPCIA's patent dance.'' The first provision requires that the applicant shall provide'' the sponsor with a copy of the application and information about how the biosimilar is manufactured within 20 days after FDA accepts the application for review. The Court held that when a biosimilar applicant fails to provide this information to the sponsor, the sponsor's only remedy under federal law is an action for a declaratory judgment of infringement; the requirement is not enforceable by an injunction. The Court remanded to the Federal Circuit to determine whether applicant's failure to provide the information might be enforceable by an injunction under California state law. The second provision at issue states that the applicant must give notice to the sponsor at least 180 days before commencing to market the biosimilar commercially. In the decision below, the Federal Circuit had held that the 180 days' notice could only be given after the biosimilar had received FDA approval. The Court reversed on this point, holding that the applicant may provide notice either before or after receiving FDA approval. Thus, it is possible under some circumstances for an applicant to begin marketing its biosimilar earlier than 180 days after approval.",2017,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

First report of a naturally patent infection of Angiostrongylus costaricensis in a dog,Abdominal angiostrongyliasis; Angiostrongylidae; Pet; Zoonotic helminth; Reservoir; Molecular analyses; REDESCRIPTION; CESPEDES; MORERA; LARVAE,"Angiostrongylus costaricensis is the zoonotic agent of abdominal angiostrongyliasis in several countries in North and South America. Rodents are recognized as the main definitive hosts of A. costaricensis, but other wildlife species can develop patent infections. Although, several human cases have been described in the literature, the role of domestic animals in the epidemiology of the infection is not clear. Here we review the literature available on A. costaricensis in mammals and describe the first confirmed fatal case of abdominal angiostrongyliasis in a 4-month-old dog, presented with intestinal perforation, peritonitis and faecal shedding of first-stage larvae. Parasite identity was confirmed by morphology, histology and molecular characterization of target genes. This is the first record of a naturally infected dog acting as a definitive host for A. costaricensis. These data suggest that dogs may potentially spread this parasite in urbanized areas.

Distant recombination and the creation of basic inventions: An analysis of the diffusion of public and private sector nanotechnology patents in Canada,Academic enterprise; Markets for technology; Search heuristics; Capabilities; Knowledge diffusion; BAYH-DOLE ACT; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER ORGANIZATIONS; COGNITIVE DISTANCE; UNIVERSITY; KNOWLEDGE; INDUSTRY; INNOVATION; SCIENCE; FIRMS; EXPLORATION,"This article explores whether the relationship between the breath of technological integration (recombination distance) and the breath of an invention's subsequent application (basicness) is moderated by the sector of activity (private or public), science-linkage strength and industry characteristics. Our analysis of Canadian nanotechnology patents granted between 1990 and 1997 shows that although private organizations generally yield smaller rates of basic inventions than public organizations, increases to recombination distance by the former increases invention basicness at a higher rate; increasing reliance upon basic science moderates the relationship between recombination distance and basicness; and increases to recombination distance in emerging science-based industries increases invention basicness at a higher rate. These findings have implications regarding the debate around the efficiency of the academic enterprise model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Its antitumor activity is mediated by its ability to act directly on the tumor cell, activating apoptosis pathways and indirectly inhibiting the process of inflammation, angiogenesis, and metastasis in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, it has a preventive activity such as radio and/or chemosensitizer. These effects have been evident in in vitro assays but have also been corroborated in patient trials either through the isolated use of curcumin or through its association with other agents. Moreover, curcumin has demonstrated a low induction of side effects. Numerous patents have been developed in connection with the administration and use of curcumin against different types of cancer. All this justifies the interest for the development of new laboratory studies and especially of clinical trials to validate this compound as a dietary supplement in both the healthy and the oncological population. The present review aims to address the most recent in vitro investigations and the latest clinical trials and patents related to the curcumin agent to provide an up-to-date overview of the latest advances in relation to its antitumor effect.",2018,Oncology; Nutrition & Dietetics
A Comparative Analysis of the Legal Framework and Case Law on Reverse Payment Settlement Agreements in the United States and South Korea,; ,"In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark decision, FTC v. Actavis, in which it ordered the lower courts to apply the rule of reason to reverse payment settlement agreements. As the leading jurisdiction for antitrust and intellectual property laws, the United States is once again poised to influence foreign jurisdictions on the issue of reverse payment settlement agreements. In this context, South Korea presents a ripe opportunity for a comparative study because it recently adopted a patent-approval linkage system under which reverse payment settlement agreements will likely become a contentious issue. In particular, the South Korean Supreme Court's recent case, GlaxoSmithKline v. Korea Fair Trade Commission, offers valuable insight into how Korean courts will likely approach this issue. This Comment contends that the U.S. case law, including Actavis, offers important insights for the Korean legal community and that Korea's experiment has potential to offering a fresh approach in tackling reverse payment settlement agreements.",2015,Government & Law

This article explores the consequences of the UK's withdrawal from the EU for intellectual property (IP) law and policy. Compared with other fields such as Economic and Monetary Union and the development of the EU's 'social chapter', the UK has been a supportive and proactive player in internal market integration, particularly pertaining to IP protection. As a result of 'Brexit', the EU may find that the impetus for further harmonization and integration in this field is lost, such as with the EU unitary patent. However, the consequences for the UK are likely to be more severe - a loss of influence, both over laws that govern it and in exporting IP norms internationally, as well as a loss of access to certain protections, agencies and market sectors that are within the UK's economic interests.",2017,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Estimating the cost of strategic entry delay in pharmaceuticals: The case of Ambien CR,Pharmaceutical innovation; Entry; Regulation; Advertising; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; PRICES,"With the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, the FDA included an unchallengeable exclusivity period for newly approved drugs, independent of patents. This potentially generates an incentive for firms to strategically delay the introduction of new versions (reformulations) of drugs until just before patent expiration of the original drug. This way the reformulated drug competes mainly with newly introduced generics of the original drug. If instead, the reformulated drug was to be introduced well before the original drug's patent expires, the reformulated drug would compete only with the original drug. While the pattern of strategic delay is well documented in the literature, its effects on consumers and firms are not. Reformulations may increase utility through improved efficacy and through fewer doses per day or a more even molecule decay rate. However, as suggested in the press and literature, it is also possible that the adoption of reformulated products is mostly the result of advertising rather than product-related benefits. Using detailed prescribing and pricing data from the prescription sleep aid market, I document significant adoption of the reformulation Ambien CR and show that it is not only driven by advertising. I use these estimates to evaluate two different policies designed to induce earlier entry of Ambien CR. I find that there are large potential gains in consumer surplus and in revenue.",2016,Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences
Actavis v. ICOS Decision of the Supreme Court 27 March 2019-Case No. [2019] UKSC 15,Validity of a patent; Inventive step; Obviousness test; State of the art; Dosage of a patented compound; Balance or symmetry in patent law; ,"In addressing the statutory question of obviousness in Sec. 3 of the 1977 UK Patents Act it is common for English courts to adopt the so-called structure. An alternative approach which the EPO often adopts is the so-called problem-and-solution approach. While both approaches focus on the inventive concept put forward in the claims, neither approach should be applied in a mechanistic way. The question of obviousness must be considered on the facts of each case. Factors which can be relevant in addressing the question of obviousness include the following: First, it is relevant to consider whether at the priority date something was obvious to try, in other words whether it was obvious to undertake a specific piece of research which had a reasonable or fair prospect of success. The relevance of the obvious to try consideration and its weight when balanced against other relevant considerations depend on the particular facts of the case. Secondly, it follows that the routine nature of the research and any established practice of following such research through to a particular point may be a relevant consideration. Thirdly, the burden and cost of the research programme is relevant. Fourthly, the necessity for and the nature of the value judgments which the skilled team would have in the course of a testing programme are relevant considerations. Fifthly, the existence of alternative or multiple paths of research will often be an indicator that the invention contained in the claim or claims was not obvious. Sixthly, the motive of the skilled person is a relevant consideration. The notional skilled person is not assumed to undertake technical trials for the sake of doing so but rather because he or she has some end in mind. The absence of a motive to take the allegedly inventive step makes an argument of obviousness more difficult. Seventhly, the fact that the results of research which the inventor actually carried out are unexpected or surprising is a relevant consideration as it may point to an inventive step. Eighthly, one must not use hindsight, which includes knowledge of the invention, in addressing the statutory question of obviousness. Ninthly, it is necessary to consider whether a feature of a claimed invention is an added benefit in a context in which the claimed innovation is obvious for another purpose. A tenth consideration is the nature of the invention. The possibility that a dosage patent with such claims may be valid has been recognized both by the EPO and in the United Kingdom courts. In the absence of a legal error by the trial judge the Court of Appeal is justified in differing from a trial judge's assessment of obviousness if the appellate court were to reach the view that the judge's conclusion was outside the bounds within which reasonable disagreement is possible.",2019,Government & Law

Three isoforms having different biophysical functions are expressed in peripheral and central nerve. Since the withdrawal of mibefradil, the first compound marketed for selective T-type calcium channel blockade, extensive efforts have been made to identify more selective T-type calcium channel blockers. Areas covered: This review covers the 43 patents describing 'organic small molecules as T-type calcium channel blockers'-published since 2012. The most recent similar patent review was published in 2011. Information from a recent review article and relevant research papers has been included, as well as biological data and clinical trial results where available. Expert opinion: Triazinone derivatives, carbazole compounds, and aryl triazole/imidazole amide derivatives display potent blockade activity alpha 1H, alpha 1G, and pan T-type calcium channel subtypes, respectively, though the specificity of the letter is still unsatisfactory. Nonetheless, improvements seen in the efficacy of compounds targeting alpha 1H T-type calcium channels indicate significant progress. Ongoing clinical trials are for the candidates Z944 (Phase II) and ACT-709478 (Phase II) appear promising.

This study investigated whether the residual I IRV (rHRV) measures can better discriminate patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from patients with patent coronary artery (PCA) than traditional HRV measures. Materials and methods: The rHRV and HRV measures of 48 patients with AMI and 69 patients with PCA were compared. Results: The high-frequency power of rHRV spectrum was significantly enhanced while the low-frequency and very low-frequency powers of rHRV spectrum were significantly suppressed, as compared to their corresponding traditional HRV spectrum in both groups of patients. The normalized residual high-frequency power (nrHFP = residual high-frequency power/residual total power) was significantly greater than the corresponding normalized high-frequency power in both groups of patients. Between-groups comparison showed that the nril FP in AMI patients was significantly smaller than that in PCA patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the nrHFP or nrHFP + normalized residual very low-frequency power (residual very low-frequency power/rTP) had better discrimination capability than the corresponding HRV measures for predicting AMI. Conclusions: Compared with traditional HRV measures, the rHRV measures can slightly better differentiate AMI patients from PCA patients, especially the nrHFP or nrHFP + normalized residual very low-frequency power.",2018,Health Care Sciences & Services

We find that R&D intensity has a positive effect on firm growth rate while R&D scale a negative effect on the firm growth rate at the upper quantile, whereas the result is opposite at the lower quantile. Firm size has a mixed relationship with sales growth at the upper quantile, thus Gibrat's law is rejected in the Korean pharmaceutical industry. Firm age has a negative relationship with the sales growth rate at the upper quantile, which shows the consistent result with previous research that young firms grow faster. Patent persistence has a negative relationship with sales growth at the upper quantile, while a positive effect at the lower quantile. We show that young firms and firms with high R&D intensity contribute to the high growth rate, while the relationship is not clear at the lower quantile. Therefore, policy implication in this research is that the government should pay attention to encouraging and supporting R&D investment activities and small firms as well as consider ways to enhance patent rights.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

In order to consider and to distinguish between these two types of research, we merge the seminal models of Romer [1990] and Aghion and Howitt [1992]: knowledge accumulation stems from a series of inventions (horizontal / fundamental knowledge accumulation) and from a succession of innovations (vertical / applied knowledge accumulation) building upon each of these inventions. Then, we study a decentralized economy in which the creative destruction mechanism does not deter investments in fundamental research through an IP law design that induces profit-division between an inventor and his following innovators. We show that providing optimal incentives to fundamental research requires, not only a design of IP law that ensures a sufficient positive transfer from innovators to inventors, but also public policies in form of subsidies supporting both fundamental research and applied R&D activities.",2018,Business & Economics; Government & Law
The Problem of Reverse Payments in the Pharmaceutical Industry Following Actavis,; ,"Reverse payments are payments that are made as a component of a patent infringement settlement, between a brand-name pharmaceutical company to a competitor who is attempting to market a generic version of the patented brand-name drug. The patentee not only drops its patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer, but also compensates this alleged infringer. Reverse payment settlements raise antitrust concerns because they suggest that the generic manufacturer could have proved the brand-name's patent either invalid or non-infringed, and thus entered the marketplace to provide consumers with lower priced generic drugs, if they had continued with the litigation. This also insinuates that the motive behind the payment was to persuade the generic manufacturer to delay marketing its lower priced drug, and therefore prolong the brand-name company's monopoly. By settling with the generic manufacturer, the brand-name company is able to continue selling its pharmaceutical at a monopoly-set price, at the expense of consumers who are forced to pay higher costs for their medications. In FTC v. Actavis, Inc., the Supreme Court held that reverse payment settlements sometimes violate antitrust laws, and that each settlement should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, under the antitrust rule of reason standard, to determine if it is illegal. Under the rule of reason, courts must weigh the procompetitive and anticompetitive effects of the settlement to determine whether the payment is reasonable. The Supreme Court, however, declined to provide a framework for the rule of reason analysis of reverse payment settlements, leaving it to the lower courts to establish. Following this decision, district courts have diverged greatly in their application of Actavis to the reverse payment settlements before them. Some courts believe Actavis directs antitrust scrutiny only to settlements involving monetary payment, while others believe the holding also applies to noncash settlements. This Note argues that Actavis antitrust scrutiny should be applied not only to monetary settlements, but also to nonmonetary settlements, because reverse payments can bring a risk of significant anticompetitive effects regardless of the particular form of the transfer of value. Additionally, this Note proposes a model of analysis to apply when determining whether the terms of a nonmonetary settlement violate antitrust law.",2015,Government & Law
Competition Law and IP Rights: Not So Complementary: Time for Re-alignment of the Goals?,; ANTITRUST; PROTECTION; EFFICIENCY; ECONOMICS; CONSUMER; COSTS,"This article argues through a US/EU comparative assessment of the intellectual property (IP) law goals and competition law goals that whilst the overarching goals of competition law and IP rights to enhance overall economic welfare are still complementary, internal conflicts within the two legal spheres are jeopardizing the achievement of these goals. Within the IP laws the private/public reward/incentive to innovate equilibrium is now being tilted in favour of private interests due to recent developments in terms of rapid innovation in digital economy markets and technologies coupled with an expansion of IP rights and increase in patents grants and their width. This has a knock-on effect on the application of the competition rules as a second-tier regulator of IP rights. However, the competition rules also face its own battle in keeping up with the fast-developing digital economy, the concerns regarding Big Data and online platforms raising questions about the sustainability of the 'consumer welfare' framework as an optimal standard to ensure effective competition in these markets. Consequently, there is a danger that the competition rules and the IP rights will be out of quilter, risking stifling of innovation and harm to consumer welfare, unless adjustment is made within the two legal spheres.",2019,Government & Law
The Role of Governments in the Spread of Novel Computing Devices in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century United States,; ,"Nineteenth and early twentieth century American governments-local, state, and national-profoundly shaped diffusion of novel mathematical instruments. The federal government ran an office that judged what inventions were patentable and a legal system for those who defended or challenged patent rights. Governments at all levels employed inventors. Sometimes new laws required extensive calculations promoting invention and sale of computing instruments. Governments were customers for mathematical instruments ranging from teaching apparatus to adding and calculating machines to harmonic analyzers to tabulating machines. They not only bought goods, but set standards for what they would purchase. Government buyers also offered testimonials to businesses. From the 1890s, antitrust legislation led to some federal government oversight of corporations. Historians usually rely on documents to tell this story. This paper begins from objects-a few known only from patent descriptions, but most surviving in museum collections. This perspective complements rich existing accounts.",2019,Computer Science; History & Philosophy of Science
Causation in Reverse Payment Antitrust Claims,; ,"Following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2013 holding in FTC v. Actavis, Inc. that antitrust liability can attach to reverse payment patent settlements, courts have diverged about how to determine whether private parties who prove that such an agreement violates antitrust law are entitled to any relief. Unresolved issues about the private plaintiff causation requirement are likely to recur as more courts reach the issue. This Note identifies two approaches to causation. Under a narrow approach adopted by the First and Third Circuits, private plaintiffs are required to piece together precise details about what would have happened if the patent litigation had not settled including details the Supreme Court expressly held were usually unnecessary to pin down in government enforcement cases. In contrast, the California Supreme Court and several federal district courts have drawn a broader causal inference. For these courts, causation exists whenever a challenged settlement delays competition in expectation. This Note explains why the broader approach better aligns with the rationales undergirding private enforcement of the prohibition against certain reverse payment settlement agreements.",2018,Government & Law
The Politics of Narcotic Medicines in Early Twentieth-Century South Africa,patent medicines; opioids; drug regulation; colonialism; South Africa; CAPE COLONY; OPIUM; RACISM; TRADE,"Controls over trade and consumption of narcotic medicines emerged as both a concern and emblem of progressive governance around the turn of the twentieth century. This article traces political struggles over drugs regulation in the case of colonial South Africa. It focuses on two parallel streams of law-making by the British occupation regime in the Transvaal, following the Anglo-Boer war. Controversies over the availability of traditional 'Dutch medicines' to Boer farmers and prohibitions of certain patent medicines to African consumers were elements of, and contradictions within, the process of building a modern pharmaceutical economy. An influx to the region of new curatives coincided with the growth of vernacular newspapers as well as temperance campaigns. Working to nurture white national cohesion and support a mining industry premised on unskilled black labour, the South African state created race-based drugs controls. These developments proved significant to regulatory statecraft later in the century.",2019,History; History & Philosophy of Science
TRIPS and Competition Rules: From Transfer of Technology to Innovation Policy,; ,"The competition-related provisions in the TRIPS Agreement were very much influenced by the context in which the Agreement was concluded. The inclusion of competition provisions served a specific purpose. Competition law was basically seen as a tool to facilitate the transfer of technology. Twenty years after the entry into force of TRIPS, the legal landscape within which IPRs are exercised has experienced tremendous changes on the IP front, as well as on the competition law front. IP protection tends to be raised beyond the minimum standards of TRIPS, questionable protection has been granted specially in the field of patents, enforcement mechanisms and remedies have been strengthened and IP portfolios are strategically used in the markets. From an international perspective, higher IP standards have been exported through bilateral and regional trade agreements. Competition law is developing at a very fast speed, especially in emerging and developing economies. Moreover, competition law and IP laws are increasingly understood as being complementary to each other. A strict and conflict oriented reading of TRIPS' competition provisions does not help to cope with the new strategies of innovation and the new forms of use of IPRs. We argue in this paper that a flexible reading of the competition-related provisions in TRIPS provides enough room for applying competition law as an innovation instrument. Hence, the application of competition law to combat IP-related restraints of competition that inhibit innovation would be covered by the rationale of the TRIPS Agreement just as much as an application of competition law aimed at enhancing access to and dissemination of IP-protected products.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Intellectual property rights reform and the cost of corporate debt,Intellectual property rights; Bank loans; PATENT PROTECTION; CREDITOR RIGHTS; LAWS; INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS; MARKET; LIFE,"This paper investigates the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection on the cost of bank loans for firms in 48 countries. Using substantial reforms of patent rights as a source of identifying variation, the paper provides strong evidence that borrowers from countries that underwent IPR reform experience significant reductions in the cost of bank debt. Importantly, the effects of IPR reform on loan rates are significantly larger in industries that are more IP-intensive. Additional analysis shows that in the wake of reforms borrowers obtain larger size loans, which indicates that improvements in IPR are associated with greater credit availability. IPR reform also increases foreign lenders participation in loan syndicates. Overall, these findings suggest that legal protection afforded to intellectual property has a significant impact on the cost of corporate borrowing and the ability of innovative firms to raise debt capital.

This foundational technology enables modification of the genetic structure of any living organisms with unprecedented precision. Yet, in order to enhance its potential for societal benefit, it is necessary to adapt rules and produce adequate regulations. This requires an interdisciplinary effort in legal thinking. Any legislative initiative needs to consider both the benefits and the problematic aspects of gene editing, from a broader societal and value-based perspective. This paper stems from an interdisciplinary research project seeking to identify and discuss some of the most pressing legal implications of gene-editing technology and how to address these. While the questions raised by gene editing are global, laws and regulations are to a great extent bound by national borders. This paper presents a European perspective, written for a global audience, and intends to contribute to the global debate. The analysis will include brief references to corresponding USA rules in order to place these European debates in the broader international context. Our legal analysis incorporates interdisciplinary contributes concerning the scientific state of the art, philosophical thinking regarding the precautionary principle and dual-use issues as well as the importance of communication, social perception, and public debate. Focusing mainly in the main regulatory and patent law issues, we will argue that (a) general moratoriums and blank prohibitions do a disservice to science and innovation; (b) it is crucial to carefully consider a complex body of international and European fundamental rights norms applicable to gene editing; (c) these require further developments grounded in consistent and coherent implementation and interpretation; (d) legal development should follow a critical contextual approach capable of integrating interdisciplinary contributions and broad multilevel societal dialog.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine
Immunities of International Organizations Before Domestic Courts: Reflections on the Collective Labour Case Against the European Patent Organization,Immunity; International organizations; The Netherlands; Right to a remedy; Collective labour law; ,"The Netherlands is home to a substantial number of international organizations, which on the basis of international agreements are entitled to immunity from jurisdiction and enforcement before Dutch courts. This immunity grant has not stopped claimants from suing international organizations in The Netherlands, sometimes successfully. Dutch courts have indeed proved willing to entertain claims that a particular activity of the organization was not necessary for the fulfilment of its functions, or that the organization failed to offer an alternative remedy. In a recent case against the European Patent Organization, a Dutch court dismissed the organization's immunity on the ground that it failed to offer an alternative remedy and that the impugned substantive violations rose to the level of fundamental rights violations. The author supports this approach, with some reservations, but regrets the quasi-absolute immunity from enforcement which international organizations continue to enjoy.",2016,Government & Law
BROADLY UNPATENTABLE: HOW BROAD METHOD CLAIMS HAVE LIMITED PATENTABILITY OF DIAGNOSTIC INVENTIONS,; ON-A-CHIP; RECENT PROGRESS,"Diagnostic tests are often patented using broad method claims, which allow inventors to secure the greatest possible protection for their inventions. However, several recent Supreme Court and Federal Circuit cases invalidated broad diagnostic method claims under 35 U.S.C. 101, holding that the claims were directed to unpatentable abstract ideas, natural laws, or natural phenomena. In light of these decisions, the continued patentability of diagnostic inventions has been called into question. However, this Note argues that these invalidations were partially due to the breadth of the claims at issue and that diagnostic inventions may still survive 101 challenges if they are claimed narrowly using machine, manufacture, or composition of matter claims rather than or in addition to method claims.

Unipessoal Decision of the Supreme Court 22 March 2018-Case No. 1053/16.5YRLSB.S1.S1,Arbitral tribunal; Constitutionality; Generic drugs; Marketing authorisation; Patent nullity exception; Incidental competence; ,"Law No. 62/2011, of 12 December, subjected the resolution of industrial property rights disputes concerning reference drugs and generic drugs to necessary arbitration. Under that scheme, the legislator intended to create a mechanism by which - in a short period of time - a decision on the merits could be obtained as to the infringement (or lack thereof) of industrial property rights in respect of such medicinal products, replacing the national courts in the assessment of these disputes. The question of the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to assess the validity or otherwise of a duly registered patent that grants rights incompatible with the marketing authorisation of the generic medicinal product has been raised. Two opposing theories have emerged both in the courts and in legal writing, namely a limited one and a broader one. The subject was examined for the first time by the Supreme Court of Justice in its judgment of 14 December 2016, which decided to follow the more limited one, since allowing the incidental deduction of the peremptory plea of nullity of the patent would imply an undisputed dysfunctionality. Without prejudice to the value of each of the opposing theses, it is understood (in line with the judgment referred to in point IV) that the one best suited to the aims and interests in question - according to the elements of interpretation of the law which must prevail (Art. 9 of the Civil Code) - will be the one that sustains the inadmissibility of the analysis by the arbitral tribunal of the validity of the patent in purely incidental terms, by way of exception, even if only effects. The Supreme Court held that since there is unanimity in the sense of Art. 35(1) of the Industrial Property Code granting a reservation of exclusive substantive competence to the Court of Intellectual Property in relation to the declaration of nullity or of annulment of the patent, with effectiveness, the best solution will be to deny jurisdiction of the necessary arbitral tribunal to judge on such validity or invalidity, even if it is invoked as a mere peremptory exception and with limited effects on the file. Notwithstanding the value of the reasoning of the Judgement by the Constitutional Court of 24 May 2017 (until now the only judgement issued on the matter) - which concluded that the interpretation that prevented the incidental analysis of the validity of the patent by the necessary arbitral tribunal was unconstitutional - we consider the advocated solution as it derives from the explicit reasoning of the Supreme Court of Justice's decision mentioned in point IV which we follow, does not disproportionately restrict the right of defence of the holder of the marketing authorisation. This is because the possibility of lodging a claim for declaration of nullity or annulment is an effective alternative to guarantee the defence of the applicant for a marketing authorisation.",2019,Government & Law

We report the radiographic images and complete magnetic resonance (MR) features of a 44-year-old male with right knee pain of 7 months' duration. The radiographic findings and convention MR images indicated a giant cell tumor of the bone. The dynamic contrast-enhanced images showed a patent with the early wash-in and early wash-out usually noted in a giant cell tumor of the bone. Only water restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed the malignant impression. Care should be taken when conventional images indicate giant cell tumor of the bone, as intraosseous myoepithelial carcinoma, although rare, can mimic this more common diagnosis.

Legal Decision Support: Exploring Big Data Analytics Approach to Modeling Pharma Patent Validity Cases,Big data analytics; Hadoop MapReduce; legal decision making; machine learning; pharma patent validity; LAW; AI,"This exploratory research examines the potential for applying a big data analytic framework to the modeling and analysis of cases in pharmaceutical patent validity brought before the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit. We start with two specific goals: one, to identify the key issues or reasons the Court uses to makes validity decisions and, two, to attempt to predict outcomes for new cases. The ultimate goal is to support legal decision-making with automation. The legal domain is a challenging one to tackle. However, current advances in analytic technologies and models hold the promise of success. Our application of Hadoop MapReduce in conjunction with a number of algorithms, such as clustering, classification, word count, word co-occurrence, and row similarity, is encouraging, in that the results are robust enough to suggest these approaches have promise and are worth pursuing. By utilizing larger case data sets and sample sizes and by using deep machine learning models in text analytics, more breakthroughs can be achieved to provide decision support to the legal domain. From an economic standpoint, the potential for litigation cost reduction is another objective of our study. Synergies are obtained in applying lessons to the computational field and vice versa, leading to acceleration in our understanding.",2018,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications
"Access and Benefit-Sharing in Canada Glimpses from the National Experiences of Brazil, Namibia and Australia to Inform Indigenous-Sensitive Policy",; ,"Through a review of international obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization (NP) and with reference to other instruments, this chapter surveys national measures related to access and benefit-sharing (ABS) in Brazil, Namibia and Australia. It identifies insights from those experiences as the basis of policy recommendations to shape the existing and evolving ABS framework in Canada. Operationalization of ABS in Canada requires the effective involvement of Indigenous peoples grounded in mutual respect. Empowerment of Indigenous governance of genetic resources (GR) and traditional knowledge (TK), integration of adequate administrative review to evaluate and monitor utilization, facilitation of fair and equitable benefit-sharing and the inclusion of a disclosure of origin requirement in the patent framework provide areas of opportunity to support the implementation of the NP and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Canada.",2019,Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Ethnic Studies; Government & Law

We propose that new inventions reshape networks of interlinked technologies by shifting inventors' attention to or away from the knowledge on which those inventions build. Using this approach, we develop novel indexes of the extent to which a new invention consolidates or destabilizes existing technology streams. We apply these indexes in analyses of university research commercialization and find that, although federal research funding pushes campuses to create inventions that are more destabilizing, deeper commercial ties lead them to produce technologies that consolidate the status quo. By quantifying the effects that new technologies have on their predecessors, the indexes we propose allow patent-based studies of innovation to capture conceptually important phenomena that are not detectable with established measures. The measurement approach presented here offers empirical insights that support theoretical development in studies of innovation, entrepreneurship, technology strategy, science policy, and social network theory.",2017,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
Prescribing trends of inhaler treatments for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease within a resource-constrained environment in the Scottish national health service: findings and implications,Asthma; COPD; inhalers; Scottish NHS; expenditure; reforms; drug utilisation; PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS; FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE; COPD; INITIATIVES; SALMETEROL; MANAGEMENT; DEVICES; IMPACT; MEDICATIONS; EFFICIENCY,"Background: There is an increasing prevalence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worldwide, leading to increased inhaler use. However, there are concerns with inhaler compliance resulting in different patented inhalers and longer-acting formulations. As a result, inhalers are now among the highest expenditure items in ambulatory care in Scotland leading to multiple initiatives to keep within budget without compromising care. Method: This study assesses inhaler utilization and expenditure between 2001 and 2017 alongside health authority initiatives. Results: There was an increase by 137% in inhaler utilization between 2001 and 2017, and a two-fold increase in expenditure, driven by the increasing use of patented combination inhalers to address concerns. This is very different to the oral markets where expenditure on proton pump inhibitors, statins, and antihypertensives have fallen considerably recently despite increased volumes due to the increasing use of low-cost generics. However, inhaler expenditure has started to fall with an increasing use of lower cost combinations and initiatives to reduce the steroid burden alongside monitoring patient care. Conclusion: Challenges with using and changing inhalers has meant this market has not followed other high-volume drug classes following patent loss. This is starting to change, with the situation monitored to enhance efficient prescribing alongside continued good quality care.",2019,Respiratory System
Malaria testing and treatment knowledge among selected rural patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMV) in Nigeria,Malaria treatment; Patent and proprietary medicine vendors; Diagnosis; Rapid diagnostic tests; ,"BackgroundMalaria is a leading cause of illness and death in Nigeria, but access of poor people to quality anti-malarial services remains low especially in the rural areas. Patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs) provide the majority of malaria treatment in rural areas, but little is known about their knowledge of malaria testing and treatment of uncomplicated malaria as recommended in the 2011 National Malaria Control Programme policy.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted in two purposively selected states (Oyo and Bayelsa) in Nigeria with each state representing a different geographic and linguistic-ethnic region in the southern part of the country. Two rural LGAs were randomly selected from each state and data were collected from 160 randomly selected PPMVS (40 per LGA) using a structured questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics.ResultsThe 2011 National Policy on Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment is mostly unknown to PPMVs. Although most PPMVs (89%) knew that artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is recommended in the national policy, 91% also thought non-ACT were endorsed. The proportion of PPMVs who stated they would treat a malaria case with an artemisinin-based combination at the correct dose was 33% for a child under five, 47% for an adult male and 14% for a pregnant woman in her second trimester. The proportion of PPMVs who reported they would diagnose a case of malaria prior to treatment using a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kit was 1.9% for children under five, 7.5% for adult males and 3.1% for pregnant women in their first trimester due to lack of knowledge. Almost two-thirds (65.6%) would correctly refer children with severe malaria to health facility.ConclusionsSubstantial knowledge gaps on the use of RDTs and treatment with artemisinin-based combinations exist among rural PPMVs. Given existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of private retail outlets in malaria case management, PPMVs should be provided with competency-based training and supervision to improve the quality of care they provide.",2019,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine

Given the lack of extant adequate indicators, a new scale was developed based on the most frequently cited constructs in the literature. A sample of 1,401 researchers from Portuguese universities was administered a questionnaire and the data collected permitted a validation with regards to the psychometric properties of the questionnaire, to see its applicability to the study. The findings suggest that the absence of a patenting history or start-up portfolio act as significant barriers to academic entrepreneurship. However, when the institutional strategy is to increase patenting and spin-off activities, the university should begin investing in creating a networking environment capable of reinforcing the researchers' Social Capital. Observing the example of successful entrepreneurs motivates other researchers to consider the possibility of developing their own ventures. The Structural Equations Modelling (SEM) approach allowed for us to identify and measure the non-linear relationships that shape the core of KBE and influence the attainment of measurable outcomes aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship. A relatively high share of the variance of the dependent variables is explained by the model, ensuring their representativeness and contributing to the state-of-art of the knowledge in this research field.",2016,Business & Economics
The Risks of Revolution: Ethical Dilemmas in 3D Printing from a US Perspective,3D printing; Additive manufacturing (AM); Ethics of technology; Intellectual property; Safety; ,"Additive manufacturing has spread widely over the past decade, especially with the availability of home 3D printers. In the future, many items may be manufactured at home, which raises two ethical issues. First, there are questions of safety. Our current safety regulations depend on centralized manufacturing assumptions; they will be difficult to enforce on this new model of manufacturing. Using current US law as an example, I argue that consumers are not capable of fully assessing all relevant risks and thus continue to require protection; any regulation will likely apply to plans, however, not physical objects. Second, there are intellectual property issues. In combination with a 3D scanner, it is now possible to scan items and print copies; many items are not protected from this by current intellectual property laws. I argue that these laws are ethically sufficient. Patent exists to protect what is innovative; the rest is properly not protected. Intellectual property rests on the notion of creativity, but what counts as creative changes with the rise of new technologies.",2016,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Engineering; History & Philosophy of Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Philosophy

ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TRADEMARKS? AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF TRADEMARK DEPLETION AND CONGESTION,; AMERICAN ENGLISH; BRAND NAMES; WORD-LENGTH; LAW; LANGUAGE; PATENTS,"American trademark law has long operated on the assumption that there exists an inexhaustible supply of unclaimed trademarks that are at least as competitively effective as those already claimed. This core empirical assumption underpins nearly every aspect of trademark law and policy. This Article presents empirical evidence showing that this conventional wisdom is wrong. The supply of competitively effective trademarks is, in fact, exhaustible and has already reached severe levels of what we term trademark depletion and trademark congestion. We systematically study all 6.7 million trademark applications filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) from 1985 through 2016 together with the 300,000 trademarks already registered at the PTO as of 1985. We analyze these data in light of the most frequently used words and syllables in American English, the most frequently occurring surnames in the United States, and an original dataset consisting of phonetic representations of each applied-for or registered word mark included in the PTO's Trademark Case Files Dataset. We further incorporate data consisting of all 128 million domain names registered in the. com top-level domain and an original dataset of all 2.1 million trademark office actions issued by the PTO from 2003 through 2016. These data show that rates of word-mark depletion and congestion are increasing and have reached chronic levels, particularly in certain important economic sectors. The data further show that new trademark applicants are increasingly being forced to resort to second-best, less competitively effective marks. Yet registration refusal rates continue to rise. The result is that the ecology of the trademark system is breaking down, with mounting barriers to entry, increasing consumer search costs, and an eroding public domain. In light of our empirical findings, we propose a mix of reforms to trademark law that will help to preserve the proper functioning of the trademark system and further its core purposes of promoting competition and enhancing consumer welfare.",2018,Government & Law
How Private Property Protection Influences the Impact of Intellectual Property Rights on Economic Growth?,private property protection; quantile regression; economic growth; Intellectual property rights; QUANTILE REGRESSION; PATENT PROTECTION; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; INNOVATION; COUNTRIES; FLOWS; LAWS; FDI,"Abstract Although policy-makers typically assume a positive relationship between intellectual property rights (IPRs) and economic growth, the empirical evidence on the IPR-growth relationship is rather inconclusive. We conjecture in this paper that the weak IPR-growth evidence in previous studies may be due to a neglect of the role of finance markets and private property rights. Our conjecture is motivated by the recent law-and-finance literature. We test our conjecture with a cross-section of 98 countries and find that once we modify our measure of IPRs to take into account general property rights, there is stronger evidence for a positive relationship between IPRs and economic growth. Our findings not only help explain the IPR-innovation puzzle but also have significant theoretical as well as policy implications.",2015,Business & Economics
Baseball Bats and Chocolate Chip Cookies: The Judicial Treatment of DNA in the Myriad Genetics Litigation,; ,"In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a controversial ruling that naturally occurring DNA segments are products of nature and therefore not patentable subject matter. At this intersection between science and law, in litigation of crucial importance to patients, science, and multibillion-dollar biotech enterprises, the appellate judges sidestepped genetics and engaged in a war of metaphors from diamonds to chocolate chip cookies. This case is not an outlier. Apprehensive judges and juries in both Canada and the United States find many convenient excuses to avoid coming to grips with the underlying science in patent cases. But this is simply not acceptable. Legal rulings must be, and must seem to be, well grounded, as a matter of both law and science. The legitimacy of court decisions in the eyes of the stakeholders and the broader public depends on it.",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine
An Open Source Business Model for Malaria,; ERADICATION,"Greater investment is required in developing new drugs and vaccines against malaria in order to eradicate malaria. These precious funds must be carefully managed to achieve the greatest impact. We evaluate existing efforts to discover and develop new drugs and vaccines for malaria to determine how best malaria R&D can benefit from an enhanced open source approach and how such a business model may operate. We assess research articles, patents, clinical trials and conducted a smaller survey among malaria researchers. Our results demonstrate that the public and philanthropic sectors are financing and performing the majority of malaria drug/vaccine discovery and development, but are then restricting access through patents, 'closed' publications and hidden away physical specimens. This makes little sense since it is also the public and philanthropic sector that purchases the drugs and vaccines. We recommend that a more open source approach is taken by making the entire value chain more efficient through greater transparency which may lead to more extensive collaborations. This can, for example, be achieved by empowering an existing organization like the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) to act as a clearing house for malaria-related data. The malaria researchers that we surveyed indicated that they would utilize such registry data to increase collaboration. Finally, we question the utility of publicly or philanthropically funded patents for malaria medicines, where little to no profits are available. Malaria R&D benefits from a publicly and philanthropically funded architecture, which starts with academic research institutions, product development partnerships, commercialization assistance through UNITAID and finally procurement through mechanisms like The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the U.S.' President's Malaria Initiative. We believe that a fresh look should be taken at the cost/benefit of patents particularly related to new malaria medicines and consider alternative incentives, like WHO prequalification.",2015,Science & Technology - Other Topics
The Role of Courts in Technology Policy,; STATUTORY INTERPRETATION; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LEGAL DOCTRINE; DECISIONS; HISTORY,"When established firms sue a newcomer who has developed a technology that threatens their business, and the copyright and patent laws are unclear as to whether the challenged use is illegal, what are the welfare consequences of various judicial rulings? This question is usually answered by conceptualizing the court's decision as the final choice of policy. But that is misleading because the court's decision merely forms the baseline from which Congress, lobbied by interest groups, enacts the final policy. I present a formal model that captures this dynamic context. The model shows that the court's optimal decision is to rule for the resource-constrained party, which is often the newcomer, even when the opposite ruling would be preferable if the court were the final policy maker. The model's logic is illustrated by case studies of Supreme Court decisions on copyright law.",2018,Business & Economics; Government & Law
The political economy of international transitional administration: regulating food and farming in Kosovo and Iraq,International law; political economy; international transitional administration (ITA); agriculture; Kosovo; Iraq; LAW,"This article reconstructs how democratic participation and interference can be fended off by the construction of an international authoritarian political architecture and a strongly legalised and specific form of market economy. We do this by interrogating International Territorial Administration (ITA) regulations established to administer post-conflict Kosovo and post-invasion Iraq. In following the regulations and executive decrees of a largely unaccountable international policy-making bureaucracy in reforming the agricultural sector, the article demonstrates how and with what impact an authoritarian-liberal approach to economic reform materialised in the agricultural sectors of post-conflict Kosovo and Iraq. The regulation of land reform and patent law in turn served in these cases to establish distributional outcomes in favour of large-scale agricultural interests and multinational corporations. Even though the two administrations focused on different aspects of land and agriculture regulation, we argue that significant commonalities exist between their political preferences and interests. Our work draws on the tradition of critical legal studies in International Law (IL) and we posit that by drawing on this tradition, scholarship on post-conflict international territorial administration is better able to capture the long-term ramifications of international intervention.",2018,Government & Law
Corporate innovation in China and its implications,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT; FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS; ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES; ENTREPRENEURIAL STATE; MARKET VALUATION; AGENCY COSTS; OWNERSHIP; LAW; COMPETITION,"China's current economic transition policies focus on shifting from export-driven manufacturing towards high-end, high-tech research and development (R&D), and domestic consumption. Since the early 2000s the government has issued a series of policies and guidelines to encourage innovation. Both in-house R&D investment and the number of patent grants/applications have seen considerable growth in recent years. More specifically, industry-funded R&D was responsible for more than three quarters of total in-house R&D investment. Despite the rapid growth in R&D expenditure and the number of patents, China's corporate innovation still faces many obstacles and challenges. To further stimulate corporate innovation, the government may need to create an environment of fair competition for domestic enterprises, encourage the growth of institutional investors and their active participation in corporate governance, and improve the efficiency of financial systems.

CAPTURING VALUE FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) IN A GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT,Appropriation strategy; counterfeit; intellectual property rights; litigation; value capturing; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; STRATEGIES; PATENTS,"Globalization should provide firms with an opportunity to leverage their know-how and reputation across countries to create value. However, it remains challenging for them to actually capture that value using traditional Intellectual Property (IP) tools. In this paper, we document the strong growth in patents, trademarks, and industrial designs used by firms to protect their IP globally. We then show that IP protection remains fragmented; the quality of IP applications might be questionable; and developing a comprehensive IP footprint worldwide is very costly. Growing numbers of applications are causing backlogs and delays in numerous Patent and Trademarks Offices and litigation over IP rights is expensive, with an uncertain outcome. Moreover, local governments can succeed in transferring value to local firms and influencing global market positions by using IP laws and other regulations. In essence, the analysis shows a global IP environment that leaves much to be desired. Despite these challenges, there are successful strategies to capture value from know-how and reputation by leveraging an array of IP tools. These strategies have important implications for management practice, as we discuss in our concluding section. Global companies will need to organize cross-functional value capture teams focused on appropriating value from their know-how and reputation by combining different institutional, market, and nonmarket tools, depending on the institutional and business environment in a particular region.",2017,Business & Economics
The impact of the German feed-in tariff scheme on innovation: Evidence based on patent filings in renewable energy technologies,Renewable energy promotion; Feed-in tariffs; Innovation; ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY INSTRUMENTS; TECHNICAL CHANGE; COUNT DATA; DIFFUSION; US; SUPPORT; MODELS,"Over the last two decades, feed-in tariffs have pushed the massive expansion of electricity from renewable energy sources in Germany. Between 1991 and 1999, feed-in tariffs were prescribed through the Electricity Feed-in Law - the so-called Stromeinspeisungsgesetz (SEG) - at relatively moderate rates. From 2000 onwards, the SEG was replaced by the Renewable Energy Sources Act - the so-called Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG) - with much higher subsidy rates. The rise in subsidies to renewable power generation under the EEG came along with a substantial increase in electricity prices provoking an intense public debate on the benefits of renewable energy promotion. In our regression analysis, we assess one popular justification for feed-in tariffs: the demand side effect of induced innovation. We find that the innovation impact of the German feed-in tariff scheme over the last two decades supports the positive innovation hypothesis. However, the inducement effect of the feed-in tariff scheme under the EEG is not significantly different from that of the SEG. Given the drastic cost of the EEG, we caution against the appraisal of the EEG feed-in tariff scheme solely on the grounds of its impact on technological innovation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These political processes prompted questions concerning the nature and functions of university research: How is academic science different than other forms of knowledge production? What are the contributions of universities for economy and welfare? Who is the rightful owner of scientific findings? Is academic science work? By following the introduction of the professor's privilege, the paper shows how spokespersons for the academic profession addressed such questions and contributed to a new definition of university science through boundary-setting, normative descriptions, and by producing symbolic relationships between science and the economy. The totality of those positions is here referred to as a nomos - that is: a generic and durable set of seemingly axiomatic claims about universities. This Swedish nomos, as it took shape in the 1940s, amalgamated classical notions of academic science as exceptional and autonomous with emerging ideas of inventiveness and close connections between academics and business. Crucially, though, the academic-industrial relations embedded in this nomos were private and individual, thus in sharp conflict with the ideas of entrepreneurial universities evolving globally by the end of the 20th century.",2018,Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics
Quantity and collection decisions in a closed-loop supply chain with technology licensing,Remanufacturing; Patented product; Fixed-fee licensing; Royalty licensing; Game theory; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TAKE-BACK; COMPETITION; STRATEGY; CONTRACTS; CHANNEL; MARKET; PRODUCTS,"Industry practice has shown that technology licensing has an important effect on the remanufacturing of patented products by third parties. Different licensing methods significantly impact a supply chain member's production and collection decisions, and they also have influential effects on reverse channel performance. However, there is scant literature investigating the decision on technology licensing and its impact on a supply chain member's production and collection decisions. To address this gap, we consider a manufacturer, as the patent holder, who produces new and remanufactured products and, simultaneously, he and a remanufacturer (as the licensee, who by law can only produce remanufactured products) competitively collects used products from the market in a two-period closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). We investigate two licensing patterns, fixed fee versus royalty, within the CLSC in a Cournot duopoly model. We find that royalty licensing is dominated by fixed fee licensing from the viewpoints of both the consumer surplus and environmental protection. Our result also shows that the manufacturer's optimal licensing strategy is determined by a threshold of the fixed fee: when the fixed fee is below a threshold, it is better for the manufacturer to use a royalty licensing, whereas fixed-fee licensing should be used when the fixed fee is higher than a threshold.

The relationship between intellectual property and human right and a policy oriented recommendations,Human right; Intellectual Property; Health Right; Right to Life; Patents; ,"The objective of this review is to analyze possible interrelation and conflicts between intellectual property law and human right, with particular attention to the right of health, as well as their impact on social acceptability and effectiveness of the legal norms. Intellectual property protection has been debated for long time because of its impact on the society and the environment. It is important to take into consideration when nation do not adopt the legislation as it makes a back step historically in the protection of human due to the fact that the importance of human rights is established by it's implementation. We will examine different legal mechanism that are used and can be used in order to balance the interest involved, focusing on human rights norms recognized by national and international law. We aim to analyze the different aspects of the relationship between human rights and Intellectual property with a special focus on the right of health. Intellectual property protection, have implication on the right to health and related human rights in a different ways. Intellectual property protection can affect medical research and the access to medicines. We will see how medicines are of decisive importance for the preservation and maintenance of the health of citizens, especially in developing countries which justifies the special attention that governments give to their regulation. A balance must be sought between these international rights and access to medicines by patients in developing countries at affordable prices. Companies need to use patents not only as incentives and mechanisms of innovation, but as strategic assets for the generation and conservation of dominant positions. We will set policy-oriented recommendations with the aim to enhance social acceptability and legitimacy of intellectual property law and guidelines on development of intellectual property norms.",2019,Government & Law
MUSIC AS A MATTER OF LAW,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT; PROTECTION; PATENT; RULES,"What is a musical work? Philosophers debate it, but for judges the answer has long been simple: music means melody. Though few recognize it today, that answer goes all the way back to the birth of music copyright litigation in the nineteenth century. Courts adopted the era's dominant aesthetic view identifying melody as the site of originality and, consequently, the litmus test for similarity. Surprisingly, music's single-element test has persisted as an anomaly within the modern copyright system, where multiple features of eligible subject matter typically are eligible for protection. Yet things are now changing. Recent judicial decisions are beginning to break down the old definitional wall around melody, looking elsewhere within the work to find protected expression. Many have called this increasing scope problematic. This Article agrees but not for the reason that most people think. The problem is not, as is commonly alleged, that these decisions are unfaithful to bedrock copyright doctrine. A closer inspection reveals that, if anything, they are in fact more faithful than their predecessors. The problem is instead that the bedrock doctrine itself is flawed. Copyright law, unlike patent law, has never shown any interest in trying to increase the predictability of its infringement test, leaving second comers to speculate as to what might or might not be allowed. But the history of music copyright offers a valuable look at a path not taken, an accidental experiment where predictability was unwittingly achieved by consistently emphasizing a single element out of a multi-element work. As a factual matter, the notion that melody is the primary locus of music's value is a fiction. As a policy matter, however, that fiction has turned out to be useful. While its original, culturally myopic rationale should be discarded, music's unidimensional test still offers underappreciated advantages over the everything counts analysis that the rest of the copyright system long ago chose.",2018,Government & Law

RESULTS Over the 10 year study period, the FDA approved 248 drugs containing one or more new molecular entities. Of these drugs, 48 (19%) had origins in publicly supported research and development and 14 (6%) originated in companies spun off from a publicly supported research program. Drugs in these groups were more likely to receive expedited FDA approval (68% v 47%, P=0.005) or be designated first in class (45% v 26%, P=0.007), indicating therapeutic importance. CONCLUSIONS A review of the patents associated with new drugs approved over the past decade indicates that publicly supported research had a major role in the late stage development of at least one in four new drugs, either through direct funding of late stage research or through spin-off companies created from public sector research institutions. These findings could have implications for policy makers in determining fair prices and revenue flows for these products.",2019,General & Internal Medicine
Is There any Blood on my Hands? Deportation as a Crime of International Law,crime against humanity; deportation; genocide; migration; ,"The present article revisits international criminal law as a tool for sanctioning the most patent abuses against migrants. Although deportation is traditionally considered as an attribute of the state inherent to its territorial sovereignty, this prerogative may degenerate into an international crime. The prohibition of deportation has been a well-established feature of international criminal law since the Nuremberg trials following the Second World War. This prohibition has been further refined over the past 15 years by an extensive jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Court. Against such a background, this article demonstrates that, in some circumstances, deportation may amount to a war crime, a crime against humanity or even a crime of genocide, depending on the factual elements of the case and the specific requirements of the relevant crime. This article accordingly reviews the constitutive elements of each crime and transposes them into the context of migration control. It highlights in turn that, although its potential has been neglected by scholars and practitioners, international criminal law has an important role to play for domesticating the state's prerogative of deportation and infusing the rule of law into the field of migration. The article concludes that there are reasonable grounds for asserting that a crime against humanity would have been committed in the Dominican Republic and Australia with regard to their deportation policy.",2016,Government & Law
"In Re: Copaxone Consol. Cases United States Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit, 2018 906 F.3d 1013 Edited for Biotechnology Law Report by CHRISTOPHER M. HOLMAN*",; MG SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTIONS; GLATIRAMER ACETATE; PILOT; COMPARE; EVERY,"A district court invalidated as obvious all of the asserted claims of the Copaxone patents, and on appeal the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit affirmed. The Copaxone patents describe and claim COPAXONE (R) 40mg/mL, a treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis wherein the active ingredient is glatiramer acetate (GA). The treatment claimed in the three patents consists of the injection of 40mg of GA three times a week. Prior to COPAXONE (R) 40mg/mL, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved COPAXONE (R) 20mg/mL, a regimen consisting of the daily injection of 20mg GA. Daily GA injections were known to subject patients to pain and discomfort at the site of injection that were reduced by switching to injecting the drug three times a week at the higher dosage, with at least a one-day break between injections. The closest prior art reference, which was one of the patent owner's own prior art published patent applications, disclosed administering 40mg GA every other day (seven times every two weeks), which the court found to be only slightly different than the regimen claimed in the Copaxone patents (six times every two weeks). Other prior art included recommendations by the FDA and others that the patent owner explore the possibility of adjusting the dosage and moving to a regimen that did not require daily injections in order to reduce patient noncompliance due to the injection site reaction, and studies showing that the 40mg dose was comparable in safety and efficacy to the 20 mg dose. The Federal Circuit held that the district court had not erred in relying on a reference that was published after the priority date and thus did not qualify as statutory prior art, noting that the court had not used the reference as invalidating prior art, but instead as evidence of a person of ordinary skill in the art's (POSITA's) motivations and expectations when reading the prior art at the time of the invention. The Federal Circuit also upheld the district court's conclusion that a 40mg GA 3x/week dosage would be obvious to try, noting that there were only two tested dosage amounts in the prior art-20mg and 40mg-and that researchers were pursuing less frequent dosing regimens, while recognizing there are a limited number of days in a week on which to test frequency. The appellate court noted that the potential for FDA approval may properly be considered in determining whether one of ordinary skill would be motivated to develop a drug product, and that FDA is more likely to approve use of a dosage that has a track record.",2019,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology
Mussa Ali v. Carnegie Institution of Washington,; ,"Pro se plaintiff, a former employee of the University of Massachusetts (UMass), sued UMass and the Carnegie Institution of Washington (Carnegie) seeking to be added as a co-inventor to multiple patents generally directed towards RNA interference (RNAi), an invention that resulted in a Nobel Prize in 2006 for two of the named co-inventors, CraigC. Mello ofUMass and Andrew Fire of Carnegie. The plaintiff also soughtmonetary damages from UMass for this alleged omission. The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed UMass based on sovereign immunity under the 11th amendment, and then transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after concluding that the Oregon court did not have personal jurisdiction over Carnegie. The DC court then dismissed the case in whole, after concluding that Carnegie would be prejudiced by UMass's absence from the case. The Federal Circuit affirmed, rejecting plaintiff's argument that UMass waived sovereign immunity when, in return for federal funding under the Bayh-Dole Act, it allegedly signed a contract controlled by and consistent with the Bayh-Dole Act and expressly declared that it would be amenable to suit in federal court. The court noted that the plaintiff could have amended his complaint to name UMass officials (to which sovereign immunity does not apply) as parties, but had failed to do so. In a concurring opinion, Judge Dyk pointed out that while ordinary property disputes between individual and state entities are resolved in state court, patent inventorship claims can only be resolved in federal court. While joining the majority opinion, Judge Dyk suggested that in a future case the court should determine how the federal joinder rules should apply to a claimfor inventorship, given the lack of any alternative remedy.",2017,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

A panel data analysis from 1998 to 2007 across 20 Italian regions identifies the primary drivers of renewable energy patenting activity. As expected, the localised stock of knowledge, local researchers and regional public research subsidies contribute significantly to the development of innovation activities. Additionally, regional characteristics, such as regional energy dependence and hydroelectric resources, are effective in determining the RET innovation patterns. Specifically, regional hydroelectric power acts as a substitute input and hence hampers the innovation activities in the field of RET. Finally, RET innovation activities depend to a limited extent on the political orientation of regional councils, thereby confirming prior research on the role of social acceptance of and political support for technology development. Highlighting the role of local resources and local policies for RET innovation activities, the present research has potential implications for economies that strive to become more self-reliant and less import intensive in the knowledge sector.",2016,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration
Mutations in the Histone Modifier PRDM6 Are Associated with Isolated Nonsyndromic Patent Ductus Arteriosus,; CONGENITAL HEART-DISEASE; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; GENES; EXPRESSION; ENDOTHELIN; FORM,"Nonsyndromic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common congenital heart defect (CHD) with both inherited and acquired causes, but the disease mechanisms have remained elusive. Using combined genome-wide linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified independent mutations in PRDM6, which encodes a nuclear protein that is specific to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), has histone methyl transferase activities, and acts as a transcriptional suppressor of contractile proteins. In vitro assays showed that the mutations cause loss of function either by intracellular redistribution of the protein and/or by alteration of its methyltransferase activities. Wild-type embryonic ductus arteriosus (DA) exhibited high levels of PRDM6, which rapidly declined postnatally as the number of VSMCs necessary for ductus contraction increased. This dynamic change suggests that PRDM6 plays a key role in maintaining VSMCs in an undifferentiated stage in order to promote their proliferation and that its loss of activity results in premature differentiation and impaired remodeling of the DA. Our findings identify PRDM6 mutations as underlying genetic causes of nonsyndromic isolated PDA in humans and implicates the wild-type protein in epigenetic regulation of ductus remodeling.",2016,Genetics & Heredity
Human Rights and Intellectual Property Protection: Their Interplay in Taiwan,Compulsory license; Copyright; Patent; Right to health; Right to information; ,"The interplay between human rights and intellectual property has been at the center of important debates in recent decades. This chapter includes three major sections to elaborate on Taiwan's efforts to implement human rights in its intellectual property regime. The first section introduces the interplay between human rights and intellectual property. Section 2 explores implementation of the right to information in copyright law. Section 3 addresses the interaction between the right to health and intellectual property protection. The chapter concludes by indicating that an over-protected IP system may be an obstacle in realizing human rights. If copyright is over-protected, it may guard the economic rights of creative intellectual activity, but its enforcement might impede access to published works for persons with print disabilities and lead to negative impacts on the right to information. In the public health field, without patents, existing medications and innovative pharmaceutical products which overcome diseases would not have been developed. Therefore, inadequate expansion and enforcement of IP protection might become a barrier to the accessibility and affordability of medications and adversely affect implementation of the right to health. For this reason, the international community pursues a proper balance between human rights and IP protection. As a member of the international community, Taiwan closely follows new developments at the international level and introduces amendments to its IP laws accordingly. Regardless of Taiwan's unique international status, it still manages to establish relevant mechanisms, consistent with international norms, in its domestic legal framework.",2019,Business & Economics

This transfer is being controlled, more and more, by the use of Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs). Therefore, the effect of MTAs on the dynamic of knowledge creation is an important concern. The aim of this research is to characterise the restrictions imposed by MTAs, and their determinants. We consider MTA diversity based on a comprehensive analysis of the clauses included in 171 MTAs signed by two French universities. We show that the clauses included in MTAs depend on several factors such as kind of material involved, research field, patenting and collection of material. We find that the presence of an industry actor is not associated to more restrictions on publication and intellectual property. We propose a typology of MTAs corresponding to different transfer situations. We discuss the role of MTAs as collaborative tools and the influence of the legal, scientific, political and organisational context.",2019,Business & Economics
A method for the detection and characterization of technology fronts: Analysis of the dynamics of technological change in 3D printing technology,; LIFE-CYCLE; MATRIX COMPOSITES; PATENT DATA; STEREOLITHOGRAPHY; FABRICATION; PARAMETERS,"This paper presents a method for the identification of the technology fronts core technological solutions underlying a certain broad technology, and the characterization of their change dynamics. We propose an approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model combined with patent data analysis and text mining techniques for the identification and dynamic characterization of the main fronts where actual technological solutions are put into practice. 3D printing technology has been selected to put our method into practice for its market emergence and multidisciplinarity. The results show two highly relevant and specialized fronts strongly related with mechanical design that evolve gradually, in our opinion acting as enabling technologies. On the other side, we detected three fronts undergoing significant changes, namely layer-by-layer multimaterial manufacturing, data processing and stereolithograpy techniques. Laser and electron-beam based technologies take shape in the latter years and show signs of becoming enabling technologies in the future. The technology fronts and data revealed by our method have been convincing to experts and coincident with many technology trends already pointed out in technical reports and scientific literature.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Although increasingly perceived as fundamental socio-economic units, the detailed fabric of urban economic activities is only recently accessible to comprehensive analyses with the availability of large datasets. Here, we study abundances of business categories across US metropolitan statistical areas, and provide a framework for measuring the intrinsic diversity of economic activities that transcends scales of the classification scheme. A universal structure common to all cities is revealed, manifesting self-similarity in internal economic structure as well as aggregated metrics (GDP, patents, crime). We present a simple mathematical derivation of the universality, and provide a model, together with its economic implications of open-ended diversity created by urbanization, for understanding the observed empirical distribution. Given the universal distribution, scaling analyses for individual business categories enable us to determine their relative abundances as a function of city size. These results shed light on the processes of economic differentiation with scale, suggesting a general structure for the growth of national economies as integrated urban systems.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics
To Increase Damages of Intellectual Property Infringement in China: A Double-Edged Sword for the Market,; ,"TRIPs Agreement encourages WTO members to enhance intellectual property (IP) protection, and developed countries have been pushing developing countries to the high level of protection of IP. However, this is not always good for the market. The damages for IP infringement increased drastically in China in recent years. This has drawn our attention to the application of the Chinese IP laws. This article analysed the rules in Chinese patent, trademark and copyright laws and their application by Chinese courts regarding damages adjudication with most updated legislative documents, statistics, important cases as well as the judicial policies of the Chinese Supreme Court. The article found that, driven by judicial policy, the courts used significant discretion to achieve increase of damages unjustifiably. This is a double edged sword for the market because, though favourable to IPR owners, it is harmful to the rule of law and it makes IP enforcement a business to misappropriate licit profit of infringer, especially in view of the emerging IP trolls. China should carry out reform to improve the legal regime of damages for IP infringement. The solution to these problems lies in resorting to the strict application of compensatory damages.",2019,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law

CONTU, as this group was known, faced the problem of choosing which ontology of software by which I mean a conception of the nature of software as an invention should serve as the conceptual underpinning for the law of software copyright. In particular, the commissioners needed to decide whether computer programs are texts, machines, means to communicate with machines, or many of these things at once. CONTU's history shows how the discursive emergence of software as a new technology has been shaped by the convergence of commercial interests, the transmission of technical knowledge to lay audiences, and idiosyncratic views on the nature of information technology and human creativity.",2016,History & Philosophy of Science
The Effects of Academic Incubators on University Innovation,incubators; patents; innovation; forward citations; licensing; BAYH-DOLE ACT; PATENT QUALITY; LIFE SCIENCES; IVORY TOWER; TECHNOLOGY; DIVERSIFICATION; RESOURCES; IMPACT; COMMERCIALIZATION; CAPABILITIES,"Research summaryIn this article, we analyze the impact of academic incubators on the quality of innovations produced by U.S. research-intensive academic institutions. We show that establishing a university-affiliated incubator is followed by a reduction in the quality of university innovations. The conclusion holds when we control for the endogeneity of the decision to establish an incubator using the presence of incubators at peer institutions as an instrument. We also document a reduction in licensing income following the establishment of an incubator. The results suggest that university incubators compete for resources with technology transfer offices and other campus programs and activities, such that the useful outputs they generate can be partially offset by reductions in innovation elsewhere. Managerial summaryDo university incubators drain resources from other university efforts to generate innovations with commercial relevance? Our analysis suggests that they do: after research-intensive U.S. universities establish incubators, the quality of university innovations, which we measure with patents, drops. This finding has immediate implications for practice, as it suggests that the benefits and costs of incubation should not be analyzed in isolation. Rather, the effects of incubators extend to the overall innovation performance of the university. It follows that measuring the net economic effect of incubators is challenging because besides the effects on innovation efforts, the presence of an incubator may attract particular kinds of faculty and students, enhance the prestige of the university, generate economic multiplier effects, and benefit the community as a whole.

The Political Foundations of TRIPS Revisited,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; FREE-TRADE AGREEMENTS; PATENT PROTECTION; PLUS AGREEMENTS; ACCESS; DECLARATION; GOVERNANCE; POLICY,"The contribution revisits the political foundations of the TRIPS Agreement with a view to determine its role and functioning under the changed socio-economic geopolitical conditions of today's world economic order. The Agreement, which was concluded as part of and under the pressure of the GATT/WTO trade package, provides for internationally uniform standards of adequate protection of intellectual property in all States Members of the WTO, regardless of the differences of their economic development, industrial structures and social needs. As a global deep trade agreement, which governs not only cross border trade, but Members' internal markets, it raises issues both of its compatibility with the principle of comparative advantage underlying international trade, and of the legitimacy of its interfering with domestic market regulation. The flexibilities, which have been built into the TRIPS Agreement, may mitigate concerns. However, the growing new biand pluri-lateralism of regional free trade agreements with their asymmetric intellectual property rules, the re-distribution of economic power among the developed and the emerging or rather the emerged countries, and the nature of strategic competition between globally acting multinational corporations have changed the rules of the game. The task ahead is to re-conceptualize the TRIPS Agreement as a framework regulation for national innovation markets, which at the same time are integrated into global markets to varying degrees. As such, it would form part of an open international economic law, which, in its turn, needs to be developed in order to overcome the rigid and already fading paradigms of international trade law. Only such a vision will help to accommodate intellectual property protection with the large diversity of industrial policies and with the many intellectual property-related public interests and policies, which WTO Members may or do adhere to.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law

Both the role and the effectiveness of these policy instruments in sustaining tenants' performances are still open issues. We rely on unique Italian data and compare the performance of firms located within a park with a control sample of off-park firms. Firstly, we focus on the estimation of the treatment effect of being located within the park. Our results show a significant difference between on and off park firms with respect to their innovativeness and propensity to invest in R & D; to the contrary, firms' growth appears unaffected by location effects. Secondly, we analyse what features of Science Parks drive the impact on the diverse measures of performance. Our main finding is that both patenting activity and R&D investments are actively sustained by the presence and quantity of research centres within the park. Growth remains a largely unexplained phenomenon and Gibrat law is found to hold robustly within the class of on-park firms.",2017,Engineering; Business & Economics

The study period from 2000 to 2013 has been characterized by a rapid growth in industry's R&D expenditures, as part of the strategic shift, induced by the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005. Using the real financial data for the top 91 publicly listed Indian domestic pharmaceutical companies, the study provides new evidence on drivers of R&D intensity in Indian Drugs and Pharmaceutical industry. A panel data random effects Tobit model along with OLS model using firm fixed effects are applied to identify the factors affecting the R&D intensity of the sample firms. Furthermore, McDonald and Moffitt in Rev Econ Stat 62(2):318-321, (1980) procedure is used to decompose Tobit estimates. The empirical findings of the study reveal that firm's size, past year profitability, past innovative output, leverage ratio; past cash flow; export and import intensities of the firm tend to significantly impact the R&D intensity. While firm size exhibits a non-linear relationship, cash flow, past innovative output shows a positive and significant relationship with R&D intensity. Further, patent count and firm's overseas presence, considered as additional important determinants of firm-level R&D intensity, influences R&D positively. Lastly, global orientation of Indian pharmaceutical firms has been found to impact R&D activities considerably.",2018,Business & Economics
Biosimilars: considerations in light of the Italian legal framework,Advertising; biosimilars; competition; Italy; public tenders; scientific information; ,"Biological and biotechnological medicines are important pharmaceutical innovations due to their influence on the treatment of many conditions and because they have led the way in devising new and innovative pharmacological therapies. In addition, biosimilars, which can be authorized on the date of expiry of a biological originator's patent, give an opportunity for the sustainability of national healthcare services. This paper explores aspects of Italy's 2017 Budget Law that emerged following a heated debate on legal doctrine and jurisprudence about biosimilars, the automatic substitutability between biological and biosimilar products, the purchasing processes of such medicines, and also on physician's freedom of prescription. This Law encourages the widespread adoption and use of biosimilar products, which is pivotal to making these next-generation medicines more economically viable for use in hospitals. It also sets out some principles that define the regulatory framework that always ensures the physician's freedom of prescription is a priority, as is patients' safety and protection.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
"The More Things Change: Improvement Patents, Drug Modifications, and the FDA",; COMPARATIVE EFFICACY; UNITED-STATES; VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM; PRICE-COMPETITION; BRAND LOYALTY; HEALTH; INNOVATION; INFORMATION; COST; PROMOTION,"Pharmaceutical companies often replace prescription drugs that are already on the market with modified versions that have the same active pharmaceutical ingredient. On the surface, such activity seems benign and perhaps even salutary. Nonetheless, antitrust litigation has revealed that firms sometimes modify existing drugs not because new formulations would demonstrably improve health outcomes, but principally because so-called secondary patents covering the new version of the drug enable them to maintain some effective market power over the active ingredient for which original, primary patent protection has expired. This product hopping strategy runs counter to the goal of the legislative framework for regulating branded and generic drug approvals, which is to create appropriate incentives for discoveries that elevate the quality of patient care and human health by providing a period of reward for the brand followed by timely and effectual generic entry. In this Article, I explain that the rules and institutions involved in determining the validity of patents on chemical inventions, certain features of drug regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and unique market forces in the pharmaceutical sector combine to allow strategic product hopping. To address this problem, I propose a novel regulatory scheme that would empower the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to induce pharmaceutical companies to generate comparative data indicative of therapeutic distinctiveness between related forms of small-molecule drugs. I explain that the FDA is institutionally well-positioned to serve as an information intermediary that can help increase transparency with respect to drug changes, and show that the relevant disclosures can be presented in a manner that is useful to patients, prescribers, and payers. The proposed framework would then enable these market participants to identify and reject strategic drug product changes, reducing the manufacturer's incentive to pursue such modifications. Ultimately, the FDA's new authority for comparative data development could lead to improvements in patient care and promote downstream clinical research based on scientific evidence gathered under the directives of the proposed scheme.",2019,Government & Law

In this paper the underlying thermodynamics principles of equilibrium, detailed balance, and conservation laws are presented for zero-point energy extraction. The proposed methods are separated into three classes: nonlinear processing of the zero-point field, mechanical extraction using Casimir cavities, and the pumping of atoms through Casimir cavities. The first two approaches are shown to violate thermodynamics principles, and therefore appear not to be feasible, no matter how innovative their execution. The third approach, based upon stochastic electrodynamics, does not appear to violate these principles, but may face other obstacles.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of co-inventor networks in a small but thriving OECD economy in Latin America: Chile. Using a dataset for patents granted in the country between 1989 and 2018, we study a variety of statistical properties for five different co-inventor networks. We show that these networks exhibit power-law, small-world, and preferential attachment properties, all of which have been used to describe networks in more advanced economies. We also highlight some apparent differences in collaboration patterns between networks (and inventors) and we reveal the precarious nature of the network of local inventors by confirming the community structure property. Evidence for strong positive autocorrelation between highly and lowly productive inventors is presented via methods used in spatial econometrics. Our results show that the inventor system in Chile is highly fragmented, which emphasizes the need for strong government intervention in steering research funding, and for more collaboration between inventors, especially local ones.

The effectiveness of policies for formal knowledge transfer from European universities and public research institutes to firms,technology transfer; institutional policies; university by-laws; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER OFFICES; INDUSTRY; IMPACT; COMMERCIALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; INCENTIVES; TYPOLOGY,"We use survey data for 247 European universities and 40 public research organizations to investigate the effects of institutional policies on four outcomes of transfer performance (R&D agreements with companies, patent applications, licence agreements, and start-ups established). We find that the effects of policies to establish clear rules, improve transparency, and provide financial or non-financial incentives vary by outcome. Improving transparency by publishing the policies for licencing or intellectual property are often negatively correlated with outcomes, particularly for licence agreements. Out of three non-financial incentives, only social rewards have a rather positive effect (on start-ups), but financial incentives are positively correlated with several outcomes. A higher salary is positively linked to the number of research agreements and patent applications, while giving inventors a share of revenue is positively correlated with licencing and start-ups. The results suggest that the type of incentive as well as the degree of transparency of transfer policies should be chosen to complement the main transfer channels and strategy of the institution.",2015,Information Science & Library Science
Narrowing the Gaps in Global Disputes: the Case of Counterfeits in Kenya,Path dependence; Intellectual property rights; Kenya; Counterfeit; ANTIMALARIAL-DRUG QUALITY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; PATH DEPENDENCE; AFRICA; MEDICINES; POLITICS; PATENTS; ACCESS,"This article investigates the nature and potential trajectories of global disputes. Conventional accounts of global disputes often see them as inherently open-ended so that actors can always roll back previous defeats; alternatively, path-dependent accounts emphasize the likelihood of those who prevail in early struggles to reproduce their advantaged position. Like path-dependent accounts, I argue that disputes are nested, so that the goals and possible outcomes of new disputes are bounded by the results of earlier disputes-but rather than enlarging the gap between the parties to the dispute by reproducing advantages, nested disputes, on the contrary, lead to the narrowing of positions and to lower stakes. I illustrate this argument by describing two constitutive moments in the debate over intellectual property rights in Kenya: first, the debate around the Industrial Property Act over the exceptions to intellectual property rights; second, the debate around the Anti-Counterfeit Act over whether anti-counterfeit measures should apply to medicines.",2015,Development Studies; International Relations; Government & Law

Receiving malaria case management training (adjusted odds ratio [aOR])=2.3; CI=1.4 - 3.7) and having good knowledge of malaria treatment (aOR=4.0; CI=2.4 - 6.7) were associated with PFA.ConclusionsOverall preference for ACT use was low among health care providers in this study. Preference for ACTs and proportion of health workers with good knowledge of malaria case management were even lower among PPMVs who had highest proportion of those who received malaria case management training. We recommend evaluation of current training quality, enhanced targeted training, follow-up supportive supervision of PPMVs and behavior change communication on ACT use.",2019,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

A science system is a progressive business where research builds upon diverse existing research and knowledge. The extent of research utilization is determined by the extent to which prior research can feed into research that ultimately leads to acts of use. We use the term 'knowledge transformers' to refer to research users that transform academic knowledge into the socio-economic domain, and define 'usability' of prior research as the ease with which it may contribute to research that knowledge transformers are able to absorb. We argue that total societal benefit from science is ultimately dependent on the extent to which newly created scientific knowledge is cognate with knowledge transformers' knowledge. More consideration is needed of the processes by which research creates usable knowledge in different kinds of research practices.",2018,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration
AGAINST INTOLERANCE: THE RED SCARE ROOTS OF LEGAL LIBERALISM,; ADMINISTRATIVE-LAW; FREEDOM; SPEECH; LABOR,"This article argues that important antecedents of post-New Deal American liberalism emerged in response to the First Red Scare. As war hysteria gave way to patent antiradicalism, the pervasiveness of peacetime state-sponsored repression undermined progressive confidence in administrative governance and generated support for so-called personal rights. At the same time, the suppression of meaningful labor activity during the early 1920s buttressed conservative confidence in the judiciary and emboldened lawyers and business advocates to oppose state policing of putatively private beliefs. The result was increasing convergence around a new liberalism, defined against intolerance, which laid the groundwork for judicial enforcement of free speech and minority rights.",2019,History
"MACHINES AS THE NEW OOMPA-LOOMPAS: TRADE SECRECY, THE CLOUD, MACHINE LEARNING, AND AUTOMATION",; COPYRIGHT; LAW; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; PATENT; PROTECTION; CONTRACT; STANDARD; HISTORY; FUTURE,"In previous work, I wrote about how trade secrecy drives the plot of Roald Dahl's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, explaining how the Oompa-Loompas are the ideal solution to Willy Wonka's competitive problems. Since publishing that piece I have been struck by the proliferating Oompa-Loompas in contemporary life: computing machines filled with software and fed on data. These computers, software, and data might not look like Oompa-Loompas, but they function as Wonka's tribe does: holding their secrets tightly and internally for the businesses for which these machines are deployed. Computing machines were not always such effective secret-keeping Oompa Loompas. As this Article describes, at least three recent shifts in the computing industry-cloud computing, the increasing primacy of data and machine learning, and automation-have turned these machines into the new Oompa-Loompas. While new technologies enabled this shift, trade secret law has played an important role here as well. Like other intellectual property rights, trade secret law has a body of built-in limitations to ensure that the incentives offered by the law's protection do not become so great that they harm follow-on innovation-new innovation that builds on existing innovation-and competition. This Article argues that, in light of the technological shifts in computing, the incentives that trade secret law currently provides to develop these contemporary Oompa-Loompas are excessive in relation to their worrisome effects on follow-on innovation and competition by others. These technological shifts allow businesses to circumvent trade secret law's central limitations, thereby overfortifying trade secrecy protection. The Article then addresses how trade secret law might be changed- by removing or diminishing its protection-to restore balance for the good of both competition and innovation.",2019,Government & Law

Atrial septal aneurysm with rare comorbid pulmonary arteriovenous malformation as aetiology for cryptogenic stroke,cardiovascular medicine; neurology; stroke; medical management; ,"Atrial septal aneurysms have two mechanisms for cardioembolic events. One is the aneurysm itself can act as a nidus for thrombus formation in the left atrium. The aneurysm creates an area of low turbulence leading to haemostasis allowing fibrin-platelet adhesions to form. If the clot is on the left atrial wall, it may be dislodged by oscillations of the septum and travel into the systemic circulation. The second mechanism is via, an often comorbid, interatrial shunt such as a Patent Foramen Ovale or Atrial Septal Defect. We report a unique case where the associated right to left shunt leading to the cryptogenic stroke is a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.",2019,General & Internal Medicine
The Strategic Implications of Scale in Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis,conjoint analysis; market research; choice models; scale; MINIMUM DIFFERENTIATION; PRICE-COMPETITION; PRODUCT; EXISTENCE; PRINCIPLE,"Choice-based conjoint (CBC) studies have begun to rely on simulators to forecast equilibrium prices for pricing, strategic product positioning, and patent/copyright valuations. Whereas CBC research has long focused on the accuracy of estimated relative partworths of attribute levels, predicted equilibrium prices and strategic positioning are surprisingly and dramatically dependent on scale: the magnitude of the partworths (including the price coefficient) relative to the magnitude of the error term. Although the impact of scale on the ability to estimate heterogeneous partworths is well known, neither the literature nor current practice address the sensitivity of pricing and positioning to scale. This sensitivity is important because (estimated) scale depends on seemingly innocuous market-research decisions such as whether attributes are described by text or by realistic images. We demonstrate the strategic implications of scale using a stylized model in which heterogeneity is modeled explicitly. If a firm shirks on the quality of a CBC study and acts on incorrectly observed scale, a follower, but not an innovator, can make costly strategic errors. Externally valid estimates of scale are extremely important. We demonstrate empirically that image realism and incentive alignment affect scale sufficiently to change strategic decisions and affect patent/copyright valuations by hundreds of millions of dollars.",2019,Business & Economics

There are reviews about the mechanisms responsible for its effects in leukemia and lymphomas, emphasizing the chemosensitizing role of resveratrol, which allows overcoming the multidrug resistance of cancers. The action of resveratrol occurs preferentially on leukemic cells, and not on the normal ones. In addition, it is one of the few drugs that act on leukemic stem cells. If experimental results are promising, its application in humans encounters some difficulties. The paper presents the causes of its low bioavailability, as well as recent patents that allow improvement of its bioavailability, development of new extraction procedures, obtaining new formulae, and associating resveratrol with other drugs in order to increase its effects.

Barrow Innovation Center Case Series: Early Clinical Experience with Novel Surgical Instrument Used To Prevent lntraoperative Spinal Cord Injuries,latrogenic injury; Innovation; Resident education; Spinal cord injury; PEDICLE SCREW FIXATION; COMPLICATIONS,"OBJECTIVE: The Barrow Innovation Center comprises an educational program in medical innovation that enables residents to identify problems in patient care and rapidly develop and implement solutions to these problems. Residents involved in this program noted an elevated risk of iatrogenic spinal cord injury during posterior cervical and thoracic procedures. The objective of this study was to describe this complication, and a novel solution was developed through a new innovation training program. METHODS: A case report demonstrates the risk of iatrogenic spinal cord injury during posterior cervical decompression and fusion. Solutions to this problem were developed at the innovation center via an iterative process of prototype creation, cadaveric testing, and redesign. Patent law students who partnered with the center wrote and filed a provisional patent protecting the novel prototype designs. RESULTS: The concept of a protective shield for the spinal cord was developed, and within only 6 weeks the devices were provisionally patented and used in the operating room. This device was named the Myeloshield. Initial clinical experience indicates that the Myeloshield can be used without impeding the flow of surgery and has the potential to prevent iatrogenic spinal cord injury; this experience is presented through 2 case reports demonstrating the use of Myeloshields in the operating room. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates how programs like the Barrow Innovation Center can provide neurosurgery residents with a unique educational experience in medical device innovation and intellectual property development and can serve as an avenue of surgical quality improvement and problem solving.",2018,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery

The primary aim of this study is to explore how intra-regional economies interact with host countries' innovative performance, and how they are affected by FDI. Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, located in the South Caucasus region, are selected as examples. Numbers of patent applications, R&D expenditure (% of GDP), and intellectual property payments are chosen as factors indicative of innovation. While this research tries to explore whether these three countries, connected by large trades, can act as a clustered group, panel cointegration and panel OLS models are used for analysis. The results show that FDI is an important variable affecting the level of innovation in the panel analysis. Nevertheless, individual relationships with FDI vary, and cointegration analysis shows heterogeneity. That is, foreign direct investment could play a central role in increasing the level of innovation for Azerbaijan and Georgia, but it is not an important determinant of Turkey's economic innovation level. Countries should realize that when their economies are becoming stronger FDI is not a useful tool for escalating innovation, rather they should cluster together in order to leverage innovation.",2017,Government & Law

It posits that immigrants (emigrants) act as a transnational knowledge bridge between the host (home) regions and their origin (destination) countries, thus facilitating their co-inventorship networks. It also argues that the social capital of both the hosting and the moving communities reinforces such a bridging role, along with language commonality and migrants' human capital. Focusing on Spain, as a country that hosted an intense process of migration over the past two decades, patent data are combined with national data on residents and electors abroad and a gravity model is applied to the co-inventorship between Spanish provinces (NUTS-3 regions) and a number of foreign countries. Both immigrants and emigrants affect the kind of innovation networking at stake. The social capital of both the moving and the hosting communities actually moderates this impact positively. The effect of migration is stronger for more skilled migrants and with respect to non-Spanish-speaking countries, pointing to a language-bridging role of migrants. Policy implications are drawn accordingly.",2019,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration

The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 was enacted to support university research efforts. However, since its enactment, university technological innovation had been increasing slowly. This study applies the Technology, Organisation, and Environment framework to explore the current and future impact of university characteristics and regional industry R&D activities on university technological innovation and commercialisation. The study addresses three research gaps in the literature: (1) It investigates university and regional characteristics at the same time, (2) it includes both current and future impact on university innovation outcomes, and (3) it provides a timely update to fairly dated literature on the topic, using extensive quantitative analyses that differ from previous studies. The findings verify existing, albeit fairly dated, literature by demonstrating the positive impact of university characteristics and regional R&D activities; and extend the literature by showing their future impact to various degrees. The intricacies of the coefficients of impact enrich our understanding of how these drivers can be leveraged to boost university innovation outcomes.

A New Deference Standard: The Rebuttable Presumption of Validity for USPTO Trademark Likelihood-of-Confusion Determinations,; ,"Circuit courts are split on how much deference should be given to a United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) trademark likelihood-of-confusion determination during litigation under Lanham Act section 43(a)(1)(A). While some courts afford a substantial amount of deference to the USPTO's findings regarding a likelihood of confusion when it refuses to register a mark on the principal register, other courts afford little to no deference to the USPTO's findings regarding a likelihood of confusion. This disparity among courts outlines a need for a solution that best fulfills the goals of the various courts in order to create a unified precedent of deference. By analyzing each court's approach as to how much deference to give and by taking a closer look into the deference given to USPTO patent determinations, this Note proposes that USPTO likelihood-of-confusion determinations receive a presumption of validity in subsequent litigation. A challenger can rebut this when CO a USPTO examiner failed to consider or was unaware of relevant evidence; (2) an examiner's actions were arbitrary and capricious; or (3) there exists evidence of unfair prejudice. This solution better fulfills efficiency than reasonable alternatives, and in an overarching effort to create homogeny, better creates a uniform precedent of deference.",2017,Government & Law

However, there is a paucity of such studies in other geographical domains. Existing studies have further not focused on examining the simultaneous effects on entrepreneurial and innovative outcomes of university focused technology transfer policies. We address these research gaps by examining the effects of a far-reaching legislation change in Germany, reforming the old 'professor's privilege' (Hochschullehrerprivileg). The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether regional entrepreneurial and innovative outcomes have been affected by this legislative change in intellectual property rights of inventions made by scientists. Our results suggest that this legislative change did have an initial positive effect on universities as measured by start-ups and patents. The effect yet changed over time, leading to some unintended consequences. Our paper argues that policy makers and legislators need to give consideration to the replication of policy and legislative instruments from other contexts along with the criteria that are used to measure success.",2019,Engineering; Business & Economics
PRODUCT HOPPING: A NEW FRAMEWORK,; HATCH-WAXMAN ACT; EXCLUSIONARY CONDUCT; COMPETITION; DEFINITION; ANTITRUST; CONSUMERS; ENTRY; DRUGS,"One of the most misunderstood and anticompetitive business behaviors in today's economy is product hopping, which occurs when a brand-name pharmaceutical company switches from one version of a drug to another. These switches, benign in appearance but not necessarily in effect, can significantly decrease consumer welfare, impairing competition from generic drugs to an extent that greatly exceeds any gains from the improved branded product. The antitrust analysis of product hopping is nuanced. It implicates the intersection of antitrust law, patent law, the Hatch-Waxman Act, and state drug product selection laws. In fact, the behavior is even more complex because it occurs in uniquely complicated markets characterized by doctors who choose the product but don't pay for it, and consumers who buy the product but don't choose it. It is thus unsurprising that courts have offered inconsistent approaches to product hopping. They have paid varying levels of attention to the regulatory structure, offered a simplistic analysis of consumer choice, adopted an underinclusive antitrust standard based on coercion, and focused on, whether the brand firm removed the original drug from the market. Entering this morass, we offer a new framework that courts, government enforcers, plaintiffs, and manufacturers can employ to analyze product hopping. This rigorous and balanced framework is the first to incorporate the economic characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry. For starters, it defines a product hop to include only those instances in which the brand manufacturer (1) reformulates the product in a way that makes the generic non-substitutable and (2) encourages doctors to write prescriptions for the reformulated product rather than the original. The test also offers two safe harbors, which are more deferential than current caselaw, to ensure that the vast majority of reformulations will not be subject to antitrust scrutiny. The analysis then examines whether a brand's product hop passes the no-economic-sense test. In other words, would the reformulation make economic sense for the brand if it did not have the effect of impairing generic competition? Merely introducing new products would pass the test. Encouraging doctors to write prescriptions for the reformulated rather than the original product cannibalizing the brand's own sales might not. Imposing antitrust liability on behavior that does not make business sense other than through its impairment of generic competition offers a conservative approach and minimizes false positives in which courts erroneously find liability. Showing just how far the courts have veered from justified economic analysis, the test would recommend a different analysis than that used in each of the five product-hopping cases that have been litigated to date, and a different outcome in two of them. By carefully considering the regulatory environment, practicalities of prescription drug markets, manufacturers' desire for clear-cut rules, and consumers' needs for a rule that promotes price competition without deterring valued innovations, the framework promises to improve and standardize the antitrust analysis of product hopping.",2016,Government & Law
ANTI-INNOVATION NORMS,; RATIONAL DECISION-MAKING; SOCIAL NORMS; BIOMEDICAL-RESEARCH; CONFIRMATION BIAS; LAW; ECONOMICS; PATENTS; TECHNOLOGY; BUSINESS; CULTURE,"Intellectual property (IP) scholars have recently turned their attention to social norms-informal rules that emerge from and are enforced by nonhierarchically organized social forces-as a promising way to spur innovation in communities as diverse as the fashion industry and the open-source software movement. The narrative that has emerged celebrates social norms' ability to solve IP's free-rider problem without incurring IP's costs. But this account does not fully consider the dark side of social norms. In fact, certain social norms, when overenforced, can create substantial barriers to the most socially beneficial creative pursuits. Because IP scholars have left unexplored how social norms can hinder innovation in this way, the harm they cause has gone unmitigated. This Article sheds light on the dark side of innovation norms. It coins the term anti-innovation norms to label these counterproductive social forces. Using the double lens of sociology and psychology, it gives a full theoretical account of three types of anti-innovation norms: research priority, methodology, and evaluation norms-all of which interfere with socially beneficial boundary-crossing innovation. Our elucidation of anti-innovation norms has both theoretical and policy implications. On the theory side, it suggests that IP scholars to date have been too focused on addressing the free-rider problem. This has caused them to overlook other barriers to innovation, like those posed by the set of anti-innovation norms we describe here. This focus on free riding may also help explain why innovation and norms scholars have paid little attention to debates within the broader literature on law and social norms concerned with identifying situations in which social norms are welfare reducing. On the policy side, it points to innovation dilemmas that IP is not fully equipped to solve. While changes to the IP doctrines of attribution and fair use in copyright and nonobviousness in patent law can counteract anti-innovation norms at the margin, a comprehensive solution requires innovation scholars to broaden their vision beyond the IP toolkit. We take the first steps in this direction, proposing a number of interventions, including novel funding regimes and tax credits.",2018,Government & Law
INNOVATING CRIMINAL JUSTICE,; PATENTS; LAW,"From secret stingray devices that can pinpoint a suspect's location, to advanced forensic DNA-analysis tools, to recidivism risk statistic software-the use of privately developed criminal justice technologies is growing. So too is a concomitant pattern of trade secret assertion surrounding these technologies. This Article charts the role of private law secrecy in shielding criminal justice activities, demonstrating that such secrecy is pervasive, problematic, and ultimately unnecessary for the production of well-designed criminal justice tools. This Article makes three contributions to the existing literature. First, the Article establishes that trade secrecy now permeates American criminal justice, shielding privately developed criminal justice technologies from vigorous cross-examination and review. Second, the Article argues that private law secrecy surrounding the inner workings-or even the existence-of these criminal justice technologies imposes potentially unconstitutional harms on individual defendants and significant practical harms on both the criminal justice system and the development of well-designed criminal justice technology. Third, the Article brings the extensive literature on innovation policy to bear on the production of privately developed criminal justice technologies, demonstrating that trade secrecy is not essential to either the existence or operation of those technologies. The Article proposes alternative innovation policies that the government, as both a funder of research and the primary purchaser of criminal justice technologies, is uniquely well-positioned to implement.",2018,Government & Law
"How Public Is the Public Domain? The Perpetual Protection of Inventions, Designs and Works by Trademarks",; LAW,"There are plenty of trademarks consisting of product shapes that effectively deter competition, although the original work or the invention giving the shape to the product (and to the trademark) is already in the public domain and should be free to be used by anyone. Trademark laws typically contain provisions declaring certain kinds of trademarks not protectable on the basis of absolute grounds for refusal. However, the legal practice reveals that these mechanisms within the trademark laws are not sufficient to safeguard the public domain. Companies frequently try to deter free competition by registering trademarks consisting of the shape of a product after they lose the exclusivity in the patent, industrial design or work that gave its value to the product and meanwhile belongs to the public domain. This problem occurs in particular in relation to popular inventions, but also to designs or characters of works that are of high commercial value. Not only in developing countries, courts seem to hesitate assessing an invention, design or work to be part of the public domain if the popularity and value of the product are significant. The most appropriate approach to solve this problem is to introduce an international mandatory regulation that overarches all intellectual property rights and explicitly safeguards the public domain. Such general principle in international law should particularly ensure that the free use of inventions, designs or works is not affected by trademarks once the underlying intellectual property right expires.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law

Enter the lowly paper shredder, a machine that proliferates waste and serves as the repository of carefully guarded secrets and confidential records, even as it is designed to eliminate the dregs of bureaucratic culture. Until recently, in the United States as elsewhere, paper was the medium of official state law. The 20th-century rise of the paper shredder and its paper trail, as we shall see, thus reveals the material, cultural and economic entanglement of written law with destruction and consumption, security, and privacy, not only in the U.S., it turns out, but worldwide. The trail leads from formal recognition of the paper shredder in a 1909 U.S. patent to its actual manufacture and development as a business machine in Germany twenty-five or so years later, from the shredder's role in defining political moments to its appearance in cartoons that confuse it with fax machines or legal counsel, and from regulations governing the disposition of records to industrywide 'certificates of destruction' that ensure against the dangers of snoopy dumpster divers.",2019,Cultural Studies
Legal and Ethnoecological Components of Bioprospecting,; GENETIC-RESOURCES,"Innovation in the use of biological material has surged ahead over the past decades, closely followed by additions and amendments to the regulatory environment. The aim of this chapter is to explore the most important legal tools relating to the use of genetic resources and to identify the significant changes and additions. This article looks at the critical aspects for a successful implementation of the Nagoya Protocol. Three topics are especially covered: the need for (a) developing sound access and benefit sharing (ABS) contracts; (b) establishing provider and user legislation or regulation in all countries; and (c) avoiding fragmentation at the international legal level concerning ABS. The regulatory environment is increasingly focused on strengthening intellectual property rights (patents and plant breeders' rights) and access to and sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources in terms of ABS. Whereas the regulation of use depends on the laws enacted in each country where bioprospecting occurs, the international arena has become increasingly important for law-making in the last 30 years.

Access to hepatitis C virus treatment: Lessons from implementation of strategies for increasing access to antiretroviral treatment,Acces to medicines; Hepatitis C virus; HIV; Antiretrovirals; Direct-acting antivirals; HIV RESPONSE,"At September's 2017 United Nations General Assembly, a state-of-the-art HIV medicine was announced to be made available at just $75 per person per year. There have been a number of strategies that the global AIDS community and countries have utilized to reduce prices and make antiretrovirals (ARVs) accessible for people living with HIV/AIDS. There appears to be an opportunity for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to benefit from the often painful and laboured history of driving down the prices of ARVs. In general, the success of lowering prices for ARVs has stemmed from the politics needed to initially support generic entry into the on-patent market. The use of flexibilities present in the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) have been used to overcome patent barriers, with the use of compulsory licenses and/or the threat of their use as instruments for strengthening the bargaining power in price negotiations. These strategies have been combined with new financing mechanisms that have promoted more effective procurement and price negotiations. Partnership among the different stakeholders has also been critical in this regard. Countries have also invested in their health systems and implemented several strategies to reduce stigma and discrimination to increase access to and improve utilization of ARVs. This article suggests that any future international initiatives to increase access to DAAs can learn from these lessons surrounding price reduction, improved financing, advocacy, as well as health systems strengthening and stigma reduction. Adopting and reconfiguring these strategies will also incur substantial savings in time, money and lives.

Using simulation experiments to test historical explanations: the development of the German dye industry 1857-1913,Simulation experiment; Historical development; Dye industry; Industrial development; University education; Patent law; COEVOLUTION; PATH,"In a simulation experiment, building on the abductive simulation approach of Brenner and Werker (2007), we test historical explanations for why German firms came to surpass British and France firms and to dominate the global synthetic dye industry for three decades before World War 1 while the U.S. never achieved large market share despite large home demand. Murmann and Homburg (J Evol Econ 11(2):177-205, 2001) and Murmann (2003) argued that German firms came to dominate the global industry because of (1) the high initial number of chemists in Germany at the start of the industry in 1857, (2) the high responsiveness of the German university system and (3) the late (1877) introduction of a patent regime in Germany as well as the more narrow construction of this regime compared to Britain, France and the U.S. We test the validity of these three potential explanations with the help of simulation experiments. The experiments show that the 2nd explanation-the high responsiveness of the German university system- is the most compelling one because unlike the other two it is true for virtually all plausible historical settings.",2016,Business & Economics
"THE MEANING OF FRAND, PART II: INJUNCTIONS",; STANDARD-ESSENTIAL PATENTS; GOOD FAITH; CONTRACT; LAW; INFRINGEMENT; HOLDUP; POLICY,"Under what conditions may the holder of standard-essential patents (SEPs) seek to enjoin an infringing implementer without breaching the SEP holder's contract with the standard-setting organization (SSO) to provide access to those SEPs on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms? I show that the SEP holder's contractual obligations still permit it to seek an injunction. A FRAND commitment requires the SEP holder to offer a license for the SEPs on FRAND terms (or otherwise to grant implementers access to the SEPs). Extending an offer containing a price within the FRAND range discharges the SEP holder's contractual obligation. Thereafter, the SEP holder may seek to enjoin an implementer that has rejected a FRAND offer. This analysis indicates the imprudence of categorically banning injunctions for the infringement of SEPs, as some scholars have advocated and as one of the world's most significant SSOs-the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)-actually did in 2015 in amendments to its bylaws. Such a ban would invite opportunism by implementers and is unnecessary. Courts already can prevent opportunism by SEP holders by conditioning an injunction on the implementer's actual or constructive rejection of a FRAND offer.",2015,Business & Economics; Government & Law

Innovations diffuse through segmented networks of knowledge that limit the flow of knowledge from any one technological domain to any other. Despite this segmentation, some organizations are capable of developing pieces of knowledge that overcome these limitations. Within this context, we develop four hypotheses regarding specific R&D strategies that affect a firm's ability to develop inventions that diffuse beyond the firm's technological boundaries. Specifically, we examine how a fur's scientific intensity, technological collaborations, technological diversity, and internal focus impact breadth of innovation diffusion. We use two of the main determinants of innovation diffusion, namely, the relative advantage and the observability, as theoretical mechanisms to build our arguments. We empirically test our hypotheses on longitudinal data from the industries of pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and chemicals. Our findings show that the extent to which the knowledge embedded in a firm's inventions diffuses in distant technological areas is positively related to the firm's scientific intensity and to its extent of collaboration, but it is negatively related to its technological diversity.",2018,Business & Economics
EXCESSIVE PRICING OF OFF-PATENT PHARMACEUTICALS: HATCH IT OR RATCHET?,; INDUSTRY; DRUGS,"There is growing concern over the pharmaceutical industry's ability to set and raise drug prices as it sees fit. The price of a drug that has not been protected by a patent for decades can suddenly increase-or ratchet-as much as 10,000%. This Note identifies the problem of ratcheting drug prices and considers whether these abrupt changes in drug prices derive from a longstanding problem inherent in the United States' pharmaceutical regulatory regime. It then considers the most commonly suggested mechanism for countering high drug prices-stimulating competition in the pharmaceutical market-but ultimately concludes that focusing solely on increasing competition constructs an overly simplistic view of ratcheting drug prices. In order to find an effective solution to unexpected increases in drug prices, this Note evaluates a small subset of pharmaceuticals that have recently undergone a sudden price increase and separates the ratcheting events into two categories: (1) those that occur as a result of natural deviations in the market, and (2) those that occur due to business tactics that take advantage of vulnerabilities in the drug market. It concludes that under this categorization, antitrust law may provide an effective solution specifically directed at ratcheting events of the second category-those driven by anticompetitive behavior.",2017,Government & Law

To do so, I develop and validate two measures of firms' reliance on trade secrecy: one based on 10-K disclosures and one based on subsequent litigation outcomes. I complement these measures by using the staggered passage of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act as a shock to trade secrecy. I find that firms that begin to rely more heavily on trade secrecy substitute increased voluntary disclosure of nonproprietary information for decreased disclosure of proprietary information. The total effect of trade secrecy is a decrease in corporate transparency.",2018,Business & Economics
REGISTERING DISAGREEMENT: REGISTRATION IN MODERN AMERICAN TRADEMARK LAW,; PUBLIC-INTEREST; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PATENT OFFICE; MARKS; INCONTESTABILITY; INFRINGEMENT; COMPETITION; CONFUSION; DEATH; NAMES,"Trademark scholars widely agree that our current system for evaluating what rights a trademark owner should have over others' uses of their (or similar) marks is broken. Courts too readily find too many acts to be infringing even when they're harmless or. actually useful to consumers. Trademark practitioners, meanwhile, while often quite approving of broad interpretations of trademark law, widely recognize that our trademark registration system has significant practical problems. What we haven't done is try to unite concerns over the expansion of trademark rights with concerns over the registration system, and explain their relationship to each other. Registration offers some of the most challenging puzzles in trademark law. Consider: If the mark REDSKINS for a football team is disparaging and its trademark registration therefore invalid, can trademark law nonetheless protect the team against unauthorized uses of the term? This question became more than theoretical when a district court recently upheld the invalidation of the REDSKINS registrations, a ruling now on appeal and likely headed to the Supreme Court. Or suppose the PTO determines that, in the abstract, an applied-for trademark is likely to cause confusion with another previously registered mark. If the applicant decides to use the mark anyway, without a registration, should the PTO's determination bind a federal court asked to determine whether the new mark, as actually used, causes confusion with that previously registered mark? The Supreme Court just decided this issue in a way that generated large-scale uncertainty about the new relationship between registration and infringement liability. These questions, and a number of others, highlight the need for renewed attention to trademark registration as such. Registration provides opportunities to limit trademark's current structurelessness. Specifically, registration works best in a system that doesn't aim to search out and extirpate every possible instance of confusion, instead recognizing multiple reasons that we might avoid fact-intensive confusion inquiries and either ban or allow certain market behaviors. Moreover, maintaining the registration system requires the investment of substantial government and private resources, which is currently almost irrelevant at the enforcement stage. Applicants and the PTO spend much time and effort crafting the equivalent of an exquisitely detailed origami crane; rather than considering the details, courts then ask the equivalent of is this paper folded? and move on. Not only is this a waste of resources, but it also leads courts to misunderstand the proper scope of a registration. There are a number of changes, ranging from small tweaks to sweeping statutory reforms and the rejection of the Supreme Court's ahistorical conclusion that registration is a matter of factual accident rather than an important distinction between types of marks, that could improve the law to the benefit of trademark owners and nonowners alike.",2017,Government & Law

Using migration flows extracted from the SESTAT database and following a simultaneous equation approach, it finds that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between the migration flows of skilled economic agents and innovation (and productivity). Higher taxation and housing prices act as a decelerating force to migration.

TGF-beta 1 has been assumed as a dual factor in tumor growth, since it can repress epithelial tumor development in early stages, while it acts as a tumor promoter in the late stages of tumor progression. Cancer cells, during carcinogenesis, acquire migration and invasion capacity which enables them to metastasize. The urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) system, comprised of uPA, the cell surface receptor (uPAR) and plasminogen-plasmin, is involved in the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix and it also regulates several critical cellular events by its capacity to trigger the activation of intracellular signaling pathways. This enables the cancer cell survival, its dissemination, and enhancement of cell malignancy during tumor progression. The expression of both uPA and uPAR is finely regulated in normal development, but their expression is deregulated in cancer. TGF-beta regulates uPA expression in cancer cells while uPA, by conversion of plasminogen to active form, plasmin, may release TGF-beta 1 from its latent state. Thus, these pathways cross-regulate each other by mutual feedback contributing to tumor progression. Here, we review the specific roles and the interplay between TGF-beta 1 and uPA system in cancer cells, the current cancer therapies and the novel patents focused mainly on uPA and TGF-beta ligands and their cell surface receptors. Finally, with regard to the mutual activity of uPA and TGF-beta 1 in tumorigenesis, the aim of this chapter is to expose the potential of TGF-beta 1 and uPA systems to become combinatorial targets for therapies and patents.",2015,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

3D Printing Techniques in the Pharmaceutical Sciences - Intellectual Property Issues,3D printing; Intellectual property; Patents; Trade marks; Designs; Infringement; ,"Additive manufacturing, specifically three-dimensional printing (3DP), has been in use in the manufacture of medical devices for some time, with the FDA recently issuing draft guidance for technical considerations in this regard. More recently however, attention has turned to the use of these techniques in modern medicinal manufacture, in particular, orally administrable dosage forms and drug-loaded implants. In addition to the technical challenges faced by inventors in this field, there are a number of legal issues which are likely to develop as 3D printing becomes more widespread, more specifically regarding not only the procurement and enforcement of intellectual property rights, but also potentially arising at the interface of 3D printed pharmaceuticals with competition and consumer protection laws. Intellectual property law can be complex and varies from country to country. This chapter provides an introduction to intellectual property and a discussion of the aspects and issues that are most likely to be relevant to those working in the field of 3D printing of pharmaceuticals.",2018,Engineering; Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Improving the effectiveness of nondisclosure agreements by strengthening concept learning,; TRADE SECRETS; PROTECTION; PATENT; MANAGEMENT; QUESTIONS; LAW; IP,"Intellectual property infringements rank among the top economic crimes, even though there are mechanisms in place to prevent their occurrence. One such mechanism are nondisclosure agreements, which, however, have been reported to fail in practice. This article argues that this may be overcome by strengthening employees' concept learning. In an experiment, we investigated whether extended nondisclosure agreements, which provide the employee with detailed explanations and examples, lead to better recognition of trade secrets as compared to a standard nondisclosure agreement or no agreement at all. It was found that the extended nondisclosure agreement indeed increased participants' ability to judge what falls under the trade secret law, whereas the standard nondisclosure agreement showed no such effect. Furthermore, the effects of the factors `Involvement', `Specificity', `Publicity', and `Purpose' on the identification of trade secrets could be proven experimentally. Employees' judgments of whether an information represents a trade secret seem to rely on general cognitive processes. From this follows that concept learning could be integrated into systematic approaches for protecting intellectual property.",2017,Business & Economics

To this purpose, we have estimated an innovation production function that links innovation outputs to innovation input (namely investment in R&D) on a sample of manufacturing subsidiaries controlled by British multinationals and located in 30 countries. Our analysis covers the period 2005-2013. After controlling for the subsidiary's characteristics (including the ownership structure and whether the main shareholders are from Common Law countries), we find that independent boards may mitigate the negative impact of corruption on innovation as subsidiaries located in more corrupt countries and with more independent boards tend to invest more in R&D and register more valuable patents. These results still hold after controlling for the average age of the directors, the proportion of directors with no local business affiliations and government effectiveness. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Following controversies on the patenting of seeds in Canada and globally within the Committee for Food Security I explore what gave the impulse for political resistance in these different arenas. How did collective action emerge and how did it sustain itself? Three political concepts are important for understanding the political actions that I observed: Eigen-Sinn, empathy and strategy. These allowed me to follow and theorize political engagements. I first reflect on the potential to resist as a capacity of all human beings, because they have Eigen-Sinn: the capacity to attribute their own meanings to things, and act in their own self-interested way according to the meaning given. Self-interested action can only become political, however, when humans go beyond their strictly individual interests and empathize with others (humans and nonhumans), what Adorno described as getting into 'live contact with the warmth of things'. Finally, I discuss how collective action can become not only possible, but also effective, by building and defending a space for strategic action.",2019,Anthropology
The Forgotten History of Metes and Bounds,; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; LAW; LAND; PATENT; STANDARDIZATION; STRATEGIES; DEMARCATION; INFORMATION; EVOLUTION; ECONOMICS,"Since long before the settling of the American colonies, property boundaries were described by the metes and bounds method, a system of demarcation dependent on localized knowledge of movable stones, impermanent trees, and transient neighbors. Metes and bounds systems have long been the subject of ridicule among scholars, and a recent wave of law-and-economics scholarship has argued that land boundaries must be easily standardized to facilitate market transactions and yield economic development. However, historians have not yet explored the social and legal context surrounding earlier metes and bounds systems-obscuring the important role that nonstandardized property can play in stimulating growth. Using new archival research from the American colonial period, this Article reconstructs the forgotten history of metes and bounds within recording practice. Importantly, the benefits of metes and bounds were greater, and the associated costs lower, than an ahistorical examination of these records would indicate. The rich descriptions of the metes and bounds of colonial properties were customized to the preferences of American settlers and could be tailored to different types of property interests, permitting simple compliance with recording laws. While standardization is critical for enabling property to be understood by a larger and more distant set of buyers and creditors, customized property practices built upon localized knowledge serve other important social functions that likewise encourage development.",2019,Government & Law

So far, among current drugs approved for human use, only primaquine has transmission-blocking activity. The discovery of small molecules targeting different Plasmodium falciparum life stages remains a priority in antimalarial drug research. In this context, several independent studies have recently reported antiplasmodial and transmission-blocking activities of commonly used stains, dyes and fluorescent probes against P. falciparum including chloroquine-resistant isolates. Herein we have studied the antimalarial activities of dyes with different scaffold and we report that the triarylmethane dye (TRAM) Brilliant green inhibits the growth of asexual stages (IC50 <= 2 mu M) and has exflagellation-blocking activity (IC50 <= 800 nM) against P. falciparum reference strains (3D7, 7G8) and chloroquine-resistant clinical isolate (Q206). In a second step we have investigated the antiplasmodial activities of two polysulfonated triarylmethane food dyes. Green S (E142) is weakly active against P. falciparum asexual stage (IC50 similar or equal to 17 mu M) whereas Patent Blue V (E131) is inactive in both antimalarial assays. By applying liquid chromatography techniques for the culture supernatant analysis after cell washings and lysis, we report the detection of Brilliant green in erythrocytes, the selective uptake of Green S (E142) by infected erythrocytes, whereas Patent Blue V (E131) could not be detected within noninfected and 3D7-infected erythrocytes. Overall, our results suggest that two polysulfonated food dyes might display different affinity with transporters or channels on infected RBC membrane. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Hypoxia can be illness-related, like in many COPD patients, or it may be caused by broad range of external or iatrogenic factors - including influence of drugs depressing respiration, failure to keep the patient's prosthesis-supported airways patent, or a mistake in the operation of medical equipment supporting patient's respiration. Hypoxia, especially when it is not accompanied by rapid carbon dioxide retention, can go unnoticed for prolonged times, deepening existing CNS disorders, sometimes rapidly triggering their manifestation, or evoking quite new conditions and symptoms - like anxiety, agitation, aggressive behavior, euphoria, or hallucinations. Those, in turn, often result in situations raising interest in law enforcement institutions which need forensic medicine specialist's assistance and opinion. The possibility of illness or drug-related hypoxia, especially in terminal patients, is used to raise questions about the patients' ability to properly express their will in the way demanded by law - it also must be considered as a factor limiting the patients' responsibility in case they commit crimes. The possibility of hallucinations in hypoxia patients limits their credibility as witnesses or even their ability to report crime or sexual abuse they have been subjected to.",2015,Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology

Panel regression results show that for economic growth of city, the speed of technology transfer does not mean that faster is better. In other words, technology transfer maintaining a relatively rapid speed (more than 1 year and less than 2 years) can promote city economic growth, although the evidence is weak.",2019,Development Studies; Public Administration
Structural insights into a thermostable variant of human carbonic anhydrase II,protein engineering; carbon sequestration; thermostability; conformational energetics; AMINO-ACIDS; STABILITY; PROTEINS,"Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme of interest for many biotechnological developments including carbon sequestration. These applications often require harsh conditions, so there is a need for the development of thermostable variants. One of the most thermostable human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAIIts) variants was patented in 2006. Here, we report the ultra-high resolution crystal structure of HCAIIts. The structural changes seen are consistent with each of the six mutations involved acting largely independently and variously resulting in increased H-bonding, improved packing, and reduced side chain entropy loss on folding to yield the increased stability. We further suggest that for four of the mutations, improvements in backbone conformational energetics is also a contributor and that considerations of such conformational propensities of individual amino acids are often overlooked.",2018,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology

HOLMAN*",; MG SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTIONS; GLATIRAMER ACETATE; DOUBLE-BLIND; PILOT; COMPARE; EVERY,"In an inter partes review (IPR), the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (Board) struck down as obvious the Copaxone patents. The Copaxone patents describe and claim COPAXONE (R) 40mg/mL, a treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis wherein the active ingredient is glatiramer acetate (GA). The claimed treatment consists of the injection of 40mg of GA three times a week. Prior to COPAXONE (R) 40mg/mL, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved COPAXONE (R) 20mg/mL, a regimen consisting of the daily injection of 20mg GA. Daily GA injections were known to subject patients to discomfort and side effects that were reduced by switching to injection three times week at the higher dosage. One prior art reference disclosed administering 40mg GA every other day, and other prior art references would have motivated a person of ordinary skill in the art (POSITA) to switch to administering the drug less frequently than once a day in order to reduce adverse side effects, and a reasonable expectation that this change in the dosing regimen would maintain efficacy while reducing side effects. The Federal Circuit affirmed, pointing out the slight difference between the prior art's disclosure of administering 40mg seven times over a two-week period versus the claimed 40mg administered six times over a two-week period. The court affirmed the Board's reliance on a reference that was published after the priority date and thus did not qualify as statutory prior art but nonetheless could be used as non-prior art evidence to support and explain an expert's opinion that a POSITA would have thought less frequent dosing worthy of investigation as of the priority date.",2019,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

They contained significant and seminal technological results: a paper by Claude Shannon in 1948 and a patent by Horst Feistel in 1971. Shannon announced the scope at the start, writing, The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected *sent at another point [55, p. 379]. Shannon's coding theorem established the relationship between the probability of receiving the message in error and transmission rate measuring the process efficiency. Shannon proved the existence of codes achieving optimal performance, but it required 45 years to exhibit an actual code achieving it. The optimal-efficient Shannon codes are responsible for a wide range of communication technology we enjoy today, from GPS to the NASA rovers Spirit and Opportunity on Mars, and also to worldwide communication over the Internet. U.S. Patent #3798539A filed by the IBM Corporation in 1971 described Horst Feistel's block cipher cryptographic system, a new paradigm for encryption systems. It was a departure from the current cryptographic technology based on shift-register stream encryption for voice and the variety of the electromechanical cipher machines introduced nearly 50 years before. Horst's vision was its application to secure the privacy of computer files. It was invented at a propitious moment in time and implemented by IBM in automated teller machines for the Lloyds bank cashpoint system. The emergence of e-commerce in the next decades would far overshadow the value of encryption in banking business. Finally, it has drastically altered the SIGINT mission of the National Security Agency. While Horst Feistel did not directly participate to any of these commercial applications of cryptography, the traditional interpretation of the law of cause and effect certainly describes the effect of Feistel's patent.",2015,Computer Science; History & Philosophy of Science; Mathematics
"GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS, AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY AND NATIONAL OPT-OUTS: ENCLOSURE AS THE LOOPHOLE?",; ,"EU Member States face a quandary: after decades of demanding powers to choose whether or not to cultivate GMcrops, the EU has returned some limited but significant powers to them. A directive permits Member States to opt-out from GM cultivation, provided that they meet relevant criteria. Member States need to decide urgently and carefully whether and how to restrict GM crops, as the permeable nature of the environment facilitates the spread of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) once cultivated. One consideration is agri-sustainability. In principle, GM crops could promote agri-sustainability, including through increasing agrobiodiversity, as they facilitate introducing new traits or species into an ecosystem. However, the nature of their modifications allows for the applicability of patenting law, which enables the legal enclosure of the crops' genetic make-up. This impacts negatively upon the long-term availability of plant genetic resources and agrobiodiversity, as farmers and other breeders operate in a context where accidental cultivation of patented material can still attract liability. This article argues that legal enclosure could justify imposing restrictions on GM cultivation in order to conserve agrobiodiversity as an exhaustible natural resource essential to agri-sustainability. To improve the likelihood of restrictions being upheld legally at both the EU and WTO level, such justifications must be distinguished clearly from any broader environmental concerns, as both the EU and WTO impose stringent restrictions where environmental objectives are raised.",2017,International Relations; Government & Law
In Praise of Ex Ante Regulation,; EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION; PRODUCTS-LIABILITY; HEALTH-INSURANCE; RULES RATHER; ECONOMICS; TAX; POLICY; LAW; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION,"Timing is an important consideration in regulatory design. Corrective taxes are usually imposed before or contemporaneously with the harmful activity they are aimed at preventing, while tort awards are assessed ex post, in its aftermath. Patents and research grants both can encourage innovation, but patents pay off only after the invention is marketed. In a world of perfect information, fully rational actors, and complete credit or insurance markets, timing would not matter. In the real world though, the failure of one or more of these assumptions can change dramatically the impact of a regulatory option. For example, prior commentators have largely favored ex post incentives on the ground that government has much better information after the regulated activity is complete. This Article argues that the consensus in favor of ex post regulation overlooks some important considerations. Ex post regulation does provide useful additional information when regulated parties are heterogeneous, but also carries significant and sometimes prohibitive social cost, especially when limited-liability firms produce externalities. Further, drawing on results from mathematical simulations, I show that the costs of heterogeneity can be sharply reduced with even modest up-front information. I apply these insights to a series of examples, including the obesity crisis, the regulation of systemic risk in the banking sector, and state fiscal failures.",2015,Government & Law

In order to offer some insight based on the most frequently occurring terms our research focused on a limited amount of data, collected on uniform principles. The prefix nano comes about in many different compound words thus offering a possibility for such assessment. The aim is to identify the scatter of nanoconcepts, among and within journals, as well as more generally, in the Web of Science (WOS). Ten principal journals were identified along with all unique nanoterms in article titles. Such terms occur on average in half of all titles. Terms were thoroughly investigated and mapped by lemmatization or stemming to the appropriate roots-nanoconcepts. The scatter of concepts follows the characteristics of power laws, especially Zipf's law, exhibiting clear inversely proportional relationship between rank and frequency. The same three nanoconcepts are most frequently occurring in as many as seven journals. Two concepts occupy the first and the second rank in six journals. The same six concepts are the most frequently occurring in ten journals as well as full WOS database, representing almost two thirds of all nanotitled articles, in both instances. Subject categories don't play a decisive role. Frequency falls progressively, quickly producing a long tail of rare concepts. Drop is almost linear on the log scale.

How Oracle Erred The Use/Explanation Distinction and the Future of Computer Copyright,; ,"In Oracle v. Google (2015), the Federal Circuit addressed whether the method header components of a dominant computer program were uncopyrightable as merging with the headers' ideas or function. Google had copied the headers to ease the ability of third-party programmers to interact with Google's Android platform. The court rebuffed the copyrightability challenge; it reasoned that because the plaintiff's expression might have been written in alternative forms, there was no merger of idea and expression. But the Oracle court may have been asking the wrong question. In Lotus v. Borland (1995), the owner of a dominant spreadsheet program sought to prevent a new competitor's program from making available a set of command menu headers based on the dominant program's menus. The defendant also wrote its own, original command menus, but provided the copied menus as an option to relieve customers who, migrating from the dominant spreadsheet, would otherwise have had a substantial burden to master new terms and rewrite macros. In assessing the legality of the copying in Lotus, the First Circuit started its inquiry not with a question about how the plaintiff's program might have been written, but rather with how the program actually was written. It then identified the menu commands as methods of operation because they were necessary to make the actual program operate a computer. The copyright statute renders methods of operation per se uncopyrightable, regardless of the possibility of alternatives. Debates over the conflict between Oracle and Lotus have largely ignored a middle road that supports the Lotus result without the potential for overkill some observers see in Lotus. This middle road is a doctrine known as the explanation/use distinction. Laid out in the classic Supreme Court case of Baker v. Selden (1880), and ratified by statutory provisions of the Copyright Act including the much-ignored 113(b), the explanation/use distinction specifies that a copyright owner has no power to control behaviors that belong to the domain of utility patent. Like merger and method of operation, the explanation/use doctrine implements the deference that, pursuant to Congressional command and Supreme Court precedent, U.S. copyright law must give to patent law. However, the explanation/use doctrine operates by limiting the scope of the exclusive rights a copyright owner might otherwise possess, not by targeting the copyrightability of what plaintiff produced. This chapter examines justifications for the  explanation/use distinction, and suggests a two-part test for implementing that doctrine. The chapter argues that a copyright owner should have no prima facie rights over copying behavior where (1) the goals of the copying are  use (behavior in the realm of utility patent) and (2) the copying is done solely for goals unrelated to the expressiveness of the plaintiff's work of authorship. (The copying in Oracle and Lotus seems to have been fully indifferent to expressive values; the result might be different in a case where defendant's goals are mixed.) This two-part test is met by the defendants in Oracle and Lotus. (1) Making a machine operate is clearly utilitarian. And as for (2) indifference to expression, both Lotus and Oracle involve someone copying a computer interface to enable users to interoperate: third-party programmers could use or design Java-enabled programs on Android, and spreadsheet users could use their prior macros on a new spreadsheet program. Interoperability is one of the few areas where indifference to expression is clear: After all, when one wants a spare key made, the elegance or beauty of the key's shape is irrelevant - all that matters is that the shape fits the lock.",2017,Government & Law
Human Embryo Gene Editing in China: The Uncertain Legal Status of the Embryo,CRISPR; Human embryo gene editing; Legal status of human embryo; Research regulation; Morality; China; CRISPR,"In this article, we examine processes of ethical deliberation, legislative developments, and social and political factors that have contributed to the emergence of human embryo gene editing as a field of life science research in China. For this purpose, we examine conceptions of the legal status of the human embryo in three domains of China's legal system: in patent law, in the jurisdictional domain of birth control, and in civil law. Each of these legal domains handles a different conception of the human embryo's moral and legal status, and in all three the embryo's status is contested and subject to changes. Our findings suggest that definitions of the legal status of the human embryo in China are at present in the midst of a renegotiation progress, which is driven by a variety of developments and causes. In this paper, we focus on three types of controversies that underlie this renegotiation process and we illustrate the conflicting aspirations, ethical arguments, and moral priorities that inform these conflicts. We end this article with three lines of consideration that might structure future studies on this issue.",2019,Biomedical Social Sciences

Docking and binding energy studies were carried out to reveal details regarding the favorable interactions between the scaffolds of these new inhibitors and the active sites of the investigated CA isoforms. Most of the novel compounds were acting as highly potent inhibitors of the tumor-associated hCA IX and hCA XII with K(I)s in the nanomolar range. The ubiquitous and dominant rapid cytosolic isozyme hCA II was also inhibited with K(I)s ranging from 3.5 to 45.4 nM. The favorable interactions between some of the new compounds and the active site of different CA isoforms were delineated by using molecular docking which may be useful for designing compounds with high affinity and selectivity for some CAs with biomedical applications.

Technological innovations are a source of economic growth but act as a double-edged sword in their effects on urban green development. This study aimed to determine whether technological innovations promote or impede the enhancement of urban eco-efficiency in China and also to reveal regional and administrative-level differences in terms of the effects of technological innovations. We selected the number of granted invention patents and the proportion of technology-related revenue in the total revenue of national high-technology industrial development zones (NHTIDZs) as indicators to represent knowledge innovation and product innovation, respectively, and used the spatial autoregressive model to examine the effects of the two innovations on urban eco-efficiency. The results showed that technological innovations, which enhanced urban eco-efficiency, had a greater impact on eastern cities than on central and western cities. The higher was the administrative level of a city, the greater were the effects of invention patents on urban eco-efficiency. Moreover, the higher was the administrative level of a city, the smaller was the role that NHTIDZs played in promoting urban eco-efficiency, which represented a case of diminishing marginal utility.

Discovered almost a quarter century ago, IL-17A is known to have poor biologic activity when acting alone, but attains robust actions when working synergistically with potent mediators of proinflam-matory immune responses, such as IL-6 and IL-8. IL-17A is produced by specialized innate immune cells that protect host barriers from the outside world. Like sentries, these innate immune cells can sound the alarm through increased production of IL-17A, causing activation and recruitment of primed neutrophils and monocytes when pathogens escape initial host defenses. In this way, IL-17A promulgates mechanisms responsible for pathogen death and clearance. However, when IL-17A pathways are triggered during fetal development, due to chorioamnionitis or in utero inflammatory conditions, IL-17A can instigate and/or exacerbate fetal inflammatory responses that increase neonatal morbidities and mortality associated with common neonatal conditions such as sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This review details the ontogeny of IL-17A in the fetus and newborn, discusses how derangements in its production can lead to pathology, and describes known and evolving therapies that may attenuate IL-17A-mediated human conditions.",2018,Immunology; Reproductive Biology

Most of them are anticancer agents, and few possess other therapeutic effects. Areas covered: The most recent biologically-active pyrrolopyridine derivatives have been reviewed from the patents and research articles published from 2010 to the mid of 2016. Their structural and biological features have been explained. In general, the pyrrolopyridine scaffold mimics the purine ring of the ATP molecule. So the well-designed pyrrolopyridine analogues can successfully act as kinase inhibitors for treatment of cancer and/or other diseases. The most successful pyrrolopyridine derivative that is currently used in the market is vemurafenib, which is used for treatment of melanoma. Its chemical and biological features have been reviewed and explained. Expert opinion: The heterocyclic pyrrolopyridine nucleus mimics the purine ring of ATP. So they can work as inhibitors of the kinase at hinge region. Due to the structural similarity with ATP, these pyrrolopyridine derivatives are estimated to be non-selective kinase inhibitors. The selectivity is conferred mainly from the different substituents attached to the azaindole nucleus. More details are presented in the Expert Opinion' section at the end of this article. This section covers the chemistry and the biological properties of therapeutically-efficient pyrrolopyridine-possessing compounds.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

A multilevel analysis of intellectual property right policies' on academic entrepreneurship",Intellectual property rights policies; Academic entrepreneurship; Multilevel models; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; NATURAL-SCIENCES; UNIVERSITY INVENTIONS; PATENT QUALITY; COMMERCIALIZATION; OWNERSHIP; RESEARCHERS; IMPACT; WEAK; ACT,"The political environment around universities has led them to create an infrastructure to manage academic inventions. While some consider that the advantages of a university entrepreneurial structure outweigh any potential negative effects, others question their detrimental effect on academic scientists' entrepreneurial behavior. However, this debate remains unresolved as none of these two views have been fully empirically supported. Using multilevel models for a population of 2230 professors in 27 universities in Canada (82 individuals per unit on average), we test the effect of three features of institutional intellectual property right policy characteristics, namely, property rights (ownership regime), control rights (obligation to disclose and option to commercialize), and income-sharing schemes (when commercialization involves the university or an individual inventor) on two commercial behaviors of faculty members, namely, formal commercialization (patent and spinoff creation), and informal commercialization (consulting and commercial agreement). Our results suggest that contrary to most of the literature, academic inventors' behavior is influenced not by the invention ownership regime but by the control rights in place and the sharing of income between the university and the academic inventors. The findings have some implications for the importance of an ownership regime and the ineffectiveness of institutional policies which create contradictory motivations for academic entrepreneurs. It suggests some directions for future research using multilevel models.",2017,Business & Economics
Can expired proprietary maize (Zea mays L.) industry lines be useful for short-season breeding programs?

The purpose of this study was to assess the grain quality properties of ex-PVP maize short-season inbred lines. Three sets of North Carolina Mating Design II crosses were made with 12 NDSU lines, 24 ex-PVP lines, and seven current industry testers in the 2010 and 2010-2011 seasons. Hybrids and checks were arranged in partially balanced lattice trials across six ND environments in 2011 and 2012. Both general combining ability and specific combining ability were important for regulating most grain quality traits with the preponderance of additive genetic variance. However, there is still lack of interest for developing inbred lines and hybrids with top grain quality traits. If ex-PVP inbred lines do not have the potential to compete with current lines, still, those with good combining ability for grain quality could complement other germplasm sources when the market is ready to pay premiums for a better maize quality. Public breeding programs have the opportunity to increase the value of this particular commodity and complement industry efforts for a better and more profitable crop for U.S. farmers.",2015,Agriculture; Plant Sciences

The reason is their potential to influence socio-technical regimes connected to policy areas in which they have authority. Supported by mandates, moral standing and technical expertise, IGOs act in two ways: operating with high level of political support, these organisations guide priority setting and norm development through the definition of collective problems and solutions, including STI aspects, establishing a shared vision; involving public and private actors, IGOs implement and protect novel practices that reinforce the new norms, from legally binding agreements to the creation of new spaces for international collaboration. These processes are examined here in the field of global health, where outside pressure directed at the intellectual property rules in connection to access to medicines prompted the WHO to define the health challenge as a need to stimulate innovation and ensure wide access to technology at the same time. Two of the solutions implemented by IGOs to achieve both goals are analysed: the Medicines Patent Pool, designed by UNITAID to fulfil access and innovation needs in relation to HIV/AIDS drugs, and WIPO Re;Search, set up by WIPO to support collaboration and accelerate discovery and product development for Neglected Tropical Diseases, Malaria and Tuberculosis.

Artificial submillimeter-diameter vascular grafts with clinically useful size of 0.6 mm inner diameter and 5 cm length were prepared and evaluated by replacing the axial artery of free flap in rats. The rat tail artery, selected as a novel bioscaffold material, was decellularized using ultrahigh-hydrostatic pressure (UHP) method and compared with the detergent-based conventional method. To induce rapid endothelialization, the graft lumen was modified with synthesized peptides, having high affinity to the endothelial progenitor cells. The UHP method and peptide modification at 37 degrees C were found to preserve the extracellular matrix structure well, leading to the stable immobilization of the peptide at the luminal surface. These grafts showed the neointima formation, even at the center position far from the native vessels, remained patent for three weeks, and resulted in the flap survival in the rat free-flap model. The tissue-engineered vascular grafts with functionalized lumen have great future potential as an alternative to autologous vein grafts in free flap transfers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"FAIR USE, NOTICE FAILURE, AND THE LIMITS OF COPYRIGHT AS PROPERTY",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; CONTEXT; PATENT; RULES; COSTS; LAW,"If we start with the assumption that copyright law creates a system of property rights, to what extent does this system give adequate notice to third parties regarding the scope of such rights, particularly given the prominent role played by the fair use doctrine? This essay argues that, although the fair use doctrine may provide adequate notice to sophisticated third parties, it fails to provide adequate notice to less sophisticated parties. Specifically, the fair use doctrine imposes nearly insuperable informational burdens upon the general public regarding the scope of the property entitlement and the corresponding duty to avoid infringement. Moreover, these burdens have only increased with changes in technology that enable more, and more varied, uses of copyrighted works. The traditional response to uncertainty in fair use has been to suggest ways of curing the notice failure by providing clearer rules about what is and is not permitted This essay suggests, however, that these efforts to reinforce the property framework feel 'increasingly strained and fail to reflect how copyright law is actually experienced by the general public. Indeed, the extent of the notice failure is such that it may be time to stop treating copyright like a property right, at least for certain classes of users. The essay ends by suggesting a number of alternative frameworks that would seek to regulate public behavior regarding copyrighted works without imposing the unrealistic informational burdens required by a system of property rights.",2016,Government & Law
Innovation Heuristics: Experiments on Sequential Creativity in Intellectual Property,; BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS; RATIONAL CHOICE; EX ANTE; PATENT; LAW; COPYRIGHT; MARKETS; IRRATIONALITY; INFORMATION; PSYCHOLOGY,"All creativity and innovation build on existing ideas. Authors and inventors copy, adapt, improve, interpret, and refine the ideas that have come before them. The central task of intellectual property (IP) law is regulating this sequential innovation to ensure that initial creators and subsequent creators receive the appropriate sets of incentives. Although many scholars have applied the tools of economic analysis to consider whether IP law is successful in encouraging cumulative innovation, that work has rested on a set of untested assumptions about creators' behavior. This Article reports four novel creativity experiments that begin to test those assumptions. In particular, we study how creators decide whether to copy, or borrow, from existing ideas or to innovate around them. Our data suggest that creators do not consistently behave the way that economic analysis assumes. Instead of rationally weighing the objective costs and benefits of different courses of action, creators instead were influenced by decision-making heuristics and individual preferences that often led to suboptimal and inefficient creative behavior. Many of our subjects chose to borrow when innovating was the optimal strategy, and even more chose to innovate when borrowing was the optimal strategy. We find that subjects are only mildly responsive to external incentives. Rather, choices between innovation and borrowing correlated much more powerfully with their internal, subjective beliefs about the difficulty of innovating. We conclude by exploring the implications of our data for innovation markets and IP doctrine.",2016,Government & Law

Information acquires the role of entertainment (infotainment), and the ritualistic acts of generating media messages (one liners by politicians or celebrities; creation of public scandals on political, financial, or sexual topics; public apologies for social or private breakings of social or moral rules) have become relevant (and sometimes dominating) parts of our everyday lives.

This study examines the health seeking behaviour, patient-provider interaction and quality of care received by febrile patients of different socio-economic status (SES) groups. Methods: A total of 1642 febrile patients and caregivers exiting public health centres, pharmacies and patent medicine dealers were surveyed in Enugu state, South-East Nigeria to obtain information on treatment seeking behaviour, patient-provider interactions and treatment received. Socioeconomic status was estimated for each patient using exit survey data on household assets in combination with asset ownership data from the 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. Results: Among the poorest SES group, 29% sought treatment at public health centres, 13% at pharmacies and 58% at patent medicine dealers (p < 0.01). Very few of those in the richest SES group used public health centres (4%) instead choosing to go to pharmacies (44%) and patent medicine dealers (52%, p < 0.001). During consultations with a healthcare provider, the poorest compared to the richest were significantly more likely to discuss symptoms with the provider, be physically examined and rely on providers for diagnosis and treatment rather than request a specific medicine. Those from the poorest SES group were however, least likely to request or to receive an antimalarial (p < 0.001). The use of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), the recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria, was low across all SES groups. Conclusions: The quality of malaria treatment is sub-optimal for all febrile patients. Having greater interaction with the provider also did not translate to better quality care for the poor. The poor face a number of significant barriers to accessing quality treatment especially in relation to treatment seeking behaviour and type of treatment received. Strategies to address these inequities are fundamental to achieving universal coverage of effective malaria treatment and ensuring that the most vulnerable people are not left behind.",2015,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
The Postcolonial Time That Remains,"Australian colonization; Agamben, Giorgio; postcolonial law; social transformation; discontinuity; postcolonial temporality; Indigenous sovereignty; ","Sovereign authority to establish the colony of South Australia was given by Letters Patent (1836), signed by King William IV. The Letters Patent made explicit provision for the recognition and protection of Indigenous rights and interests in traditional lands and waters, establishing the basis for a peaceable and respectful interaction between Indigenous and settler societies. However, the preexisting sovereignty of Indigenous peoples was not respected and these written orders were ignored by the South Australian Company in its executive action to establish the Province of South Australia. Accordingly, the potential for development of positive forms of intercultural social relationship remained unrealized in this region, as was also the case throughout the Australian colonies. This essay reflects upon the transformative force of this unrealized potential, which remains immanent within the trajectory of Australian history. It makes use of Agamben's conceptualization of time and exigency in The Time That Remains (2005) to theorize directed processes of historical discontinuity. We analyse colonial sources of contemporary Australian society, with a renewed attention to those aspects of political recognition and positively shared social life that were always possible but never came to pass into history. We argue that the experience of time and temporality in the 'messianic mode' enables new understanding of the problematic 'time of the now' and recreates possibilities for the communal invention of postcolonial futures that respond properly to ongoing and contemporary Indigenous practices of sovereignty and nationhood.",2015,Cultural Studies; History
"The sun without a permit': Serbian solar politics, informational risk cascades, and the Great Disappearing Act of August 1999",environmental risk; informational cascade; solar eclipse; ECLIPSE,"In the summer of 1999, the Serbian Ministry of Health issued a public health warning about the environmental risks associated with the total solar eclipse to took place on 11 August. The warning contained a list of phantom symptoms unknown to medical profession. Some of these included severe itching, hypertension, cardiac palpitation and frequent urination. Despite the warning's patent absurdity, the Serbian public widely observed it by seeking indoor and underground shelter from the lunar shadow, participating in what I term a great public disappearing act'. By contrast, the rest of Europe and the Middle East embraced the event as a public spectacle, with millions thronging the streets and observation posts. This paper raises two key questions: Why did the Serbian government issue the odd warning? And why did the Serbian public observe it? In contrast to the conventional readings of the event as a compound effect of a political manipulation and a lack of public scientific education, I argue that the public behavior on the eclipse day was a meaningful response to the social, political and environmental circumstances in the worn-torn Serbia. Using insights from the social amplification of risk framework, I demonstrate that the great disappearing act was a paradigmatic example of herd behavior governed by the media-driven informational cascades. I further argue that the actors involved in the production and reproduction of phantom ecliptic risks - doctors, journalists, government officials, ordinary citizens - jointly enhanced their plausibility in a way that eventually eliminated the possibility of any behavior not mediated by the cascading processes of risk production.",2018,History & Philosophy of Science
Land use and management in Benin Republic: An evaluation of the effectiveness of Land Law 2013-01,Land Law 2013-01; Land use and management; Benin Republic; ,"Inefficient land use and management is rampant in developing countries. The most patent manifestation of this is the chaotic state of land use practices in cities. It's also demonstrated that the success of public policies and strategies in land use, urban planning, protection of natural resources, housing, agriculture, industry, transport and tourism, depends largely on the land resource management by the State and the Local Communities. Unfortunately, in the Republic of Benin, the land management is characterized by the lack of land mastership and the growing of land insecurity which did not promote sustained policy of investments and increased the failure of many peoples in Benin population, both in rural and in urban areas at the benefit of a minority. With the increasing competition for it access due to the rapid urbanization occurred in the last two decades, the land issue has become a major concern for the population and for the political and administrative authorities. To regulate the land access all over the country, in the National Assembly in May 2013, the Benin government introduced a Land Law project which was adopted by the National Assembly of Benin on the 14th of August, 2013. The law is a common framework regarding all lands; it integrates land acquisition procedures, expropriation procedures, public utility land management, environment and natural resources preservation, land property rights, conflict management, and the administrative structure for land management. But after four years of the Land Law 2013-01 being implemented, land use in Benin remains a huge challenge for the government. Indigenous settlements can often be found in wetlands and flood-prone areas along the city where communities established many years ago are exposed to urban risks and a degraded living environment in Cotonou, a major city and economic pole of Benin. The situation is worsened by the many conflicts occurring among communities due to unsecured land transactions. This study examines Land Law 2013-01 and its impact on land use and land ownership across Benin Republic. More specifically, it discusses the effectiveness and limitations of the law since its implementation. The structure of this paper is organized into five sections as follows. Section 1 introduces the context and objectives of the study. Section 2 presents a chronological evolution of land policies and the major changes in the land use from the colonial period to the post-colonial period. Section 3 introduces Land Law 2013-01. Section 4 discusses effectiveness and limitations of the law. Section 5 gives conclusions and recommendations. The key shortcomings include: a clear understanding of the multiple land access modes which is a necessary tool for sustainable land development, the legal dualism created by the coexistence of customary laws and the modem registration system, the vulnerability of legal land security and the inadequate land information management system.",2018,Environmental Sciences & Ecology

Apart from a literal adoption of an international norm, we show that the domestic implementation may change its emphasis (accentuation), amend it by supplementary purposes (addition), or imply a deviation which nevertheless sticks to the letter of the international wording (subversion). We argue that the specific form of localization depends on the interaction between international pressure politics and its congruence with the prevailing domestic public and private preferences. International power constellations explain why an international norm is implemented, but the specific character of its localization is mainly determined by domestic actor constellations. To substantiate our claims, we analyze the implementation of two interconnected international agreements in India and Brazil. While both the Convention on Biodiversity and the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights introduce the norm of property rights for intellectual knowledge in previously (at least internationally) unregulated fields, the particular characteristics of their respective implementation in both countries display the interaction between international pressure and domestic preferences in our four case studies.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Synthesis of feedback-based design concepts for sensors,Conceptual design; Computational design synthesis; Functional modelling; Indirect-sensing; Closed loop; FUNCTIONAL SYNTHESIS; SYSTEMS,"We explore an approach to synthesize concepts of a class of sensors, where a quantity is sensed indirectly after nullifying its effect by using negative feedback. These sensors use negative feedback to increase the dynamic range of operation without compromising the sensitivity and resolution. The synthesis technique uses knowledge about existing phenomena to come up with an approach to synthesize concepts of sensors and also study their interactions with their surroundings, so as to generate robust designs. The approach uses a database of building blocks which are based on physical laws and effects that capture the transduction rules underlying the working principles of sensors. A simplified variant of the SAPPhIRE model of causality, which also uses physical laws and effects, has been adapted to represent the building blocks. SAPPhIRE model had been used earlier to understand analysis and synthesis of conceptual designs. We have adapted it here for automated generation of concepts. The novelty of the approach lies in the way and the ease with which it constructs a graph which is a super-set of the concept-space. The individual concepts are extracted out of the graph at a later point in time. The extraction of the concepts is done by using a modified breadth-first search algorithm which detects loops in the graph. The usage of breadth-first search algorithm for loop detection is novel, as we have demonstrated that it performs better than depth-first search algorithm for the specific problem. The technique has been implemented as a web-based application. For the sensor problems attempted, a number of existing patents were found that were based on the concepts that were generated by the synthesis algorithm, thus emphasizing the usefulness of the designs produced. The tool generated 35 concepts for accelerometers, out of which 2 concepts were found in patents. The synthesis approach also proposed new, feasible sensor concepts, thereby indicating its potential as a stimulator for enhancing creativity of designers. Automated generation of feedback-based sensor designs is a novel outcome of this approach.",2017,Engineering
Can expired proprietary maize (Zea mays L.) industry lines be useful for short-season breeding programs? II.

The overall objective of this research was to assess the usefulness of patent expired maize inbred lines. Factorial crosses were made including North Dakota State University (NDSU) lines, ex-PVP lines, and top industry testers in the 2010 NDSU Fargo summer nursery and in the 2010-2011 NDSU New Zealand winter nursery. Hybrids were planted across six different ND environments in 2011 and 2012 following partially balanced lattice experimental designs. Combining ability analyses were performed following a factorial design with fixed parents. Our research identified ex-PVP inbreds PH207, Q381, PHP02, S8324, PHK76, CR1Ht, PHT77, LH205, LH54, and PHJ40 as above average lines in hybrid combinations to increase yield. Our trials suggest most ex-PVP lines are not useful directly for commercial purposes but could be used as potential breeding sources for short-season maize breeding programs. Improvements in intellectual property and re-thinking of breeding rights access are encouraged to explore more suitable hybrids for northern U.S. farms. Current industry lines have important trait weaknesses for northern U.S. climates that public sector breeders in strategic breeding locations could improve in order to develop better hybrids for farmers. Our preferred choice would be to partner with industry in order to improve current industry lines with known weaknesses, especially for northern U.S. and Canada environments.",2016,Agriculture; Plant Sciences
CONCEPTUAL SEPARABILITY AS CONCEIVABILITY: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS OF THE USEFUL ARTICLES DOCTRINE,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW; COPYRIGHT; ECONOMICS; FASHION; DESIGN,"In copyright law, the useful articles doctrine plays a significant role in defining the limits of copyright's domain and the boundary between copyright and patent. But the implicated notion of conceptual separability has proved to be difficult to define, and the Supreme Court's effort to define it in the recent case Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc. is unsatisfying. In an effort to resolve this challenge, the present paper puts forth a novel test for conceptual separability, one that draws inspiration from the philosopher's idea of conceivability. The test is the following question: When you conceive of the relevant useful article as lacking the design element in question, is the article you imagine functionally identical to the actual article? If the answer to this question is yes, then the design element is conceptually separable from the article's utilitarian aspects; if not, then the element has failed the test, and it is not entitled to copyright protection. The present paper explores why this novel proposal avoids many of the pitfalls of existing tests (including the Court's own in Star Athletica), why it best achieves the aims of the useful articles doctrine, and what questions remain once the challenge of conceptual separability has been resolved.",2018,Government & Law
Arbitration in SEP/FRAND Disputes: Overview and Core Issues,; ,"This article takes a look at arbitration in intellectual property matters with regards to the licensing of standard-essential patents (SEPs) on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Due to the digital transformation, the importance of FRAND licensing of SEPs is likely to increase and with it the need for appropriate conflict resolution. This is where arbitration can come into play due to its flexibility and efficiency. The resolution of SEP/FRAND disputes through Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is also supported by administrative and judicial bodies and institutions such as the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) or the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) have already gained experience in this field. The article lays down particularities regarding the scope of arbitration in such disputes before briefly touching upon the question of arbitrability. Due to the lack of a law applicable to a pre-existing contract in prototypical SEP/FRAND constellations, the choice of law is also of importance. A special emphasis is put on the issue of confidentiality in view of a public interest in having access to key results of SEP/FRAND arbitration proceedings. As set forth in the article, the FRAND ADR Guidelines authored by the Munich IPDR Forum propose a solution in the form of disclosure of the FRAND determination methodology to a neutral instance, subject to party approval. Lastly, the article looks at how state courts might assess licenses reached in alternative dispute resolution and examines whether EU competition law is a public policy hurdle in subsequent enforcement proceedings.",2019,Government & Law
Legal orientalism? The poor Chinese culture and US-China intellectual property disputes since the late Qing dynasty,China; intellectual property; legal orientalism; patent; Qing dynasty; TRIPS; US; ,"From the nineteenth-century late Qing dynasty reform to China's endeavor to construct a twenty-first-century knowledge economy, intellectual property has frequently stuck out as a core agenda of China-foreign diplomatic and trading relations. Such a history is usually interpreted from two perspectives: one is an 'infringement perspective' in which China is understood as a notorious infringer of foreign intellectual property; the other is a ` transplant perspective' which argues that China's modern intellectual property laws emerge and progress as the consequence of foreign pressure. Both interpretations intend to hold that China's passive role in modern intellectual property law making is ultimately cultural - that is, the notion of intellectual property is alien to Chinese culture. This paper takes a completely different cultural perspective. Through micro-level historical details, it addresses the following fundamental question - was the authentic Chinese culture present or accessible by the Westerners (as well as many Chinese) in that part of history? In a broader context, it further addresses another crucial question - if the authentic Chinese culture is yet to be presented or accessible, shouldn't (legal) orientalism be regarded as a consequence of cultural unawareness rather than cultural prejudice?",2019,Government & Law
"Fracking in Indian Country: The Federal Trust Relationship, Tribal Sovereignty, and the Beneficial Use of Produced Water",; ,"Potentially toxic wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing-known as produced water-are not subject to RCRA's or the CWA's permitting requirements. This is because the EPA has categorized produced water as a special waste when put to beneficial uses in arid regions. Some chemical components in produced water, however, are patented trade secrets that may prove injurious to human health. This Article addresses the issue of produced water as it relates to Native American tribal lands, where fracking activity is increasingly common. Despite their status as sovereign nations, Native American tribes neither have the authority to impose their own produced water permitting standards under RCRA, nor the ability to meet financially burdensome standards in order to regulate water quality under the CWA. Together, these regulatory exemptions and unrealistic standards form a livestock loophole that allows untreated produced water disposal onto Native American lands. This Article, at the nexus of environmental law and Indian law, argues that tribes have an important and distinct role in both accepting or declining produced water discharges on tribal lands, and in setting their own water quality standards under the CWA. This Article then makes recommendations consistent with such an account of tribal sovereignty and the federal government's responsibility under the Federal Trust Doctrine.",2015,Government & Law
Pathways to ensure universal and affordable access to hepatitis C treatment,Healthcare financing; Hepatitis C; Treatment; DIRECT-ACTING ANTIVIRALS; VIRUS-INFECTION; INJECT DRUGS; UNITED-STATES; PEOPLE; ELIMINATION; SOFOSBUVIR; THERAPY; CARE; HCV,"Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have dramatically changed the landscape of hepatitis C treatment and prevention. The World Health Organization has called for the elimination of hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030. However, the discrepancy in DAA prices across low-, middle- and high-income countries is considerable, ranging from less than US$ 100 to approximately US$ 40,000 per course, thus representing a major barrier for the scale-up of treatment and elimination. This article describes DAA pricing and pathways to accessing affordable treatment, providing case studies from Australia, Egypt and Portugal. Pathways to accessing DAAs include developing comprehensive viral hepatitis plans to facilitate price negotiations, voluntary and compulsory licenses, patent opposition, joint procurement, and personal importation schemes. While multiple factors influence the price of DAAs, a key driver is a country's capacity and willingness to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. If negotiations do not lead to a reasonable price, governments have the option to utilise flexibilities outlined in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Affordable access to DAAs is underpinned by collaboration between government, civil society, global organisations and pharmaceutical companies to ensure that all patients can access treatment. Promoting these pathways is critical for influencing policy, improving access to affordable DAAs and achieving hepatitis C elimination.",2018,General & Internal Medicine
Employment protection and the market for innovations,Employment protection; Firing costs; Innovations; Patents; Productivity; Market imperfections; EQUILIBRIUM UNEMPLOYMENT; PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH; CYCLICAL BEHAVIOR; SEARCH; TURNOVER; DYNAMICS,"We study the effects of employment protection taking into account that firms can as a second best response invest in R & D or buy new technologies in order to restore their productivity. To do so we develop an equilibrium matching model with an imperfect labor and innovation market. If employment protection is introduced, firms' willingness to pay for product or process innovations increases. This shifts economic activity towards firms specializing in process and product innovation and triggers entry of new start-ups. We calibrate our model to match aggregate US labor and product market statistics and show that our model generates the negative impact of wrongful dismissal laws in the US on productivity and the positive effect on the number of innovations and firms found by the literature.",2017,Business & Economics
Allometric scaling and accidents at work,accidents at work; allometric scaling; statistical data; size of an enterprise; ORIGIN; LAWS,"Allometry is the knowledge concerning relations between the features of some beings, like animals, or cities. For example, the daily energy rate is proportional to a mass of mammals rise of 3/4. This way of thinking has spread quickly from biology to many areas of research concerned with sociotechnical systems. It was revealed that the number of innovations, patents or heavy crimes rises as social interaction increases in a bigger city, while other urban indexes such as suicides decrease with social interaction. Enterprise is also a sociotechnical system, where social interaction and accidents at work take place. Therefore, do these interactions increase the number of accidents at work or, on the contrary, are they reduction-driving components? This article tries to catch such links and assess the allometric exponent between the number of accidents at work and the number of employees in an enterprise.",2016,"Engineering; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
Intellectual Property & Global Policy,; ,"This article discusses Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and in particular global IPR expansion. That globally protected intellectual property (IP) is more valuable than ever must be set against the fact that today's global network capitalism, in which IP is so valuable, also enables information to circulate beyond IP control. Similarly, global IP expansion and its resistance go hand in hand, as global IP expansionist policy contains but also encourages infringement. We document this conflict, the paradoxical space affording it, the boundary disputes that manifest it, and the global IP expansionist policy ratchet' designed, but which fails, to contain it. We then evaluate global IPRs and the case for extensions, as manifested in treaties such as ACTA, TPP and TTIP. This evaluation is undertaken though specific examinations of copyright, patent and trademark laws. Claims for the overall social benefit of global IP harmonisation and expansion policies are rejected.",2017,International Relations; Government & Law
THE ESSENTIAL STRUCTURE OF PROPERTY LAW,; LIABILITY RULES; SECURED CLAIMS; ONE-VIEW; POSSESSION; PRIORITY; BUNDLE; INFORMATION; CONTRACT; EXCLUDE; NOTICE,"fThis Article examines a characteristic of property entitlements fundamental to the structure of property systems that has received scant academic attention, a characteristic referred to as the mutual exclusivity principle. According to this principle, a property system does not allow for the existence of incompatible rights. Two people cannot separately be the owners of the same resource, for instance. By contrast, two people can each hold valid but contradictory contract rights to the resource. Although the existing property literature has stressed the exclusive nature of property, the various ways in which property is imagined to be exclusive, such as by conferring rights to exclude, fail to capture the essence of property as a distinct legal institution. Unlike these alternative conceptions of exclusiveness, the mutual exclusivity principle holds true across the range of different types of property entitlements, including not just fee simple ownership but also security interests and servitudes, and across the range of assets subject to property law, including not just land and physical objects but also intangibles like intellectual property and corporate shares. Recognizing the role of the mutual exclusivity principle yields a number of practical insights. It helps explain various institutional features of property law, such as the system of future interests, the use of possession -based rules, the role of recording systems, and the negative, thing -based structure of property entitlements. It illuminates connections between property and other fields like corporations law and it calls into question aspects of existing doctrine, such as the preferred status of exclusion rights under the U.S. Constitution's Takings Clause. It also modifies the influential theory that property law is heavily shaped by problems of high information costs: while existing accounts seem to suppose that property law entails relatively high information costs because it imposes a relatively broad set of duties on others, many of the information cost problems identified in the literature actually result from the mutual exclusivity problem, rather than from the breadth of property duties. At a more general level, understanding the centrality of the mutual exclusivity principle suggests some change in direction is called for within the wider property literature. American property scholarship has been preoccupied with questions about the scope and strength of property rights, overlooking the separate problem of ascertaining who happens to hold a given right, a problem distinctive to property law. Property, this Article argues, is at least as much about title chains, patent searches, and creditor priorities as it is about trespass, remedies, and eminent domain.",2017,Government & Law
The effect of gun control laws on hospital admissions for children in the United States,Firearms; gunshot wounds; legislation; violence; CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC-HERNIA; PATENT DUCTUS-ARTERIOSUS; FIREARM-RELATED INJURIES; AVAILABILITY; LEGISLATION; MORTALITY; PREMATURE; HOMICIDE; LIGATION; SURVIVAL,"BACKGROUND: Gun control laws vary greatly between states within the United States. We hypothesized that states with strict gun laws have lower mortality and resource utilization rates from pediatric firearms-related injury admissions. METHODS: Kids' Inpatient Database (1997-2012) was searched for accidental (E922), self-inflicted (E955), assault (E965), legal intervention-related (E970), or undetermined circumstance (E985) firearm injuries. Patients were younger than 20 years and admitted for their injuries. Case incidence trends were examined for the study period. Propensity score-matched analyses were performed using 38 covariates to compare outcomes between states with strict or lenient gun control laws. RESULTS: Overall, 38,424 cases were identified, with an overall mortality of 7%. Firearm injuries were most commonly assault (64%), followed by accidental (25%), undetermined circumstance (7%), or self-inflicted (3%). A small minority involved militarygrade weapons (0.2%). Most cases occurred in lenient gun control states (48%), followed by strict (47%) and neutral (6%). On 1: 1 propensity score-matched analysis, in-hospital mortality by case was higher in lenient (7.5%) versus strict (6.5%) states, p = 0.013. Lenient states had a proportionally higher rate of accidental (31%) and self-inflicted injury (4%) versus strict states (17% and 1.6%, respectively), p < 0.001. Assault-related injuries were proportionally lower in lenient (54%) versus strict (75%) states, p < 0.001. Military-grade weapons were more common in lenient (0.4%) versus strict (0.1%) states, p = 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of legislative measures and their role in injury prevention, as firearm injuries are entirely avoidable mechanisms of injury. Lenient gun control contributes not only to worse outcomes per case, but also to a more significant and detrimental impact on public health. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

COMMERCIALIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS FOUNDATION FOR INNOVATION,commercialization of intellectual property rights; innovations; ,"Introduction. Innovations are considered impossible without intellectual, creative work of authors. Inventors and others are involved into this process. Ukraine has approved striving to become technologically developed and competitive member of international relationships in the view of information era. Problem Statement. Most of patents issued in Ukraine do not provide profitability for patented technical solutions. Thus, effective commercialization of intellectual property rights is crucial on the way to the developed innovative economics of Ukraine. Commercialization of intellectual property rights is considered as the foundation for innovation process. Purpose. The purpose is to disclose the concept of commercialization of intellectual property rights. Materials and Methods. The concept and elements of intellectual property commercialization have been analyzed. Results. The commercialization of intellectual property rights is characterized by graduality, which is reflected in stages which are realized one after another. Conclusions. The following stages (elements) of commercialization of intellectual property have been identified: identification of the object of intellectual property and obtaining a security document, unless otherwise provided by law; marketing ( product identification, market analysis, sales channels, pricing, audit), which includes, in addition to the above promotion of the product /service using the object of intellectual property; valuation of intellectual property (cost method, market (comparative), income methods of valuation); intellectual property rights insurance; search for users and conclusion of agreements with them on exploitation of intellectual property rights. The research has focused on some types of agreements connected directly or indirectly with intellectual property: license, license agreement, assignment agreement, franchise agreement, non-disclosure (confidentiality) agreement, and collaboration agreement.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics
"The Role of Equity, Royalty, and Fixed Fees in Technology Licensing to University Spin-Offs",university technology transfer; equity; royalty; fixed fees; contract design; screening games; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTEGRATION; CONTRACTS; PATENTS; IMPACT,"We develop a model based on asymmetric information (adverse selection) that provides a rational explanation for the persistent use of royalties alongside equity in university technology transfer. The model shows how royalties, through their value-destroying distortions, can act as a screening tool that allows a less-informed principal, such as the university's Technology Transfer Office (TTO), to elicit private information from the more informed spin-off. We also show that equity-royalty contracts outperform fixed-fee-royalty contracts because they cause fewer value-destroying distortions. Furthermore, we show that our main result is robust to problems of moral hazard. Beside the coexistence result, the model also offers explanations for the empirical findings that equity generates higher returns than royalty and that TTOs willing to take equity in lieu of fixed fees are more successful in creating spin-offs.",2015,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
Antitrust Developments in Food and Pharma,agriculture; generic drug; antitrust; pay for delay; cooperatives; Capper-Volstead; Hatch-Waxman; ,"Closing the loopholes of downstream application of the Capper-Volstead exemption in the food system and pay for delay in pharmaceuticals is an important advance in US and EU antitrust norms. First, pay-for-delay conduct has been harmful for pharmaceuticals customers. After ten years of litigation that divided circuit courts, the Supreme Court decreed that payments to generic drug sellers by the patent holders of the brand equivalent that are aimed at delaying entry are illegal, but did so under a structured rule-of-reason approach. EU competition authorities treat such payments as per se civil infractions. Second, until court decisions made in 2011-2014, the reach of the Capper-Volstead Act and the legality of pay-for-delay conduct in the drug industry were in doubt. In 2015, most federal circuits now clearly agree that, at a minimum, acreage restrictions by marketing cooperatives are per se illegal. Moreover, any manipulation by farmers' cooperatives of upstream supply is also likely to be illegal.",2015,Agriculture; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
Policy Options for Infliximab Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Given Emerging Evidence for Switching,; HEALTH TECHNOLOGY-ASSESSMENT; NON-INFERIORITY TRIAL; CROHNS-DISEASE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; INNOVATOR INFLIXIMAB; CLINICAL-OUTCOMES; DOUBLE-BLIND; CT-P13; ANTIBODIES; THERAPY,"Biosimilars are becoming increasingly available internationally as patents expire on the originator biologic drugs they are intended to copy. Although substitution policies seen with generic drugs are being considered as a means to reduce expenditures on biologics, some biosimilars pose particular challenges in that the act of substitution may eventually lead to increased rates of therapeutic failure. As evidence requirements from regulators do not directly address this challenge, switch trials of biosimilars have emerged that may provide further answers. Using infliximab in inflammatory bowel disease as an example, we critically examine emerging evidence from two key switch trials (NOR-SWITCH and NCT020968610) and discuss the clinical and economic implications of these and what policy options may be most reasonable for payers. Options include reimbursing biosimilars for only newly diagnosed patients, using product-listing agreements to manage uncertainty, or using tiered co-payments or other incentives to promote biosimilar use.",2018,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services

University-industry joint research did not act as a conduit of university spillover, which suggested that informal channels, such as voluntary transfer of academic inventions in return to donation, worked in the pre-reform period.

Licensing versus assignment: Innovation transfer in an asymmetric duopoly,assignment; in-house exploitation; licensing; FIXED FEE; PATENT; SUPERIORITY; AUCTION,"Suppose that the relatively inefficient firm in an asymmetric duopoly market develops a nondrastic process innovation. To maximize returns on the innovation, the innovator must determine the most lucrative commercial policy. Should it be in-house exploitation, or licensing or assignment? It turns out that the innovator never uses innovation exclusively. The choice of licensing or assignment depends on the size of the initial cost difference. When the initial cost difference is relatively small, the innovator would resort to licensing, whereas when there is a significant initial cost gap, the innovator would rather assign the property rights of the innovation to the rival. In the case of assignment, the assignee may license the innovation back to the assignor. With the option of reverse licensing, an assignment will always be more profitable than (direct) licensing. Interestingly, if the initial cost gap were sufficiently large, the innovator would exit the market postassignment, and thus act as an outside nonoperating licensor.",2019,Business & Economics
Development of an auto-interchangeable multi-pinhole array for confocal laser scanning microscopy systems using precision laser processing,Confocal laser scanning microscopy; Laser micro-machining; Pinhole exchange; Imaging; Resolution; ,"Confocal laser scanning microscopy systems rely on a pinhole placed at the confocal point to act as a spatial filter. The diameter of the pinhole critically affects both the brightness and resolution of the imaging. Furthermore, different imaging conditions, such as sample type, depth of the sample, wavelength of the signal, and its inherent emission or reflection strength, require varying balances between the brightness and optical resolution for optimal observability. However, exchanging the pinhole, and its subsequent alignment, is often a time consuming challenge when implemented in customized systems. These systems are important since they are often used in studies for which commonly available ones lack sufficient capabilities. As such, we have developed an auto-positioning interchangeable pinhole array, manufactured via a patented laser machining process and designed for convenient implementation in confocal laser scanning microscopy systems and we demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility.",2019,Optics; Physics

EP 16461554.4) is related to a method of analysing a solid substrate by means of Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). It comprises the steps of providing a graphene layer over the substrate surface and analysing ejected secondary anions through mass spectrometry analysis. The graphene layer acts as a kind of filament that emits a lot of secondary electrons during the experiment which significantly increases the negative ionization probability and thus the intensity of the SIMS signal can be more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of a similar sample without graphene. The method is particularly useful for the analysis of surfaces, 2D materials and ultra-thin films. The intensity of dopants and contamination signals can be enhanced up to 35 times, which approaches the detection limit of similar to 10(15) atoms/cm(3), otherwise unreachable in a standard static SIMS analysis.",2017,Science & Technology - Other Topics

We hand collect unique datasets from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including drug patents, drug approvals, medical device approvals, and Phase I-II-III drugs under clinical testing. We find that higher institutional ownership has a positive, causal effect on firm innovation. We document that institutional ownership increases the number of FDA approved products. Then, we examine the innovation quality and find that institutional ownership reduces the likelihood of both drug recalls and market withdrawals. Our results investigate possible underlying mechanisms through which institutional investors provide faster and more frequent innovation outcomes: Institutional holdings act as active monitors by providing insurance for firm executives against innovation failures.

Intellectual property rights hinder sequential innovation. Experimental evidence,Innovation; Intellectual property; Laboratory experiment; Real effort task; Creativity; PATENTS; COMPETITION; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; PROTECTION; TIME,"In this paper we contribute to the discussion on whether intellectual property rights foster or hinder innovation by means of a laboratory experiment. We introduce a novel Scrabble-like word-creation task that captures most essentialities of a sequential innovation process. We use this task to investigate the effects of intellectual property allowing subjects to impose license fees on their innovations. We find intellectual property to have an adverse effect on welfare as innovations become less frequent and less sophisticated. Introducing communication among innovators does not reduce this detrimental effect. Introducing intellectual property results in more basic innovations, with subjects failing to exploit the most valuable sequential innovation paths. Subjects act more self-reliant and non-optimally in order to avoid paying license fees. Our results suggest that granting intellectual property rights hinders innovation, especially for sectors characterized by a strong sequentiality in innovation processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

THE COPY PROCESS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; FAIR-USE; INDEPENDENT INVENTION; PATENT; LAW; ECONOMICS; INNOVATION; DEFENSE; IP,"There's more than one way to copy. The process of copying can be laborious or easy, expensive or cheap, educative or unenriching. But the two intellectual property regimes that make copying an element of liability, copyright and trade secrecy, approach these distinctions differently. Copyright conflates them. Infringement doctrine considers all copying processes equally suspect, asking only whether the resulting product is substantially similar to the protected work. By contrast, trade secrecy asks not only whether but also how the defendant copied. It limits liability to those who appropriate information through means that the law deems improper. This Article argues that copyright doctrine should borrow a page from trade secrecy by factoring the defendant's copying process into the infringement analysis. To a wide range of actors within the copyright ecosystem, differences in process matter. Innovators face less risk from competitors if imitation is costly than if it is cheap. Consumers may value a work remade from scratch more than they do a digital reproduction. Beginners can learn more technical skills from deliberately tracing an expert's creative steps than from simply clicking cut and paste. The consequences of copying, in short, often depend on how the copies are made. Fortunately, getting courts to consider process in copyright cases may not be as far-fetched as the doctrine suggests. Black-letter law notwithstanding, courts sometimes subtly invoke the defendant's process when ostensibly assessing the propriety of the defendant's product.

Randomized controlled trial: hybrid technique using balloon dilation of the frontal sinus drainage pathway,frontal sinusotomy; balloon dilation; chronic rhinosinusitis; frontal sinusitis; functional endoscopic sinus surgery; CATHETER SINUSOTOMY; FOLLOW-UP; OUTCOMES; RHINOSINUSITIS; SURGERY; SAFETY; OSTIA,"BackgroundThe objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to evaluate frontal sinus ostial patency following balloon dilation with the Ventera (R) Sinus Dilation System, compared with frontal sinusotomy (Draf 2a); and (2) to compare mean blood loss and mean surgical time for frontal sinusotomy using balloon dilation compared with traditional surgical methods. MethodsA single blinded, randomized, controlled, prospective study was performed at St. Paul's Sinus Center, Vancouver, a tertiary referral rhinology center. Thirty patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were randomized to a hybrid approach with exposure of the frontal recess using standard instrumentation and then balloon dilation of 1 frontal sinus drainage pathway and traditional frontal sinusotomy for the opposite side. Blood loss and surgical time for opening the frontal sinus drainage pathway was recorded for each side. Patients acted as their own controls. Ostial patency and size were assessed 5 weeks and 3 months postoperatively using endoscopy. Ostial patency was also recorded at 1 year following surgery. ResultsAll frontal sinus ostia in both groups (n = 30) were successfully opened and were patent with both techniques 3 months postoperatively. All frontal sinus ostia assessed at 1 year (73%) remained patent and none required revision frontal surgery. Balloon dilation showed a mean surgical time of 655 seconds compared to 898 seconds for traditional FESS (p = 0.03). Mean blood loss was less with balloon dilation (58 mL vs 91 mL; p = 0.008). ConclusionA hybrid balloon technique successfully dilates the frontal sinus drainage pathway with reduced blood loss. Also, short-term patency appears to be comparable to traditional frontal sinusotomy.",2015,Otorhinolaryngology
System Pharmacology-Based Strategy to Decode the Synergistic Mechanism of Zhi-zhu Wan for Functional Dyspepsia,Zhi-zhu Wan; Zhishi; Baizhu; functional dyspepsia; therapeutic mechanism; system pharmacology; KAPPA-B; TARGET PREDICTION; WEB SERVER; PATHWAY; HESPERETIN; ASSOCIATION; NETWORK; DISEASE; KINASE; GENE,"Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a widely prevalent gastrointestinal disorder throughout the world, whereas the efficacy of current treatment in the Western countries is limited. As the symptom is equivalent to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) term stuffiness and fullness, FD can be treated with Zhi-zhu Wan (ZZW) which is a kind of Chinese patent medicine. However, the multi-component and multi-target feature of Chinese patent medicine makes it challenge to elucidate the potential therapeutic mechanisms of ZZW on FD. Presently, a novel system pharmacology model including pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacological data, and component contribution score (CS) is constructed to decipher the potential therapeutic mechanism of ZZW on FD. Finally, 61 components with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and biological activities were obtained through ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) screening in silico. The related targets of these components are identified by component targeting process followed by GO analysis and pathway enrichment analysis. And systematic analysis found that through acting on the target related to inflammation, gastrointestinal peristalsis, and mental disorder, ZZW plays a synergistic and complementary effect on FD at the pathway level. Furthermore, the component CS showed that 29 components contributed 90.18% of the total CS values of ZZW for the FD treatment, which suggested that the effective therapeutic effects of ZZW for FD are derived from all active components, not a few components. This study proposes the system pharmacology method and discovers the potent combination therapeutic mechanisms of ZZW for FD. This strategy will provide a reference method for other TCM mechanism research.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
An integrated solution for detecting rising technology stars in co-inventor networks,Rising technology stars; Co-inventor networks; Social potential; Technology performance; Innovation caliber; Tech mining; INNOVATION CAPABILITIES; RESEARCH PERFORMANCE; DETERMINANTS; INDUSTRIES; INDEX,"Online patent databases are powerful resources for tech mining and social network analysis and, especially, identifying rising technology stars in co-inventor networks. However, it's difficult to detect them to meet the different needs coming from various demand sides. In this paper, we present an unsupervised solution for identifying rising stars in technological fields by mining patent information. The solution integrates three distinct aspects including technology performance, sociability and innovation caliber to present the profile of inventor, meantime, we design a series of features to reflect multifaceted 'potential' of an inventor. All features in the profile can get weights through the Entropy weight method, furthermore, these weights can ultimately act as the instruction for detecting different types of rising technology stars. A K-Means algorithm using clustering validity metrics automatically groups the inventors into clusters according to the strength of each inventor's profile. In addition, using the nth percentile analysis of each cluster, this paper can infer which cluster with the most potential to become which type of rising technology stars. Through an empirical analysis, we demonstrate various types of rising technology stars: (1) tech-oriented RT Stars: growth of output and impact in recent years, especially in the recent 2 years; active productivity and impact over the last 5 years; (2) social-oriented RT Stars: own an extended co-inventor network and greater potential stemming from those collaborations; (3) innovation-oriented RT Stars: Various technical fields with strong innovation capabilities. (4) All-round RT Stars: show prominent potential in at least two aspects in terms of technical performance, sociability and innovation caliber.",2019,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science
Improving Respiratory Support Practices to Reduce Chronic Lung Disease in Premature Infants,; POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; CPAP; INTUBATION; OUTCOMES; RATES,"Introduction: We implemented a bundle of respiratory care practices and optimized delivery of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease (CLD) among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants born before 33 weeks gestation. Methods: Our multidisciplinary task force utilized 6 plan-do-study-act cycles to test our interventions. The primary outcome was the quarterly percentage of infants diagnosed with CLD; other outcomes included the percentage of infants initially managed with CPAP, intubation <72 hours of age, use of a nasal cannula, and days of ventilation, oxygen, and/or CPAP. Process measures included compliance with each of the 5 components of the bundle; balancing measures included mortality and complications of prematurity. Results: Demographics were similar in the 55 infants born before and 76 infants born after the task force interventions, except for gestational age, which was lower before. CLD decreased by 55.5% (from 37.5% to 16.7%). Quarterly percentage of infants requiring intubation decreased from 87.5% to 40.8%. Quarterly average days of ventilation decreased from 11.2 to 6.1, and days of supplemental oxygen declined from 44.1 to 25.4, while the use of CPAP increased. There were no differences in adverse events including mortality, pneumothorax, use of postnatal steroids, or any retinopathy of prematurity. The incidence of patent ductus arteriosus declined from 60% to 33% (P < 0.01). Conclusions: We reduced the incidence of CLD among our very low birth weight infants born before 33 weeks gestation by over 50% without increasing any measured adverse outcomes. The incidence of patent ductus arteriosus declined.",2019,Pediatrics
Transactions Within the Family: Coparenting Mediates Associations Between Parents' Relationship Satisfaction and the Parent-Child Relationship,family systems; marital; coparenting; parent-child relationship; toddlers; MARITAL CONFLICT; TRANSITION; QUALITY; FOUNDATIONS; PERCEPTIONS; ATTACHMENT; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; INFANCY,"In the current study, we examined the potential for transactional relations among patents' marital satisfaction, coparental cooperation and conflict, and parent-child relationship satisfaction in a sample of 249 families with 2-3-year-old children. Using a novel multiwave design with frequent assessments to better capture transactional family processes, mothers and fathers were assessed across 5 waves with 2-month lags; mean age of the target children (53% girls) was 2.8 years (SD = 0.62) at baseline. Cross-lagged, multilevel structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses using an actor-partner interdependence modeling framework revealed coparental cooperation and conflict as likely mechanisms within the family system. Specifically, marital satisfaction from both patents was reciprocally linked to fathers' coparental cooperation over time, supporting transactional links between those two family subsystems. In addition, there were significant transactional links between both mothers' and fathers' coparental cooperation and father-reported parent-child relationship satisfaction across time, revealing within-parent and cross-parent mediation. Regarding coparental conflict, marital satisfaction from both parents was reciprocally linked to the same parents' reports of coparental conflict across time (i.e., actor effects). Furthermore, father-reported coparental conflict acted as a mediating or intervening mechanism between father-reported marital satisfaction and mother-reported parent-child relationship satisfaction (cross-parent mediation). Taken as a set, the findings supported coparental cooperation and conflict as significant links between marital functioning and the parent-child relationship. Findings build on a growing body of literature addressing the transactional associations embedded within the family system and highlight the importance of modeling the inherent interdependencies between mothers' and fathers' reports of family functioning.",2018,Psychology; Family Studies
The generic drug user fee amendments: an economic perspective,prescription drugs; food and drug administration; regulation; supply; user fees; generic; ACT,"Since the vast majority of prescription drugs consumed by Americans are off patent ('generic'), their regulation and supply is of wide interest. We describe events leading up to the US Congress's 2012 passage of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA I) as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). Under GDUFA I, generic manufacturers agreed to pay approximately $300 million in fees each year of the five-year program. In exchange, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) committed to performance goals. We describe GDUFA I's FDA commitments, provisions, goals, and annual fee structure and compare it to that entailed in the authorization and implementation of GDUFA II on October 1, 2017. We explain how user fees required under GDUFA I erected barriers to entry and created scale and scope economies for incumbent manufacturers. Congress changed user fees under GDUFA II in part to lessen these incentives. In order to initiate and sustain user fees under GDUFA legislation, FDA requires the submission of self-reported data on generic manufacturers including domestic and foreign facilities. These data are public and our examination of them provides an unprecedented window into the recent organization of generic drug manufacturers supplying the US market. Our results suggest that generic drug manufacturing is increasingly concentrated and foreign. We discuss the implications of this observed market structure for GDUFA II's implementation among other outcomes.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine

GlaxoSmithKline and Theravance have developed an inhaled FDC of the ICS fluticasone furoate (FF) and the LABA vilanterol (VI) as a once-daily treatment for asthma and COPD. FF/VI, by simplifying the dosing schedule, allows, for the first time, a shift from twice-daily to once-daily treatment, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile that is consistent with the ICS/LABA class. The decision to prescribe FF/VI rather than another ICS/LABA FDC is likely to be based on the patient's preference for the inhaler device, their ability to use the device correctly and the convenience of once-daily dosing frequency as well as comparative costs with other combination products. However, further studies are required to specifically assess these possibilities.",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Drug Product Life-Cycle Management as Anticompetitive Behavior: The Case of Memantine,; ,"A product hop involves the substitution of a new formulation of a prescription drug by a pharmaceutical manufacturer for an old version to forestall generic competition. In 2015, for example, Forest Laboratories, the brand-name drug manufacturer of memantine, an Alzheimer's disease treatment, introduced an extended-release version and tried to restrict patient access to the previous version. Product hops can lead to useful incremental innovation but can also have major public health implications by disrupting patients on stable treatment regimens and increasing costs for patients and payers. This commentary reviews alleged anticompetitive product hopping in the case of memantine, which involved proposed conduct that would have left Alzheimer's disease patients with no effective choice but to transition to memantine XR. Policy solutions that can limit anticompetitive product hops include raising the bar for obtaining patents on new drug product formulations and changing automatic generic substitution laws.

Patenting nature or protecting culture? Ethnopharmacology and indigenous intellectual property rights,Epistemological pluralism; Ethnopharmacology; indigenous rights; intellectual property rights; traditional ecological knowledge; DRUG DISCOVERY; SOCIOCULTURAL PROBLEMS; GENETIC-RESOURCES; DEFINITION; MEDICINE; ACCESS; USAGE; LAW,"Ethnopharmacologists are scientists and anthropologists that study indigenous medicines and healing practices, and who often develop new therapies and medicines for wider use. Ethnopharmacologists do fieldwork with indigenous peoples in traditional societies, where they encounter a wide range of cultural values and varying ideas about the nature of property relations. This poses difficulties for protecting indigenous intellectual property and for making just trade agreements. This Note reviews the legal issues relevant to the protection of indigenous resources in ethnopharmacology trade agreements, and suggests that recent developments in anthropology and the social study of science could be instructive in furthering the legal discourse and in providing policy directions. Specifically, the Note introduces the concepts of 'ontological pluralism' and 'epistemic subsidiarity', which could help lawmakers write sui generis trade agreements to better protect indigenous knowledge and resources.",2016,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine
Intellectual property challenges for the roads of innovation in Brazil,Indicators; Intellectual property management; Performance Brazil; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; INCREASING RETURNS; RIGHTS,"Purpose - This paper aims to present reflections and points of interest on the performance of Brazil and highlight the advances and challenges in relation to the intellectual property (IP) system; the authors highlight some scientific, economic and technological indicators on the main IP objects registered in the National Industrial Property of Brazil (INPI). Design/methodology/approach - A structured literature reviews the main indicators of IP of Brazil (2013-2017), related to the scientific and economic factors more evidenced in the global scenario, with emphasis on the investment of national GDP in R&D activities, the allocation of resources from the government sector and private initiative, as in other emerging economies, such as the BRICS. Findings - Despite Brazil's progressive efforts to achieve greater efficiency in the public IP management system, GDP investment in R&D activities for 2019 is still below the OECD average of 2.3 per cent, and the IP indicators in the areas of patent registration, industrial designs and technology contracts have been declining. Research limitations/implications - Because of the difference between the laws of the countries on IP rights, the more incisive comparison could not be established among the emerging economies, highlighting the need for a standardization between the different international legislations. Originality/value - In the scientific field, this paper allows understanding the performance of the Brazilian IP system, and the categories that require greater investments, strengthen the IP culture and stimulate integration between the international IP systems, as it is a recurrent discussion in different research studies. Originally, the paper brought together economic and scientific indicators going beyond the traditional approach that deals with IP only restricting to the quantitative of patents.",2019,Business & Economics
From Transfer of Technology to Innovation Through Access,; COMPETITION,"While, in a traditional perception, IP law is all about protection and exclusivity, recent developments such as the strategic use of standard-essential patents (SEPs) present access rather than exclusion as a key driver for innovation. Although standardization generates important benefits to society it does also entail substantial risks such as the abuse of SEPs. From an analysis of important SEP-related practices it becomes evident that they constitute an important context in which a new demand for access to proprietary technology arises. When TRIPS is put to their litmus test, the result is double-edged. On the level of its fundamental provisions TRIPS cannot only accommodate the need for access. With its goal to balance the interests of technology owners and those who urge for a right to use protected technology TRIPS is even in the position to foster fair access. However, specific provisions on access requirements, such as Article 31 TRIPS on compulsory licenses, prove unsatisfactory. Until reform is brought about, the existing set of provisions must be read appropriately.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Intellectual property rights and cross-border mergers and acquisitions,Intellectual property rights; Cross-border mergers and acquisitions; PATENT PROTECTION; DETERMINANTS; INNOVATION; LAWS,"We investigate the role of intellectual property rights protection in cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. We document a significant increase in inbound cross-border M&As after a country implements reforms that strengthen local intellectual property rights. Importantly, we find that intellectual property rights have an impact on merger activity only in industries that are more intellectual capital-intensive, and when the target country has weaker intellectual property rights protection than the acquirer country. We also find that synergy gains in cross-border M&As are positively related to reforms of intellectual property rights. These results are consistent with the notion that acquirers are concerned about the local protection of intellectual capital when considering foreign acquisitions, and care the most when the target firm is in an industry that uses intellectual property intensely and in a country that has lesser-developed protections that their own country does.

We propose that client-led diversification results from a combination of the customer-driven opportunities emphasized in the demand-side view and the creation of added value through relational assets that is a central tenet of the relational view. Furthermore, we hypothesize that suppliers' client-specific knowledge, clients' relational commitment to suppliers, and growth opportunities in clients' markets (relative to the suppliers' own markets) will magnify the client-led diversification effect. We test our hypotheses using a longitudinal dataset on patent law firms and their diversification into new domains of patent prosecution work for their corporate clients. Managerial Summary: Explanations of why firms diversify into new lines of business have largely concerned the redeployment of underutilized resources, with little regard to opportunities or influences stemming from firms' existing customers. In our article, we show how the changing scope of business needs from a knowledge-based supplier firm's set of existing clients is a central driver of supplier-firm diversification, and this is especially the case when the level of relational assets shared between a supplier and its clients is higher. In a competitive landscape where suppliers compete intensively for the business of clients, our results show how managers can increase the likelihood of capturing additional business from its existing exchange relationships rather than bearing the risks of seeking new exchange relationships.",2018,Business & Economics
How will recent trade agreements that extend market protections for brand-name prescription pharmaceuticals impact expenditures and generic access in Canada?,Pharmaceutical policy; Globalization and health; Health care reform; Drug pricing; Health spending; International trade; Patents; Data exclusivities; Health law; EXCLUSIVITY; DRUGS; TIME,"Canada recently entered into two multinational trade agreements (i.e., the Canada, United States, and Mexico Trade Agreement: and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union). The resulting federal policy changes will prolong periods of market protection afforded to eligible brand-name prescription drugs by extending competition-blocking patent and data exclusivity terms. While previous studies have analysed these two policy changes in isolation, it remains unknown what the total combined impact will be in a typical year. Our objective was to design an analytic approach that can assess more than one change to a country's market protections and then to apply this methodology to the Canadian context. We find that the collective impact of these policy changes will be to extend the regulatory protection period for new drugs from an average of 10.0 years to 11.1 years. Depending upon the model's assumptions and all contingencies considered, an 11% increase equated to an average of $410 million annually (with a minimum estimate of $40 million and a maximum of $1.4 billion). Despite this uncertainty reflected in the range of possible financial impacts, we conclude that such methodological approaches could be useful for rapidly evaluating potential policy changes prior to adoption, which may further assist in budget planning to mitigate increased cost to the downstream health authorities most impacted by these trade concessions.

Lessons learned: a framework methodology for human rights impact assessment of intellectual property protections in trade agreements,Human rights; health; human rights impact assessment; intellectual property; international trade; affordable medicines; HEALTH; ACCESS; POLICY,"Currently, two billion people lack regular access to essential medicines in contradiction of their right to health under international law. With the rapid growth of intellectual property provisions in international trade agreements in recent years, governments are increasingly bound to provide stringent patent protection to pharmaceuticals, resulting in higher drug prices, which exacerbate the inaccessibility of medicines. As a result, there is a growing consensus in human rights and public health communities that policy-makers should ensure that trade agreements do not negatively affect the right to health, and moreover that human rights impact assessment offers a pragmatic and increasingly well-considered framework for achieving this aim. Drawing on numerous case studies and international human rights standards, this article proposes a pragmatic framework methodology for non-governmental organizations to carry out human rights impact assessment of trade-related intellectual property protections as part of their advocacy campaigns.",2016,Environmental Sciences & Ecology

This Article examines existing intellectual property legislation in Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt. Legislations in these three countries have agreed to subject to tax intellectual property revenues and activities, recognising them as one of the most important sources of state income. However, Palestinian legislation has not been clear in setting laws to deal with intellectual property revenues, contrary to counterparties in Egypt and Jordan.",2019,Government & Law
Anti-monopoly Cases on Unfair Pricing in China,; ,"Prohibition of unfair pricing is an area that has seen a growing number of enforcement activities in China. Unfair pricing, also called excessive pricing in some cases, is ruled under Article 17, Paragraph 1, of the Anti-Monopoly Law (AML), whereby dominant firms are prohibited to sell commodities at unfairly high prices or buy commodities at unfairly low prices. In this chapter, we will introduce the relevant legal framework and provide a review of recent typical cases. The major cases include the investigation against Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm) by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the landmark decision issued by the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court in Huawei v.

The results of the analysis-which are robust to controlling for the endogeneity of institutions-provide strong evidence of a link between the quality of government and the capacity of regions to innovate. In particular, ineffective and corrupt governments represent a fundamental barrier for the innovative capacity of the periphery of the EU, strongly undermining any potential effect of any other measures aimed at promoting greater innovation.

Activating Actavis in Europe - the proposal of a structured effects-based' analysis for pay-for-delay settlements,; ,"Striking the right balance between the protection of competition law and intellectual property rights is of utmost importance, especially in the pharmaceutical sector; affordable generic drugs are as important as new innovative drugs. Pay-for-delay settlements take place at exactly this intersection. They end patent infringement litigation but, at the same time, delay entry of generic drugs by means of a substantial payment from the brand company to the generic. Whereas the US Supreme Court opted for a rule of reason approach that requires an analysis of the potential anticompetitive effects, the European Commission regarded such settlements as restriction by object, finding an infringement without the need for an effects-based analysis. This approach is criticised and a novel structured effects-based' approach is proposed allowing the authority to effectively scrutinise such settlements while striking the right balance in order to protect the innovative process and the exercise of intellectual property rights.",2016,Government & Law

Based on the retrieval and analysis of technology patents in the water environment field, as well as the research on relevant competition policies, this paper indicates that China shall import and learn about related technologies from developed countries, such as the US and the EU. In addition, China ought to pay more attention to relevant EU competition policies.

Vibration control of a Stirling engine with an electromagnetic active tuned mass damper,ATMD; Active control; System modeling; Voice coil actuator; Real time; FPGA implementation; Relative and absolute feedback; ,"Active tuned mass damper (ATMD) systems have been used extensively to reduce vibrations in machines. The motivation of this study is attenuating the vibrations in a Free-Piston Stirling Engine/Linear Alternator (FPSE/LA) for a frequency band of 47-53 Hz using an electromagnetic ATMD that employs a linear Voice Coil Motor (VCM) for periodic excitation rejection. To the authors' knowledge, however several approaches to minimize vibrations in Stirling machines have been patented, the technique proposed in this research differs from other patented work by the simplicity of the proposed control law which aims to attenuate the engine vibrations at the fundamental operating frequency. The proposed control system features a zero-placement technique that utilizes both relative or absolute position and velocity feedback from the system response as well as a feedthrough measurement of the disturbance frequency that is used to determine the position gain online. The performance of the control system with the ATMD was evaluated both theoretically and experimentally. A test rig emulating the vibration behavior of the Stirling engine, featuring an electrodynamic shaker and an ATMD was developed and a model of the rig is presented and validated. A novel experimental procedure of identifying unknown stiffness and unknown dynamic mass of a spring-mass system is also presented. Similarly, another experimental procedure of determining the damping coefficient in the electromagnetic ATMD is shown. The implementation findings illustrate that the proposed active controller succeeds in broadening the attenuation band from 50 +/- 0.5 Hz to between 45 Hz and 55 Hz. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Measuring the systemic risk in interfirm transaction networks,Interfirm networks; Trade credit; Default propagation; AGGREGATE FLUCTUATIONS; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; PATENT CITATIONS; PROPAGATION; CREDIT,"Using a unique and massive dataset that contains information on interfirm transaction relationships, this study examines default propagation in trade credit networks and provides direct and systematic evidence of the existence and relevance of such default propagation. Not only do we implement simulations in order to detect prospective defaulters, we also estimate the probabilities of actual firm bankruptcies and compare the predicted defaults and actual defaults. We find, first, that an economically sizable number of firms are predicted to fail when their customers default on their trade debt. Second, these prospective defaulters are indeed more likely to go bankrupt than other firms. Third, firms that have abundant external sources of financing or whose transaction partners have such abundant sources are less likely to go bankrupt even when they are predicted to default. This provides evidence for the existence and relevance of firms - called deep pockets by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) - that can act as shock absorbers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Optimization of the catalyst deposition is described, including substrate characterization via contact angle, FTIR and surface charge measurement. The effects of the copper plating bath temperature and dwell time in the plating bath are examined. With plating times as short as 10 min, samples of good conductivity (sheet resistance, R = < 10 Omega/sq) and consistency were produced. A higher or lower plating temperature (compared to supplier recommended conditions) increased or reduced the amount of copper deposited, respectively.

When an Importer's Protection of IPR Interacts with an Exporter's Level of Technology: Comparing the Impacts on the Exports of the North and South,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PATENT RIGHTS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PANEL-DATA; INNOVATION; TRIPS,"Using bilateral trade data of countries from 2000 to 2007, this paper contributes to the empirical literature on the role of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in global trade. The existing literature has focused on how IPRs in the destination country affect exports from a source country. In this paper, we add an additional dimension: the level of technology of the exporting country (LT). This is quite important for distinguishing the impact of IPRs on the exports of developed and developing countries, since the technology levels vary across countries at different stages of development and intellectual property rights better protect exports that are technologically advanced than exports that are imitative and potentially infringing. By factoring in the level of technology (LT), our empirical analysis makes the case that IPRs can act as a barrier to the exports from the South, especially the rapidly catching-up economies, and thus be a source for the middle-income trap phenomenon.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations
Being a Catalyst of Innovation: The Role of Knowledge Diversity and Network Closure,innovation; social networks; catalysts; STRONG TIES; POWER; INVOLVEMENT; CENTRALITY; BROKERAGE; COHESION; SEARCH,"Whereas recent research on organizational innovation suggests that there is an ecology of roles supporting the innovation process, the majority of network research has concentrated on the role of inventors. In this paper, we contribute to research on organizational innovation by studying the social structural conditions conducive to individuals supporting, facilitating, and promoting the innovativeness of their colleagues-a role we refer to as catalysts of innovation. We consider an individual's network position and the type of knowledge available to her through her network as key enabling conditions. We argue that the unique configuration of having access to diverse knowledge through a closed network enables individuals to act as innovation catalysts. Based on a study of 276 researchers in the research and development division of a large multinational high-tech company, we find strong support for our prediction and demonstrate that catalysts make important contributions to the innovative outputs of other researchers in terms of their colleagues' patent applications.",2015,Business & Economics

Most of the prepared sulfonamides showed low inhibition against hCA I isoform, whereas the other cytosolic isoenzyme, hCA II, was strongly affected. The major part of these new derivatives acted as potent inhibitors of the tumor-associated isoform hCA XII. An opposite trend was observed for phenyl, naphthyl, and various heteroaryl substituted benzenesulfonamides which displayed subnanomolar hCA IX inhibition while poorly inhibiting the other tumor-associated isoform hCA XII. The inhibition potency and influence of the partially restricted arylaryl bond rotation on the activity/selectivity were rationalized by means of X-ray crystallography of the adducts of hCA II with several 4-arylbenzenesulfonamides.",2016,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
De-politicization and innovation: Evidence from China,; SARBANES-OXLEY ACT; POLITICALLY CONNECTED BOARDS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS; FIRM PERFORMANCE; FINANCE; PRIVATIZATION; CORRUPTION; GOVERNANCE; GOVERNMENT,"This study analyzes whether the loss of political connections in the Chinese listed firms affects their innovation. Using number of firm patents as a proxy for innovation, we construct a quasi-natural experiment, which focuses on independent directors with political connections were forced to resign due to CPC regulation in 2013 to explore the casual relation between political connections and firm innovation. The baseline results indicate that the innovation output has improved significantly since the promulgation of the Chinese government's policy in 2013. In addition, we also find two possible underlying channels that firms tend to increase R&D investments and prefer to hire more senior engineers as their independent directors once they lose political ties. The results suggest that de-politicization has been conducive to promoting technological innovation and firms will compensate for their competitiveness weakened by the loss of political connection through two underlying channels in China, which are also confirmed in additional robustness and placebo tests.

An accelerated growth model to generate complex networks with connectivity distribution slope that varies with time,Complex networks; scale-free networks; accelerated growth; Barabasi model; Krapivsky-Redner model; INTERNET,"Many real-life complex networks have in-degree and out-degree distributions that decay as a power-law. However, the few models that have been able to reproduce both of these properties, can not reproduce the wide range of values found in real systems. Another limitation of these models is that they add links from nodes which are created into the network, as well as between nodes already present in this network. However, adding links between existing nodes is not a characteristic available in all systems. This paper introduces a new complex network growth model that, without adding links between existing nodes, is able to generate complex topologies with in-degree and out-degree distributions that decay as a power-law. Moreover, in this growth model, the ratio at which links are created is greater than the ratio at which nodes are born, which produces an accelerated growth phenomenon that can be found in some real systems, like the Internet at the Autonomous System level. This model also includes a behavior in which the slope of the in-degree distribution changes as the network grows, in other words, it is a function of time. Similar behaviors have been previously observed in some real systems, like the citation network of patents approved in the US between 1975 and 1999. However, in this latter network, the slope of the out-degree decreases as the network grows.",2019,Physics
The Complexities of Biosimilars and the Regulatory Approval Process,; INTERCHANGEABILITY; EXTRAPOLATION; FDA; GUIDANCE; ONCOLOGY; SCIENCE; HURDLES,"Created via the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, the biosimilar class of drugs was conceived as an opportunity to introduce competition for commonly used biologics following loss of patent protection and market exclusivity, similar to the generic paradigm that has helped sustain access and innovation for more than 3 decades. The FDA approves a biosimilar after a manufacturer establishes that the product is highly similar to a previously approved originator biologic reference product without any clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. Given the concerns about increasing healthcare costs and this new opportunity to reduce the expense associated with biologics, including many commonly used oncology medications, the use of biosimilars will likely increase as numerous stakeholders, including managed care organizations, begin to implement policies to encourage adoption. As biosimilars are a relatively new class of drugs, clinical, scientific, and regulatory aspects continue to evolve and improve. Understanding those various aspects can improve clinician acceptance and advance the science of biologics and biosimilars. In this report, various factors are addressed to improve the knowledge of biosimilars, including clinical, manufacturing, and cost considerations.",2018,Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine
Maintaining lower limb access with the HeRO device,HeRO; Central vein stenosis; Central vein occlusion; Lower limb vascular access; HEMODIALYSIS; GRAFT; EXPERIENCE; PLACEMENT; OUTCOMES,"Central venous catheters (CVC) remain a mainstay of vascular access particularly for incident patients,but lead to central vein stenosis (CVS) in up to 1 in 6 patents. This often leads to establishing dialysis access in the groin which in turn may result in development of CVS in the lower body, although this is poorly reported. The HeRO device was designed to address CVS by bypassing the stenosed veins with a nitinol-reinforced silicone tube into the right atrium, which acts as an outflow conduit attached to an arterial inflow. The efficacy and safety of the HeRO device in the upper limb is well established, but there is no data on its use in the lower limb. We describe 2 cases of HeRO in the lower limb, one primary and one secondary, which remain in use. Lower limb HeRO is feasible in the lower limb and can work well either as de novo (to achieve vascular access) or as a salvage procedure (to maintain vascular access).",2019,Engineering; Transplantation

Most of these contain obligations on the protection and enforcement of IP that set significantly higher standards than those of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), commonly referred to as 'TRIPS-plus'. Human rights bodies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and academic commentators often criticise these standards for undermining flexibilities available under TRIPS. Such policy space, however, is critical to design national IP laws in accordance with domestic needs. This chapter makes a case for the continued relevance of the TRIPS Agreement as an overarching, multilateral framework. My argument is based on the role treaty law affords to the object and purpose expressed in Articles 7 and 8 TRIPS. They have not only been recognised as essential for promoting access to medicines in the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. As integral objectives and principles of TRIPS, Articles 7 and 8 limit the ability of World Trade Organization (WTO) Members to modify their IP-related treaty obligations inter se. Based on their negotiation history and common understandings expressed by WTO Members, I argue for an enhanced role of TRIPS' object and purpose as a loose constitutional frame for IP commitments in bilateral and regional treaties.",2018,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law

Panel estimation of the regional knowledge production function (1983-1996) revealed that university research had localised impacts on industrial innovations, measured by patents filed by the Japanese firms, with a five-year lag. University-industry joint research did not act as a conduit of university spillover, which suggests that informal channels, such as voluntary transfer of academic inventions in return to donation, worked in the pre-reform period. Intermediaries as a part of regional innovation policy, represented as local public technology centres, exerted a positive impact on industrial innovations in the region. Their immediate impacts suggest the contribution of technology diffusion, such as technical consultation, that help small local firms solve current problems while their far-reaching impacts suggest the importance of knowledge creation, such as own research.",2016,Business & Economics

Ballast water compliance monitoring: A new application for ATP,ATP 2G; Ballast Water Treatment; Compliance monitoring; Rapid methods; Water exchange; Bacteria; Zooplankton; Phytoplankton; VIBRIO-CHOLERAE,"The coming into force of the USCG ballast water regulations and the IMO ballast water management convention resulted in the development of several technologies approved for the treatment of ballast water. To ensure compliance of these technologies, the development of rapid and robust analysis methods was necessary. In collaboration with the SGS Group (Switzerland) and LuminUltra (Canada), Aqua-tools (France) has developed an innovative Ballast Water Treatment Monitoring (BWTM) kit for rapid onboard testing. The affordable kit provides results in less than 1 h, is easy to use and durable ensuring that the ballast water treatment system on the ship is fully compliant with the discharge standards upon arrival in port. The core of this method is a combination of high-quality reagents (lysis solution and ATP 2G Luminase (TM) enzyme) not inhibited by salinity and a patented fast homogenizing method for ATP extraction developed for a higher ATP recovery from zooplankton and phytoplankton. Compared to traditional analysis methods, the BWTM Kit provides fast and accurate results for all three fractions of microorganisms (>= 50 mu m, >= 10 + < 50 mu m and bacteria). Preliminary tests carried out in cooperation with SGS showed that the proposed method was able to detect onboard the efficiency of the treatment systems used. Compliance limits were established for all size fractions and a correlation between the standard methods (microscopy, plate count, MPN) and ATP was evaluated. The BWTM kit can provide a fast indication of compliance or gross exceedance. The rare borderline cases, when encountered, of course require additional confirmation.",2018,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography
Misuse of Artemisinin Combination Therapies by Clients of Medicine Retailers Suspected to Have Malaria Without Prior Parasitological Confirmation in Nigeria,ACT Misuse; Malaria Case Management in Africa; Test Before Treatment; Private Medicine Vendors; Presumptive Malaria Treatment; RAPID DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS; DRUG SHOPS; OVERDIAGNOSIS; CONSUMPTION; REDUCTION; TANZANIA; UGANDA,"Background: Prompt and effective case detection and treatment are vital components of the malaria case management strategy as malaria-endemic countries implement the testing, treating and tracking policy. The implementation of this policy in public and formal private sectors continue to receive great attention while the informal private retail sector (mostly the patent and propriety medicine vendors [PPMVs]) where about 60% of patients with fever in Nigeria seek treatment is yet to be fully integrated. The PPMVs sell artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) without prior testing and are highly patronized. Without prior testing, malaria is likely to be over-treated. The need to expand access to diagnosis in the huge informal private health sector among PPMVs is currently being explored to ensure that clients that patronize retail drug stores are tested before sales of ACTs. Methods: A cross-sectional multistage study was conducted among 1279 adult clients, 20 years and above, who purchased malaria medicines from 119 selected PPMVs in five administrative areas (States) of Nigeria, namely: Adamawa, Cross River, Enugu, Lagos and Kaduna, as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Exit interviews using a standard case report questionnaire was conducted after the purchase of the antimalarial medicine and thick/thin blood smears from the clients' finger-prick were prepared to confirm malaria by expert microscopy. Results: Of the 1279 clients who purchased malaria medicines from the PPMV outlets, 107 (8.4%) were confirmed to have malaria parasites. The malaria prevalence in the various study areas ranged from 3.5% to 16%. A high proportion of clients in the various study sites who had no need for malaria medicines (84%-96.5%) purchased and used antimalarial medicines from the PPMVs. This indicated a high level of over-treatment and misuse of antimalarials. Common symptoms that are widely used as indicators for malaria such as, fever, headache, and tiredness were not significantly associated with malaria. Nausea/ vomiting, poor appetite, chills, bitter taste in the mouth and dark urine were symptoms that were significantly associated with malaria among the adult clients (P < .05) but not fever (P = .06). Conclusion: Misuse of ACTs following overtreatment of malaria based on clinical diagnosis occurs when suspected cases of malaria are not prior confirmed with a test. Non-testing before sales of malaria medicines by PPMVs will perpetuate ACT misuse with the patients not benefiting due to poor treatment outcomes, waste of medicines and financial loss from out-of-pocket payment for unneeded medicines.",2018,Health Care Sciences & Services
Exploring pharmacological mechanisms of Xueshuan-Xinmai-Ning tablets acting on coronary heart disease based on drug target-disease gene interaction network,Traditional Chinese medicine; Chinese patent drug; Xueshuan-Xinmai-Ning tablet; Coronary heart Disease; Network pharmacology; Pharmacological mechanism; SMOOTH-MUSCLE CONTRACTION; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ANGIOGENESIS; DEPRESSION,"Background: Xueshuan-Xinmai-Ning Tablet (XXNT), a commercially available patent drug, has been extensively used in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) with a satisfying therapeutic efficacy. The aim of this study was to explore the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of XXNT acing on CHD. Study design: An integrative pharmacology-based investigation was performed. Method: Putative targets of composite compounds contained in XXNT were predicted using the Drug Target Prediction Tool in the Computation Platform for Integrative Pharmacology of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCMIP, www.tcmip.cn) and MedChem Studio. Then, an interaction network of XXNT putative targets-known CHD-related genes was constructed, and candidate XXNT targets related to its therapeutic effects on CHD were identified by calculating three major network topological features. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the specific functions and pathways involved by the candidate XXNT targets acing on CHD, which were further validated by in vitro experiments. Results: A total of 742 putative targets hit 126 chemical components contained in XXNT were predicted. Following the construction of XXNT putative target-known CHD-related gene network, and the network topological feature calculation, we identified 51 candidate XXNT targets related to its therapeutic effects on CHD. Functionally, these candidate XXNT targets were significantly associated with various cardiovascular system-related pathways, sedation-related pathways, inflammatory and immune-related pathways and endocrine/metabolic system-related pathways. More importantly, the in vitro experiment validation confirmed the regulatory effects of XXNT in SRC, VEGF and VEGFR-1, which play roles in VEGF signaling pathway, based on the endothelial injury cell model. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that XXNT may attenuate the major pathological changes of CHD through regulating its candidate targets, which might be involved into the signal transductions in nervous-endocrine-immune-cardiovascular-metabolic system.",2019,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine
Mechanistic framework predicts drug-class specific utility of antiretrovirals for HIV prophylaxis,; IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1; STEADY-STATE PHARMACOKINETICS; PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; PROTEIN-BINDING; VIRAL LOAD; IN-VIVO; INTRACELLULAR CONCENTRATIONS; HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION; PLUS RITONAVIR; INFECTION,"Currently, there is no effective vaccine to halt HIV transmission. However, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the drug combination Truvada can substantially decrease HIV transmission in individuals at risk. Despite its benefits, Truvada-based PrEP is expensive and needs to be taken once-daily, which often leads to inadequate adherence and incomplete protection. These deficits may be overcome by next-generation PrEP regimen, including currently investigated long-acting formulations, or patent-expired drugs. However, poor translatability of animal-and ex vivo/in vitro experiments, and the necessity to conduct long-term (several years) human trials involving considerable sample sizes (N>1000 individuals) are major obstacles to rationalize drug-candidate selection. We developed a prophylaxis modelling tool that mechanistically considers the mode-of-action of all available drugs. We used the tool to screen antivirals for their prophylactic utility and identify lower bound effective concentrations that can guide dose selection in PrEP trials. While in vitro measurable drug potency usually guides PrEP trial design, we found that it may over-predict PrEP potency for all drug classes except reverse transcriptase inhibitors. While most drugs displayed graded concentration-prophylaxis profiles, protease inhibitors tended to switch between none-and complete protection. While several treatment-approved drugs could be ruled out as PrEP candidates based on lack-of-prophylactic efficacy, darunavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine and rilpivirine could more potently prevent infection than existing PrEP regimen (Truvada). Notably, some drugs from this candidate set are patent-expired and currently neglected for PrEP repurposing. A next step is to further trim this candidate set by ruling out compounds with ominous safety profiles, to assess different administration schemes in silico and to test the remaining candidates in human trials.",2019,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Mathematical & Computational Biology

Three groups of crosses were made following North Carolina Mating Design II (NCII) including 12 NDSU, 24 ex-PVP lines, and seven current industry testers. Hybrids were planted in four different experiments at six ND environments following partially balanced lattice experimental designs in 2011 and 2012. Top heterotic patterns were selected based upon grain yield and other agronomic traits. Our research indicates most ex-PVP lines are genetically narrow and may not be immediately useful.

Is this scaling nonlinear?,scaling laws; statistical inference; allometry; ,"One of the most celebrated findings in complex systems in the last decade is that different indexes y (e. g. patents) scale nonlinearly with the population x of the cities in which they appear, i. e. y similar to x(beta), beta not equal 1. More recently, the generality of this finding has been questioned in studies that used new databases and different definitions of city boundaries. In this paper, we investigate the existence of nonlinear scaling, using a probabilistic framework in which fluctuations are accounted for explicitly. In particular, we show that this allows not only to (i) estimate beta and confidence intervals, but also to (ii) quantify the evidence in favour of beta not equal 1 and (iii) test the hypothesis that the observations are compatible with the nonlinear scaling. We employ this framework to compare five different models to 15 different datasets and we find that the answers to points (i)-(iii) crucially depend on the fluctuations contained in the data, on how they are modelled, and on the fact that the city sizes are heavy-tailed distributed.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics
"The Reception of Rene Lalique's Work in the United States, 1900-1940",; ,"This article discusses the arrival and reception of the works of the French artist and glass industrialist Rene Lalique (1860-1945) in the United States, based on important, recently discovered documents from the personal archive of his son-in-law, the well-known American photographer Paul Haviland (1880-1950), in Paris. It addresses the questions of how we should regard Lalique's art glass and to what extent industrial innovations, patent protection, and social circumstances played a role in his artistic developments. The article maps Lalique's quest for the creation of so-called modern industrial luxury. Topics covered in this assessment include Lalique's artistic developments in the pivotal period, about 1909, when his shift to glass was becoming unavoidable; his first all-glass presentation in the United States; and his activities during and after the war years (1914-1918). Thanks to a profusion of documents and additional finds, it is possible to provide a broader outline of Lalique the man, the artist, and the industrialist as well as the manner in which his output was regarded in the United States between 1900 and 1940.",2016,Art

COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE USE OF NEW STURGEON MIGRATION MONITORING SYSTEMS ON THE LOWER DANUBE,monitoring systems; receiver stations; sturgeons; ultrasonic transmitters; BEHAVIOR; FISH,"The hydrotechnical works (bottom sills, banks protections, and guiding wall) performed during 2011 -2017 period on the Danube river, between Calarasi and Braila (km 375-175), aimed to improve the fluvial navigation, and have imposed a continuous monitoring of biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The aim of these hydraulic works is to identify the possible negative effects which might appear and find the alternative solutions to eliminate the risks. The sturgeons, which are migratory species protected by Romanian law and closely monitored by international organizations, can be affected by these works, in the sense that the newly constructed bottom sills would prevent the migration to the breeding habitats. For the migration monitoring, ultrasonic receiver stations and ultrasonic transmitters developed by the Vemco Canada Company were used.

How to Create a Friendly Environment for Innovation? A Case for Europe,Friendly innovation environment; Social and political factors; European countries; Panel data analysis; ,"It is a misjudgement to assume that R&D subsidies, patent protections or alike are sufficient to promote innovation. In fact, innovations incubate and hatch within an environment, especially if it is a friendly one. The aim of this paper is to look for the major factors which are the building blocks or pillars of such an environment. After discussing and analysing the theoretical and empirical studies on the major social and political factors which are the likely constituents of our inquired environment, four major blocks or pillars appear to be the basic components on theoretical grounds. They are identified as the four different categories of inclusiveness, namely legal/regulatory, political and economic, social, and informatory. A model is developed by employing variables representing these four groups to measure and to analyse their impact on innovation. The model is tested by utilising the panel data of European countries. The results indicate that a favourable environment for innovation requires the existence of rule of law, gender equality, economic and political stability, and access to information.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Sociology
RECOGNIZING THE LIMITS OF ANTITRUST: THE ROBERTS COURT VERSUS THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES,; PATENT HOLDUP; CHICAGO,"In his seminal 1984 article, The Limits of Antitrust, Judge Frank Easterbrook proposed that courts and enforcers adopt a simple set of screening rules for application in antitrust cases, in order to minimize error and decision costs and thereby maximize antitrust's social value. Over time, federal courts in general-and the U.S. Supreme Court in particular, under Chief Justice Roberts-have in substantial part adopted Easterbrook's limits of antitrust approach, thereby helping to reduce costly antitrust uncertainty. Recently, however, antitrust enforcers in the Obama Administration (unlike their predecessors in the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton Administrations) have been less attuned to this approach, and have undertaken initiatives that reduce clarity and predictability in antitrust enforcement. Regardless of the cause of the diverging stances on the limits of antitrust, two things are clear. First, recent enforcement agency policies are severely at odds with the philosophy that informs Supreme Court antitrust jurisprudence. Second, if the agencies do not reverse course, acknowledge antitrust's limits, and seek to optimize the law in light of those limits, consumers will suffer.",2015,Business & Economics; Government & Law
Renouncing care in French Guiana: the national health barometer survey,Renouncing care; Health inequalities; Health system use; French Guiana; Health insurance coverage; RISK-FACTORS; INEQUALITIES; DETERMINANTS,"BackgroundIn French Guiana, health inequalities are patent for a broad range of pathologies for all age groups. The objective of the present study was to quantify the proportion of the population that had renounced care in the past year, to study predictive factors, and to compare results with other French territories.MethodsA two-stage random sample of 2015 individuals aged 15 to 75years was surveyed by telephone. A descriptive analysis of variables relative to renouncing care, use of health care, screening, and vaccination was initially performed. Multivariate analysis was then used to determine variables associated with renouncing care for financial reasons and renouncing for reasons linked to time were directly estimated using a Poisson model on weighted data. Variables with a significance level<0.2 in the bivariate analysis were included in the full multivariate model.ResultsIn French Guiana, during the past 12months, 30.9% of surveyed persons renounced care whatever the type for financial reasons. Results of the multivariate analysis showed that gender, perceived financial situation, perceived health and complementary insurance status were independent predictive factors of care renouncement for financial reasons. Overall, 24% of the surveyed population declared having renounced to care for time-related motives. The independent predictors for time-related renouncing were different than those for renouncing care for financial reasons: a higher education level and a poor perceived health were independently associated with time-related renouncement; retired persons and students were found to renounce care less frequently than persons with a job.ConclusionsRenouncing for financial reasons, a major target of the 2016 health law, represented a public health problem in French Guiana. Renouncing for lack of time was an important motive for renouncing, which is aggravated by the insufficient number of health professionals, but may benefit from organizational solutions. There are avenues for improvement of health for the most vulnerable: promote health, act on risk factors, and facilitate the readability and accessibility of the health system. Recent reforms to stabilize health insurance may however have some adverse consequences for migrants.",2019,Health Care Sciences & Services
How does the collaboration with dominant R&D performers impact new R&D employees' innovation performance in different cultural contexts?

Prior studies mostly examined the cultural influence in a general sense, but studies making a cross-cultural comparison especially in divergent work settings are rare. This study thus contributes to existing literatures by empirically testing the culturally implicit leadership theory in R&D activity with the patent co-inventing data of 51 Chinese and American firms. We find that compared with those in American firms, new R&D employees who act as subordinates in Chinese firms have stronger initiatives to collaborate with dominant R&D performers who act as leaders, while new R&D employees in American firms appear to be more indifferent to this relationship, even if they are aware that an earlier collaboration with dominant R&D performers is beneficial. In Chinese cultural context that is characterized by hierarchy and collectivism, this collaboration plays an inverted parabolic role in determining the new R&D employees' innovation performance from both quantitative and qualitative aspects.

Over the years, several structurally diverse ROR gamma t inverse agonists have been reported, but combining high potency and good physicochemical properties has remained a challenging task. We recently reported a new series of inverse agonists based on an imidazopyridine core with good physicochemical properties and excellent selectivity. Herein we report eight new X-ray crystal structures for different classes of natural and synthetic compounds, including examples selected from the patent literature. Analysis of their respective binding modes revealed insight into the molecular mechanisms that lead to agonism, antagonism, or inverse agonism. We report new molecular mechanisms for ROR gamma t agonism and propose a separation of the inverse agonists into two classes: those that act via steric clash and those that act via other mechanisms (for the latter, co-crystallization with a co-activator peptide and helix 12 in the agonist position is still possible). For the non-steric clash inverse agonists, we propose a new mechanism (water trapping) which can be combined with other mechanisms (e.g., close contacts with H479). In addition, we compare the interactions made for selected compounds in the back pocket near S404 and in the sulfate pocket near R364 and R367. Taken together, these new mechanistic insights should prove useful for the design and optimization of further ROR gamma t modulators.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Acting Injectable Paliperidone Palmitate Versus Haloperidol Decanoate in Maintenance Treatment of Schizophrenia,; RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER; ORAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; RELAPSE PREVENTION; OPEN-LABEL; RISPERIDONE; 2ND-GENERATION; UNCERTAINTY; OLANZAPINE; FRAMEWORK,"Objective: This study assessed the relative cost-effectiveness of haloperidol decanoate (HD), a first-generation long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic, and paliperidone palmitate (PP), a second-generation LAI antipsychotic. Methods: A double-blind, randomized 18-month clinical trial conducted at 22 clinical research sites in the United States compared the cost-effectiveness of HD and PP among 311 adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who had been clinically assessed as likely to benefit from an LAI antipsychotic. Patients were randomly assigned to monthly intramuscular injections of HD (25-200 mg) or PP (39-234 mg) for up to 24 months. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured by a schizophrenia-specific algorithm based on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and side-effect assessments; total health care costs were assessed from the perspective of the health system. Results: Mixed-model analysis showed that PP was associated with .0297 greater QALYs over 18 months (p=.03) and with $ 2,100 more in average costs per quarter for inpatient and outpatient services and medication compared with HD (p<.001). Bootstrap analysis with 5,000 replications showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PP of $ 508,241 per QALY (95% confidence interval=$122,390-$1,582,711). Net health benefits analysis showed a .98 probability of greater cost-effectiveness for HD compared with PP at an estimated value of $ 150,000 per QALY and a .50 probability of greater cost-effectiveness at $ 500,000 per QALY. Conclusions: HD was more cost-effective than PP, suggesting that PP's slightly greater benefits did not justify its markedly higher costs, which are likely to fall once the medication's patent expires.",2016,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Psychiatry"
An innovative approach to predict technology evolution for the desoldering of printed circuit boards: A perspective from China and America,Waste printed circuit board; desoldering; TRIZ; technology life cycle; ideal final result; TRIZ; STRATEGIES; RECOVERY; PATENTS; TRENDS,"The printed circuit boards basis of electronic equipment have seen a rapid growth in recent years and played a significant role in modern life. Nowadays, the fact that electronic devices upgrade quickly necessitates a proper management of waste printed circuit boards. Non-destructive desoldering of waste printed circuit boards becomes the first and the most crucial step towards recycling electronic components. Owing to the diversity of materials and components, the separation process is difficult, which results in complex and expensive recovery of precious materials and electronic components from waste printed circuit boards. To cope with this problem, we proposed an innovative approach integrating Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) evolution theory and technology maturity mapping system to forecast the evolution trends of desoldering technology of waste printed circuit boards. This approach can be applied to analyse the technology evolution, as well as desoldering technology evolution, then research and development strategy and evolution laws can be recommended. As an example, the maturity of desoldering technology is analysed with a technology maturity mapping system model. What is more, desoldering methods in different stages are analysed and compared. According to the analysis, the technological evolution trends are predicted to be the law of energy conductivity' and increasing the degree of idealisation'. And the potential technology and evolutionary state of waste printed circuit boards are predicted, offering reference for future waste printed circuit boards recycling.",2016,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
Experimental Investigations on the Basis for Intellectual Property Rights,intellectual property; copyright; patent; plagiarism; creative commons; DISREGARD INADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE; CHILDRENS RESPONSE; PIRACY; LAW; COPYCAT; NORMS,"Lay people routinely misunderstand or do not obey laws protecting intellectual property (IP), leading to a variety of (largely unsuccessful) efforts by policymakers, IP owners, and researchers to change those beliefs and behaviors. The current work tests a new approach, inquiring whether lay people's views about IP protection can be modified by arguments concerning the basis for IP rights. Across 2 experiments, 572 adults (recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk) read 1 of 6 arguments about the basis for IP protection (incentives, natural rights, expressive rights, plagiarism, commons, or no argument). Participants then reported their general support for IP protection. Participants also reported their evaluations of 2 scenarios that involved infringement of IP rights, including cases in which there were mitigating experiences (e.g., the copier acknowledged the original source), and completed several demographic questions. Three primary findings emerged: (a) exposure to the importance of the public commons (and to a lesser extent, exposure to the argument that plagiarism is the basis of IP protection) led participants to become less supportive of IP protection than the incentives, natural rights, expressive rights, and control conditions; (b) people believed that infringement was more acceptable if the infringer acknowledged the original creator of the work; and (c) older adults and women were especially likely to see infringement as problematic. These findings illustrate several ways in which lay beliefs are at odds with legal doctrine, and suggest that people's views about IP protection can be shaped in certain ways by learning the basis for IP rights.",2016,Government & Law; Psychology
CREATING A MORE CERTAIN STANDARD FOR ENHANCED PATENT DAMAGES BY REQUIRING EGREGIOUSNESS AS AN ELEMENT IN THE SECTION 284 ANALYSIS,; ,"According to 35 U.S.C. 284, district courts have the power to increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed by the jury in patent infringement cases where willful infringement occurred. Following the recent Supreme Court decision in Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc., it is now less clear how courts are to go about deciding whether to exercise this power. Halo established that the decision lies within the discretion of the district court judge, but declined to give a more concrete standard than urging the judge to take into account the particular circumstances of each case and only increase damages in egregious cases typified by willful misconduct. This Note proposes a new standard that is consistent with the Halo framework that will bring more certainty to enhanced damages decisions. Under this Note's proposed standard, before an award of enhanced damages can be made, the jury must find that infringement was willful, and the judge must find that the infringement was egregious under the standards established by the Federal Circuit. The egregiousness of the infringement is an explicit element that must be established before enhanced damages can be awarded. After these two elements are satisfied, the judge would have the discretion to award enhanced damages depending on the circumstances of the case. The egregiousness element is a mixed question of fact and law, so factual determinations made by the lower court are subject to clear error review and the overall legal determination of egregiousness is subject to de novo review by the Federal Circuit. This proposed standard would allow the Federal Circuit to reduce the uncertainty left by Halo, making it clear that egregiousness is required for every award of enhanced damages and providing a framework of specific factors district courts should weigh in making that determination.",2017,Government & Law

Does inflation cause growth in the reform-era China? Theory and evidence,Seigniorage revenue; R&D; Augmented Solow model; Instrumental variables estimation; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; MONEY GROWTH; TECHNOLOGY; PATENTS,"The government reaps seigniorage revenue from higher rates of money growth, hiring away more workers from entrepreneurs (the government crowding-out effect). There is also a positive seigniorage effect when part of the revenue goes to entrepreneurs, acting as a subsidy to R&D. When the government retains a larger share of the revenue, the government crowding-out effect dominates, and inflation retards growth. When entrepreneurs get the larger share, the seignior age effect dominates, and inflation increases growth. Both OLS (ordinary least squares) and IV (instrumental variable) regressions using time-series data during 1979-2014 in China show that differenced inflation (to ensure stationarity) has a significantly positive effect on growth. When we use the level of inflation, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in annual inflation would bring a 0.53 percentage point increase in annual growth of per worker real GDP. The robust, causal effect of inflation on growth in China provides support for our theory. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2016,Business & Economics

The plasmonic sensors are operated both in air and nitrogen environments, where they are irradiated with controlled doses of UVA radiation. AFM results don't reveal the formation of heterogeneous phases and crystallization under air exposure. The organic thin films change their refractive index under both types of exposure and act as a protective layer against oxidation for the SiO2/MPTS/metal interface of the plasmonic sensors. SPR measurements reveal a strict correlation between the refractive index increase and quenching of the photoluminescence of the organic thin films. The results are promising for the development of compact plasmonic UVA dosimeters in the surface plasmon coupled emission configuration (SPCE) with lanthanide beta-diketonate complex materials (patent pending).

Larger organizations with deep pockets can replicate the same business ideas used by startups with relative ease. So how does the average startup stand a chance at succeeding at this seemingly David vs. Goliath contest? This article looks at the available literature and identifies such factors that can affect the success of software development startups. Using causal loop constructs from the field of system dynamics, the interactions among the various identified factors are visualised to reveal the dynamics of the system. The result is as a three-dimensional view of success factors in form of time, capital and (product) differentiation. The modelled system is then simulated, and the resultant trend is reviewed and interpreted.

We hypothesize that, when the above mechanisms are not available, firms are more likely to fragment processes across multiple foreign production units instead of collocating all process tasks in the same unit. Thanks to IT-enabled integration capabilities, firms can exploit the complementarities between the dispersed fragments of a process while reducing the misappropriation hazard of individual fragments. Empirical results and robustness tests are strongly congruent with these hypotheses. We find also that the propensity to turn to the process fragmentation protection mechanism increases with firm host-country-specific experience and with the alternative value of the proprietary information involved in the activity sourced abroad.",2016,Business & Economics
ASSESSING US GLOBAL TAX COMPETITIVENESS AFTER TAX REFORM,tax reform; corporate income taxation; multinational corporations; INVESTMENT INCENTIVES; POLICY,"This paper assesses the impacts of the 2017 tax reform act on US. competitiveness in terms of changes in incentives for US. domestic corporate investment and the taxation of US.-headquartered companies and their foreign subsidiaries relative to foreign-headquartered companies. The reduction of the US. statutory tax rate has significantly improved domestic investment incentives as measured by marginal and average effective tax rates, assuming an average use of debt and equity. In addition, the partial adoption of a participation exemption system in some cases can allow US companies now to compete globally on equal tax terms with foreign-headquartered companies. However, a new US. global minimum tax imposes current taxation on certain foreign income previously eligible for deferral and, as a result, may disfavor US. ownership of high-return foreign assets relative to foreign-headquartered companies. Average effective tax rates are also reduced by a new domestic incentive for undertaking high-return investments in the United States. Even so, US. research incentives continue to lag behind those available in many other major countries, taking into account special deductions, tax credits, and patent box regimes.",2018,Business & Economics
Therapeutic Potential of GPR 120 Agonists for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes,; ,"The invention in this patent application relates to isothiazole and thiophene derivatives represented generally by formula (I), which are GPR120 agonists and may potentially be useful for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, obesity-related disorders, impaired oral glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance. Statistics have shown that current drug therapies for Type 2 diabetes are lacking durable efficacy. More than half of patients on current oral medications fail to reach the targeted blood glucose control after 5 years of treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need for new drug therapies to treat Type 2 diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) is a member of the glucagon receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is a key regulator of glucose homeostasis, which is secreted by the L-cells in the colon following meals. It is an incretin hormone that potentiates insulin secretion, reduces glucagon secretion, preserves beta-cell function, and improves satiety. GLP-1 has been a therapeutic target for several of the recently approved Type 2 diabetes drugs including Januvia (Merck) and Galvus (Novartis), which act by prolonging the half-life of GLP-1, and Byetta (Amylin), which acts by activating the GLP-1 receptor. The complex pathology of free fatty acids (FFAs) plays a key role in the progression of diabetes. While the acute exposure of FFAs in the pancreas and the colon stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion and GLP-1 release, chronic exposure of FFAs impairs insulin secretion and becomes toxic to beta-cells. The accumulation of FFAs in insulin responsive tissues such as muscles and liver causes tissue insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia in the liver has been linked to increased accumulation of fatty acids and hepatic glucose output, which cause impaired insulin resistance and create a vicious cycle of disease progression. Currently available Type 2 diabetes drugs can only treat some of the damaging effects of FFAs on the progression of diabetes. Therefore, researchers are aiming to develop effective new therapies that can address all or most of these effects to efficiently potentiate the release of GLP-1, significantly improve blood glucose control, maintain beta-cells function, and may additionally be capable of treating obesity. G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) is a member of the rhodopsin family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which also includes GPR40, GPR41, and GPR43. GPR120 is expressed predominantly in the intestine and adipose tissue and functions as a receptor for long chain FFAs. It is activated by unsaturated long chain FFAs, which stimulate the secretion of GLP-1. It is believed that GPR120 signaling activates Ca2+ flux as well as protein kinase C (PKC), which may explain how FFAs contribute to the release of GLP-1 in the L-cells. While GPR120 is not yet very well studied, available data suggest that GPR120 agonists would potentiate insulin secretion and reduce glucagon indirectly via GLP-1 release. The beneficial effects of elevating GLP-1 levels are already well documented in clinical studies. Thus, GPR120 presents a potentially viable therapeutic target to develop novel treatments for Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. GPR120 agonists such as the compounds described in this patent application may be effective in improving glucose homeostasis and can potentially treat obesity. They might additionally act as complementary treatments to existing diabetes therapies that affect liver insulin sensitivity and those that preserve beta-cells function.",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
DRAMP: a comprehensive data repository of antimicrobial peptides,; ANTIBACTERIAL PEPTIDES; GENERATION; TOOLS,"The growing problem of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms results in an urgent need for substitutes to conventional antibiotics with novel modes of action and effective activities. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), produced by a wide variety of living organisms acting as a defense mechanism against invading pathogenic microbes, are considered to be such promising alternatives. AMPs display a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and a low propensity for developing resistance. Therefore, a thorough understanding of AMPs is essential to exploit them as antimicrobial drugs. Considering this, we developed a comprehensive user-friendly data repository of antimicrobial peptides (DRAMP), which holds 17349 antimicrobial sequences, including 4571 general AMPs, 12704 patented sequences and 74 peptides in drug development. Entries in the database have detailed annotations, especially detailed antimicrobial activity data (shown as target organism with MIC value) and structure information. Annotations also include accession numbers crosslinking to Pubmed, Swiss-prot and Protein Data Bank (PDB). The website of the database comes with easy-to-operate browsing as well as searching with sorting and filtering functionalities. Several useful sequence analysis tools are provided, including similarity search, sequence alignment and conserved domain search (CD-Search).

They were adopted by the HGP at a strategy meeting in Bermuda in February of 1996 and implemented in formal policies by early 1998, mandating daily release of HGP-funded DNA sequences into the public domain. The idea of daily sharing, we argue, emanated directly from strategies for large, goal-directed molecular biology projects first tested within the community of C. elegans researchers, and were introduced and defended for the HGP by the nematode biologists John Sulston and Robert Waterston. In the C. elegans community, and subsequently in the HGP, daily sharing served the pragmatic goals of quality control and project coordination. Yet in the HGP human genome, we also argue, the Bermuda Principles addressed concerns about gene patents impeding scientific advancement, and were aspirational and flexible in implementation and justification. They endured as an archetype for how rapid data sharing could be realized and rationalized, and permitted adaptation to the needs of various scientific communities. Yet in addition to the support of Sulston and Waterston, their adoption also depended on the clout of administrators at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the UK nonprofit charity the Wellcome Trust, which together funded 90% of the HGP human sequencing effort. The other nations wishing to remain in the HGP consortium had to accommodate to the Bermuda Principles, requiring exceptions from incompatible existing or pending data access policies for publicly funded research in Germany, Japan, and France. We begin this story in 1963, with the biologist Sydney Brenner's proposal for a nematode research program at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) at the University of Cambridge. We continue through 2003, with the completion of the HGP human reference genome, and conclude with observations about policy and the historiography of molecular biology.",2018,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; History & Philosophy of Science
BITPROPERTY,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LIABILITY RULES; LAW; COPYRIGHT; PRIVACY; RIGHTS; CYBERSPACE; TRAGEDY; PLACE; MONEY,"Property is the law of lists and ledgers. County land records, stock certificate entries, mortgage registries, Uniform Commercial Code filings on personal property, copyright and patent registries of interests in intellectual property, bank accounts, domain name systems, and consumers' Kindle e-book collections in the cloud are all merely entries in a list, determining who owns what. Each such list has suffered a traditional limitation. To prevent falsification or duplication, a single entity must maintain the list, and users must trust (and pay) that entity. As a result, transactions must proceed at significant expense and delay. Yet zero or near-zero transaction costs are the fuel of Internet scalability. Property transactions have not yet truly undergone an Internet revolution at least partly because they are constrained by the cost of creating centralized trusted authorities. This Article reimagines the contours of digital property if that central constraint were removed. There is every reason to believe it can be. Increased interest in cryptocurrencies has driven the development of a series of technologies for creating public, cryptographically secure ledgers of property interests that do not rely on trust in a specific entity to curate the list. Previously, the digital objects that users could buy and sell online were not rivalrous in the same way as offline physical objects, unless some centralized entity such as a social network, digital currency issuer, or game company served the function of trusted list curator. Trustless public ledgers change this dynamic. Counterparties can hand one another digital, rivalrous objects in the same way that they used to hand each other gold bars or dollar bills. No intermediary or curator is needed. In addition, the advent of this technology provides an opportunity to discuss property interests in information environments. Property online is currently anemic. Consumers control few online resources and own even fewer. This is in no small part due to antiquated notions of property as the law of physical, tangible resources. Given new technology that can create digital, scarce, and rival intangible assets, these basic assumptions should be reexamined and replaced with a theory of property as an information communication and storage system. That is the project of this piece.",2015,Government & Law
Public Relations Litigation,; REPUTATION; LEGAL; COMMUNICATION; DEFAMATION; DISCLOSURE; CONTRACTS; DISCOURSE; CRISIS; LAW,"Conventional wisdom holds that lawsuits harm a corporation's reputation. So why do corporations and other businesses litigate even when they will likely lose in the court of law and the court of public opinion? One explanation is settlement: some parties file lawsuits not to win but to force the defendant to pay out. But some business litigants defy even this explanation; they do not expect to win the lawsuit or to benefit financially from settlement. What explains their behavior? The answer is reputation. This Article explains that certain types of litigation can improve a business litigant's reputation in the eyes of its key constituents-constituents that help it succeed in the marketplace. It is their changed views of the litigant-and subsequent actions taken based on those changed views-that provide the financial benefit from a lawsuit that the court may not deliver. For example, technology companies use patent litigation to discourage employee flight, consumer products companies may use litigation to affect consumers' opinions about competitors, and some corporate plaintiffs may even use litigation to address reputational harm following a crisis. In all these examples, business litigants may benefit from the reputational effects of the litigation even if they lose in court. This Article makes two contributions. Descriptively, it challenges the conventional wisdom that lawsuits are always bad for business by revealing hidden incentives found outside the courthouse that are neglected in the standard explanation for litigant behavior. Specifically, it explains how litigation can contribute to reputation-building through signaling or framing strategies. It also describes how this reputation-building can result in different types of distributed gains: interparty, intertemporal, and interinstitutional. Practically, it highlights that the legal rules that could address this reputation-building may lack utility due to the timing of reputational effects in litigation.",2019,Government & Law

Editing the genome of plants and/or animals has been a rather controversial component of all EU policies on agricultural biotechnology since the late 1980s. The chapter examines in detail the various initiatives that have been assumed for the regulation of gene editing at the EU level. Since the first political and legislative attempts, the field has been revolutionized with the development of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which is comparatively much easier to design, produce, and use. Beyond the pure, safety-driven scientific questions, gene editing, in its contemporary form, raises a series of ethical and regulatory questions that are discussed in the context of the legal options and competences of the EU legislators. Special attention is paid to questions about the legal status of gene editing in Europe and the adequacy of the current GMO framework to deal with all the challenges associated with the latest scientific developments in the field of gene editing with a special focus on gene drive. Given the ongoing discussions regarding the ethical tenets of gene editing, the chapter investigates the question on whether there is a need to shape an EU-wide intervention that will address the complex and dynamic socio-ethical challenges of gene editing and puts forward a series of proposals for the framing of an inclusive framework that will be based on the need to re-enforce public trust in the EU governance of emerging technologies.",2019,"Social Sciences - Other Topics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
Disruptive developments in document recognition,Optical character recognition; Document analysis; Forms processing; Semantic web; ,"Progress in optical character recognition, which underlies most applications of document processing, has been driven mainly by technological advances in microprocessors and optical sensor arrays. Software development based on algorithmic innovations appears to be reaching the point of diminishing returns. Research results, dispersed among a dozen venues, tend to lag behind commercial methodology. Some early main-line applications, like reading typescript, patents and law books, have already become obsolete. Check, postal address, and form processing are on their way out. Open source software may open up niche applications that don't generate enough revenue for commercial developers, including poorly-funded transcription of historical documents (especially genealogical records). Smartphone cameras and wearable technologies are engendering new image-based applications, but there is little evidence of widespread adoption. As document contents are integrated into a web-based continuum of data, they are likely losing even the meager individuality of discrete sheets of paper. The persistent need to create, preserve and communicate information is giving rise to entirely new genres of digital documents with a concomitant need for new approaches to document understanding.

From a dataset of 5498 manufacturing firms in Italy for the period of 2000-2008, longitudinal fixed effects quantile models are estimated, in which the firm's age is set to moderate the effects of green and non-green patents on employment growth. We find that the positive effect of green technologies on growth is greater than that of non-green technologies. However, this result does not apply to struggling and rapidly growing firms. With fast-growing (above the median) firms, age moderates the growth effect of green technologies. Inconsistent with the extant literature, this moderation effect is positive: firm experience appears important for the growth benefits of green technologies, possibly relative to the complexity of their management.",2019,Business & Economics

These are fascinating subjects, but they also have many ethical, legal and social implications. In the following pages, we will firstly clarify essential theoretical and practical concepts for interpreting and understanding the aspects of the investigation. Then, using some practical and illustrative examples, we will try to explain some of the most challenging issues at the intersection of law, science and technology. In particular, we will illustrate the deep interrelation between science, technology and legal protection of individual rights.",2016,Government & Law
Harnessing Polypharmacology with Computer-Aided Drug Design and Systems Biology,Polypharmacology; systems biology; docking; computer aided drug design; natural language processing; FDA-APPROVED DRUGS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; ELECTROSTATIC SIMILARITY; MULTITARGET-QSAR; DUAL INHIBITORS; BINDING-SITE; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; NETWORK,"The ascent of polypharmacology in drug development has many implications for disease therapy, most notably in the efforts of drug discovery, drug repositioning, precision medicine and combination therapy. The single-target approach to drug development has encountered difficulties in predicting drugs that are both clinically efficacious and avoid toxicity. By contrast, polypharmacology offers the possibility of a controlled distribution of effects on a biological system. This review addresses possibilities and bottlenecks in the efficient computational application of polypharmacology. The two major areas we address are the discovery and prediction of multiple protein targets using the tools of computer-aided drug design, and the use of these protein targets in predicting therapeutic potential in the context of biological networks. The successful application of polypharmacology to systems biology and pharmacology has the potential to markedly accelerate the pace of development of novel therapies for multiple diseases, and has implications for the intellectual property landscape, likely requiring targeted changes in patent law.",2016,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
"The Pay-Twice Critique, Government Funding, and Reasonable Pricing Clauses Georgia State University, College of Law Journal of Legal Medicine Symposium",; INNOVATION,"The federal government subsidizes the research and development of prescription medications. Thus, a captivating critique of expensive medications is that prices are too high because of taxpayer co-financing. This critique is often framed in terms of paying-twice-first for the research and second through the above market pricing of resulting products. Reasonable pricing clauses-which place some kind of pricing limitation on the exercise of license or patent rights governing a federally funded medication-are one proposed policy tool for addressing the pay-twice critique. This article provides increased analytical clarity as well as historical context to present-day debates about the privatization of federally funded research and prescription drug pricing. It makes three arguments. First, despite its pervasiveness and intuitive plausibility, the pay-twice critique is subject to differing interpretations which has important implications for the appropriateness of proposed solutions. Second, despite their initial attractiveness, the costs, necessity, and effectiveness of reasonable pricing clauses render the wisdom of this policy tool uncertain. However, third, given continued interest in reasonable pricing clauses, the NIH's previous experience with such a policy offers some useful lessons.",2019,Government & Law; Biomedical Social Sciences
"Malaria Knowledge and Treatment Practices in Enugu State, Nigeria: A Qualitative Study",Knowledge of Malaria; Treatment Practices; Qualitative Study; Enugu State; Nigeria; PATENT MEDICINE VENDORS; RURAL-AREAS; MANAGEMENT; PROVIDERS; SERVICES; PATTERN,"Background: Malaria accounts for 60% of outpatient visits in Nigeria. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge of malaria and its treatment practices in Enugu state, Nigeria. Methods: Qualitative data was collected through the use of focus group discussions (FGDs), from six villages three each from urban and rural areas of Enugu state, Nigeria. A total of 18 FGDs involving 189 participants were conducted and data on place of treatment for malaria and drug of choice for malaria treatment were collected. Results: Most discussants had a good knowledge of the signs and symptoms of malaria. They reported late for treatment when they had symptoms suggestive of malaria. Treatment timing was affected by financial capability and perceived severity of disease. There was preference for patent medicine dealers (PMDs) and pharmacies for malaria treatment. The reasons included drug affordability, obtaining preferred drug, short waiting time and polite treatment from the providers. Treatment in most cases was without proper malaria diagnosis. Cost was an important factor in determining the drug of choice for malaria treatment. This could explain why people were not aware of the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy while preferring mono-therapies and herbal drugs. Public hospitals were considered as good sources of treatment for malaria although they remain the last resort when treatment from these drug outlets failed. Conclusion: The community members preferred PMDs and pharmacies for malaria treatment. Unfortunately, these drug outlets do not encourage the use of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). This makes it necessary that pharmacists and PMDs are trained on management of malaria. Also, improving the knowledge of the public on the need for malaria diagnosis before treatment and use of artemisinin-based combination therapy will improve the control of malaria. The populace should be instructed to seek treatment early while also discouraging the use of herbal drugs for malaria treatment. There is also the need to improve service delivery at public health facilities.",2018,Health Care Sciences & Services
Unified economic ideas and their hybrid policies: the case of Swedish life science innovation work,Economic ideas; science logic; market logic; life science innovation; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT EVIDENCE; VALUE RELEVANCE; EARNINGS; CAPITALIZATION; DETERMINANTS; MODELS; CHOICE; IMPACT; SIZE,"Institutional theory describes organisations as being open to external influences, including policy-making. Policy-making is in turn based on normative ideas that inform how markets and economies unfold. Policies may include wide-ranging concerns and trade-offs (as in science and industry policy) or may be detailed and specific (as in the case of, e.g. procurement policies in the medical technologies sector), but they tend to play a role in shaping markets. A study of the Swedish life science innovation field suggests that the policy shift in life sciences governance to what Berman [2008. 'Why Did Universities Start Patenting? Institution-building and the Road to the Bayh-Dole Act.' Social Studies of Science 38:835-871] names a market logic. In the present case, the market logic is not sufficiently supported by favourable market conditions, leading to a 'hybrid logic' enforcing an enterprising ethos but otherwise remains couched within a bureaucratic innovation system not providing critical resources conducive to life science innovation - venture capital funds and commercial human resources. The outcome is arguably case of 'over-entrepreneurialisation'.",2018,Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics

These sulfonamides were investigated as inhibitors of the human carbonic anhydrase (hCA, EC 4.2.1.1) isoforms hCA I and II (cytosolic isozymes), as well as hCA IX and XII (trans -membrane, tumor-associated enzymes). They acted as medium potency inhibitors of hCA I (K(1)s of 81.0-3084 mu M), being highly effective as hCA II (K(1)s in the range of 0.25-10.8 nM), IX (Kis of 3.7-50.4 nM) and XII (Kis of 0.60-52.9 nM) inhibitors. These compounds should thus be of interest as preclinical candidates in pathologies in which the activity of these enzymes should be inhibited, such as glaucoma (CA II and XII as targets) or some tumors in which the activity of three isoforms (CA II, IX and XII) is dysregulated.

When technology's value is not observable, innovators with more valuable technology disclose their private information to receive a fair payment despite a rival's earlier challenge, whereas the owner of less valuable technology reveals nothing. We show that the more valuable technology is and the less bargaining power the innovator has, the more information the innovator discloses. This finding is consistent with empirical evidence on inventors' disclosure strategy after the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA). Furthermore, we show that despite the information disclosure, innovators make R&D investment earlier than they would have under symmetric information. This is in contrast with conventional wisdom that the need to disclose complementary information may retard innovation, and can be explained by the interaction between the decisions of investment timing and information disclosure. Though the leading innovator suffers losses from information asymmetry, the total value of the firms in the market may increase due to the diffusion of knowledge. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Several top-down technologies are available in the market for generation of nanocrystals. Despite several advantages, very few bottom-up technologies have been explored for commercial purpose. This short communication highlights a novel, bottom-up, spray drying based technology-NanoCrySP-to generate drug nanocrystals. Nanocrystals are generated in the presence of non-polymeric excipients that act as crystallization inducer for the drug. Excipients encourage crystallization of drug by plasticization, primary heterogeneous nucleation, and imparting physical barrier to crystal growth. Nanocrystals have shown significant improvement in dissolution and thereby oral bioavailability. NanoCrySP technology is protected through patents in India, the USA, and the European Union. NanoCrySP can be utilized for (i) pharmaceutical development of new chemical entities, (ii) differentiated products of existing molecules, and (iii) generic drug products. The aggregation of drug nanocrystals generated using NanoCrySP poses significant challenges in the nanocrystal-based product development. Addition of stabilizers either during spray drying or during dissolution has shown beneficial effects.",2016,Instruments & Instrumentation; Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Since chemical control on zucchini is complicated by a limited availability of registered chemicals, as well as by the scalar harvest, a number of resistance inducers, organic amendments, biocontrol agents and fungicides were tested against P. capsici, under greenhouse conditions. Experiments were carried out at the nursery level, with different timing and number of applications. In the presence of a very high disease pressure, the best disease control was provided by mefenoxam, followed by the phosphite-based products, which acted as resistance inducers and also provided a positive effect on plant biomass. Acibenzolar-S-methyl, although effective, was sometimes phytotoxic. The biocontrol agents tested as well as the patented formulation of Brassica carinata defatted seed meals were not effective, providing results statistically similar to the untreated control. The efficacy of resistance inducers is interesting in view of their possible use in alternation with chemicals, or as stand-alone treatments in cultivation systems which do not adopt chemical control.",2015,Agriculture; Plant Sciences; Entomology
α-Glucosidase Inhibitor Isolated from Blechum pyramidatum,Blechum pyramidatum; alpha-Glucosidase inhibition; Kinetic analysis; Docking analysis.; PLANTS,"Blechum pyramidatum (Lam.) Urb. is a species of extensive medicinal use in the American continent. In fact, antidiabetic and anticancer preparations from this plant have been patented in Mexico, even though their active constituents are not yet known. It was recently discovered that B. pyramidatum inhibits the action of the a-glucosidase enzyme, thereby corroborating the antidiabetic properties attributed to this plant. The primary purpose of this study was to identify and characterize the a-glucosidase inhibitors from this species. Bioassay-guided fractionation of a crude extract of B. pyramidatum led to the isolation of a main alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, Palmitic acid (IC50 237.5). This compound was identified by both spectroscopic and spectrometric analysis. Its inhibitory activity was similar to that of the antidiabetic drug acarbose (IC50 241.6 mu M), which was used as a positive control in our bioassay. Kinetic analysis established that palmitic acid acted as a competitive inhibitor. Docking analysis predicted that this compound binds to the same site as acarbose does in the human intestinal a-glucosidase (PDB: 3TOP). The presence of palmitic acid in B. pyramidatum and its potent inhibitory activity against a-glucosidase enzyme provides solid evidence to support the antidiabetic use of this plant in traditional medicine.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Food Science & Technology

The main therapeutic approach is based on immediate administration of an ache reactivator as an antidote enabling recovery of the ache function. Areas covered: This review covers the development of AChE reactivators in order to introduce a new efficient drug that will overcome significant failures of common antidotes. Further options together with methods of detection are also discussed in order to assure a complete insight into the treatment of intoxication. Expert opinion: Since organophosphates belong to the most toxic chemical warfare agents, efficient antidotes are a matter of importance. The solution of how to limit the basic drawbacks of clinically used reactivators remained a spotlight for many researches worldwide. Recent strategies of the treatment of OP exposure bring us new possibilities which may overcome classic antidotes. The importance of detection of OP also has to be taken into consideration.

Innovation and imitation as an interactive process,Imitation innovation; Lotka-Volterra system; intellectual property; dynamic uncertainty; real option; DYNAMIC COMPETITION ANALYSIS; LOTKA-VOLTERRA EQUATIONS; PATENT LIFE; DIFFUSION; MARKET; OPTIONS; POLICY,"This article deals with the problem of the coexistence of innovators and imitators in a competitive market. The study proposes a model of innovation and diffusion of productive knowledge as an interactive process between innovators and imitators under conditions of dynamic uncertainty. The process can be modelled as a Stackelberg game, where the innovator acts as a leader in choosing whether to share knowledge or set up private protection and the imitator as a follower in choosing when becoming active. Under these conditions, activation thresholds are derived for both innovators and imitators. If protection policies are effective, the imitator can be trapped into an inaction region by the innovator. Thus, there will be two regimes without and with diffusion, according to whether the inaction region is enacted or not. Under these conditions, discovery and diffusion appear to be dynamic complements, as a higher speed of activation of innovating firms is favoured by a higher level of imitation and a higher speed of activation of imitating firms is favoured by a higher level of discoveries. In order to explore some of the quantitative implications of these results, the paper also proposes an application of the model to four European countries.",2016,Business & Economics
HOW NOT TO LOSE VALUABLE KNOW-HOW IN AN INDUSTRY?,industrial enterprises; know-how; acquisition and loss of knowledge; ,"Know-how belongs to the intangible assets of enterprises. They are defined as information consisting of verified in practice technical knowledge and skills in goods trade (which are not covered by patents) allowing the entrepreneur to achieve a competitive advantage. Intangible assets are currently the key resource of enterprises, within which innovative competencies are included. They are not visible in the balance sheets of companies, they do not grow in proportion to property investments and do not yield to ownership. They have a spatial dimension of a special character, and they create the intellectual capital of the organisation, which along with the acquired knowledge, using active growth factors, can gain the ability to process innovations and act towards the development of the organisation. However, this is not always the case, hence, the attempt to answer the question of how not to lose valuable know-how in an industry. The conducted surveys among enterprises providing services for the industry have shown that they have innovative potential. This means that not only the industry and its development may affect the service sector and its performance, but the reverse - the service sector may influence the demand of the industrial sector. The article presents the potential for innovation growth with the employees' own knowledge.",2019,Transportation
The economic impact of biosimilars in Italy: a scenario analysis,Biosimilari; costi; anti-TNF; BUDGET IMPACT; INFLIXIMAB,"Background: the first generation of biotechnology drugs is reaching, or has already reached, the patent expiry and a large number of biosimilars is entering the Italian pharmaceutical market. The objective of the analysis was to evaluate the economic impacts of biosimilars on the national health expenditure in Italy between 2014 and 2020. Methods: Based on the information deriving from consumption per standard unit and equivalent patients, it was estimated monthly expenditure for some of the biological drugs currently available in Italy that have had or will have a patent expiry within the analysis period (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, insulin glargine, trastuzumab, rituximab, bevacizumab and insulin aspart). Pharmaceutical expenditure was calculated on hospital sales prices net of transparent discounts required by law and visible from the AIFA database. Three alternative scenarios have been developed based on the perceptions of a board of clinical experts, pharmacologists and pharmacoeconomists involved in the study. The experts involved analyzed the estimates of treated patients between 2014 and 2017 and reports their hypothetical biosimilar penetration during the period 2018-2020. The results were represented as the difference between the estimated expenditure in the absence of biosimilars and the estimated expenditure in the presence of biosimilars with the real or hypothetical biosimilar penetration. Results: considering the standard units dispensed for each year, the economic model estimate an annual expenditure in 2014 equal to euro 1.47 billion for the molecules considered in the analysis. These estimates rise to euro 1.54, euro 1.50 billion and euro 1.51 billion during 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the scenario without biosimilar introduction. Biosimilar introduction generates cost savings between euro 3.8 million in 2015 and euro 32.9 million in 2017 if compared with the scenario without. Assuming an increasing biosimilar penetration between 2018 and 2020, scenario analysis estimates a cumulative cost reduction equal to euro 597 million. Conclusions: Overall, biosimilar penetration generates important cost reduction that could be re-invested in the National Health Sistem.",2019,Health Care Sciences & Services

Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) allow effective and safe eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in most patients. There are limited data on the long-term effects of all-oral, interferon-free DAA combination therapies in kidney transplant (KT) patients infected with HCV. Here we evaluated the long-term tolerability, efficacy, and safety of DAA combination therapies in KT patients with chronic HCV infection. Methods. Clinical data from KT patients treated with DM were collected before, during, and after the treatment, including v sponse, immunosuppression regimens, and kidney and liver function. Results. Patients (N = 226) were mostly male (65.9%) aged 56.1 +/- 10.9 years, with a median time from KT to initiation of DAA therapy of 12.7 years and HCV genotype 1b (64.6%). Most patients were treated with sofosbuvir-based therapies. Rapid virological response at 1 month was achieved by 89.4% of the patients and sustained virological response by week 12 by 98.1%. Liver function improved significantly after DAA treatment. Tacrolimus dosage increased 37% from the beginning of treatment (2.5 +/- 1.7mg/d) to 1 year after the start of DAA treatment (3.4 +/- 1.9 mg/d, P < 0.001). Median follow-up was 37.0 months (interquartile range, 28.4-41.9) and death-censored graft survival was 91.1%. Adverse events resulting from DAA treatment, especially anemia, were reported for 31.0% of the patients. Conclusions. Chronic HCV infection can be treated efficiently and safely with DM therapy in KT patents. Most patients retained stable kidney function and improved liver function. Tacrolimus dose had to be increased in most patients, potentially as a result of better liver function.",2019,Transplantation
Does the political will exist to bring quality-assured and affordable drugs to low- and middle-income countries?,Trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS); intellectual property rights and patents; annual originator and generic HIV drug cost estimates; low-and middle-income countries; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; HIV; ACCESS,"Background: Increased coverage with antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries has increased their life expectancy associated with non-HIV comorbidities and the need for quality-assured and affordable non-communicable diseases drugs . Funders are leaving many middle-income countries that will have to pay and provide quality-assured and affordable HIV and non-HIV drugs, including for non-communicable diseases. Objective: To estimate costs for originator and generic antiretroviral therapy as the number of people living with HIV are projected to increase between 2016 and 2026, and discuss country, regional and global factors associated with increased access to generic drugs. Methods: Based on estimates of annual demand and prices, annual cost estimates were produced for generic and originator antiretroviral drug prices in low- and middle-income countries and projected for 2016-2026. Results: Drug costs varied between US$1.5 billion and US$4.8 billion for generic drugs and US$ 8.2 billion and US$16.5 billion for originator drugs between 2016 and 2026. Discussion: The global HIV response increased access to affordable generic drugs in low- and middle-income countries. Cheaper active pharmaceutical ingredients and market competition were responsible for reduced drug costs. The development and implementation of regulatory changes at country, regional and global levels, covering intellectual property rights and public health, and flexibilities in patent laws enabled prices to be reduced. These changes have not yet been applied in many low- and middle-income countries for HIV, nor for other infectious and non-communicable diseases, that lack the profile and political attention of HIV. Licensing backed up with Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights safeguards should become the norm to provide quality-assured and affordable drugs within competitive generic markets. Conclusion: Does the political will exist among policymakers and other stakeholders to develop and implement these country, regional and global frameworks for non-HIV drugs as they did for antiretroviral drugs?",2019,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
Updated trends in US brand-name and generic drug competition,Prescription drugs; Generic drugs; Pharmaceutical economics; Economic competition; Market exclusivity; ACT,"Objective: To provide updated evidence on US trends in: market exclusivity periods (MEPs, time between brand-name drug launch and first generic competitors) for new molecular entities (NMEs); likelihood, timing and number of Hatch-Waxman Act Paragraph IV patent challenges; and generic drug penetration. Methods: This study used IMS Health National Sales Perspectives (TM) US data to calculate MEPs for the 288 NMEs experiencing initial generic entry between January 1995 and December 2014, the number of generic competitors for 12 months afterward (by level of annual sales prior to generic entry), and generic penetration rates. The likelihood, timing and number of Paragraph IV challengers were calculated using data from Abbreviated New Drug Approval (ANDA) letters, the FDA website, public information searches, and ParagraphFour.com. Results: For drugs experiencing initial generic entry in 2013-2014, the MEP was 12.5 years for drugs with sales greater than $250 million (in 2008 dollars) in the year prior to generic entry ($250 million+NMEs), 13.6 years overall. After generic entry, brands rapidly lost sales, with their average unit share being 7% at 1 year for $250 million+NMEs, 12% overall. Ninety-four percent of $250 million+NMEs experiencing initial generic entry in 2013-2014 had faced at least one Paragraph IV challenge, an average of 5.2 years after brand launch (76% and 5.9 years for all NMEs). NMEs faced an average of 5.1 and 6.2 Paragraph IV challenges per NME, for all and $250 million+NMEs, respectively. Limitations: Analyses, including Paragraph IV calculations, were restricted to NMEs where generic entry had occurred. Conclusion: The average 2013-2014 MEP of 12.5 years for $250 million+NMEs, 13.6 overall remains consistent with prior research. MEPs are lower, and Paragraph IV challenges are more frequent and occur earlier for $250 million+drugs. Generic share erosion is also greater, and continues to intensify for both NME types.",2016,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine
"Fascist Revolution, Futurist Spin: Renato Bertelli's Continuous Profile of Mussolini and the Face of Fascist Time",; ,"Emerging from relative obscurity, the young sculptor Renato Bertelli (1900-1974) made his mark with one of the most widely disseminated portraits from Fascism's twenty-year rule. The Continuous Profile of Mussolini (1933) renders its subject in the round, such that the Duce's visage appears redoubled from nearly any angle. Patenting the design almost immediately, Bertelli set about mass-producing it in a range of sizes and materials-a reproducibility which resulted in a striking assortment of owners throughout the twentieth century, from Mussolini's son-in-law to the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Seemingly throbbing yet utterly still, the sculpture conjures up the gyration of some mechanical contrivance and-equally apparent to an Italian public-millennial depictions of the Roman god Janus. Bertelli's design elides the duality intrinsic to Janus's representation, however; its circular grooves at once nullify and exploit the very principal of dialectical time. It thus serves as both an allegory of Fascism's self-styled permanent revolution and a synthesis of the regime's cultural paradoxes as embodied in the Duce. For all its commercial success and latter-day visibility, however, the sculpture garnered almost no contemporary critical responses. This article traces the overdetermined origins of Bertelli's sculpture, from various aesthetic precedents to less explicit allusions.",2019,Art

At the end of 2015, a French NGO accused researchers from the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD) of biopiracy. These researchers had applied for a patent for a natural bioactive molecule against malaria and cancer, the Simalikalactone E, isolated from Quassia amara L. (Simaroubaceae) leaves. This biopiracy allegation triggered a huge wave of attacks from the media and social networks, and vehement recrimination from political officials in French Guiana against researchers who have been accused of ethical misconduct, by stealing the traditional knowledge of indigenous people. These accusations were made in the contentious context of the ratification of the Nagoya Protocol in the frame of implementing the French law on biodiversity, nature and landscapes. So, in an atmosphere of heightened emotions it is crucial to understand the issues behind these accusations.

Intellectual Property Policy Strategies for Sustainable Manufacturing in India,IP strategy; Sustainable manufacturing; Business strategy; ,"Sustainability has become the buzzword in recent times. While manufacturing leads to considerable advantages like contributing to the GDP, providing goods and services for consumer, and generating employment opportunities, it is also contributing to the detriment of the environment and the natural resources, which run counter to the philosophy of sustainability. In order to achieve sustainability in manufacturing, substantial investments have to be made towards innovation, which can be protected under the intellectual property regime. But the IP rights prevent others from copying the technology, which is antithesis to the concept of sustainable manufacturing. Companies need to be aware of the IP policy of India, which facilitates the protection of environment and the natural resources. Also, India as a country needs to relook at the IP strategies available to ensure that it has sufficient access to technology, which can help in the proliferation of sustainable manufacturing technologies. This chapter provides for two levels of strategies, both relating to IP rights, which can be adopted by India, in order to achieve sustainable manufacturing in the country. The first level is the IP policy strategies that can be adopted by India, in light of the international treaties like TRIPS, the WTO system, as well as other treaties, conventions and protocols. The second level is the IP strategies that can be adopted by the non-governmental sector including the private commercial sector as well as the academic sector (both public funded as well as private funded). While the former analyses the TRIPS agreement and tries to understand how the objectives stipulated therein have been captured by the Indian IP legislations, the latter looked at strategies like investing towards R&D, licensing of technology, patent pools and copyright collectives, open source and open innovations, and also government initiatives that could ensure the implementation of sustainable manufacturing technology in India.",2018,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics
Trade secrets in Spain: protection and connection with intellectual property rights,trade secrets; intellectual property rights; unfair competition; misappropriation; disclosure; use; felony; Spanish legal system; ,"Intangibles constitute nowadays the most precious value for companies worldwide, enabling them to be settled as intellectual property rights or as trade secrets, on which this article focuses. On the one hand, this article takes a broad legal approach to their presence in the Spanish legal system, showing that they provide two types of protection: a civil protection, through the Unfair Competition Law, and a criminal protection, through the Criminal Code, which includes criminal responsibility for legal persons. Each of these two types of protection has particular features, but they are almost identical, as they punish, although with different legal consequences, the same actions against trade secrets. On the other hand, the purpose of this paper is also to explore the connection between trade secrets and intellectual property rights, specifically patent rights. Both kinds of intangibles share many aspects and the international legal instruments confirm it, but their main difference is the instrument of protection: while intellectual property rights receive protection through their registration, trade secrets have to be safeguarded through specific measures adopted by their holder in order to keep their confidentiality. From this difference others are derived, but, despite their existence, they work as supplementary systems.",2016,Government & Law
Mind the Gap! How the Digital Turn Upsets Intellectual Property,Intellectual property rights; Copyright; Digital information; File sharing; Social norms; Nirvana fallacy; LAW; PIRACY; RIGHTS; LABOR,"Intellectual property is one of the highly divisive issues in contemporary philosophical and political debates. The main objective of this paper is to explore some sources of tension between the formal rules of intellectual property (particularly copyright and patents) and the emerging informal norms of file sharing and open access in online environments. We look into the file sharing phenomena not only to illustrate the deepening gap between the two sets of norms, but to cast some doubt on the current regime of intellectual property as an adequate frame for the new type of interactions in online environments. Revisiting the classic Arrow-Demsetz debate about intellectual property and the epistemological issues involved in assessing institutions, we suggest that seeking out new institutional arrangements aligned with the norms-in-use seems to be a more promising strategy in the new technological setting than attempting to reinforce the current legal framework.

As a secondary task, we try to cast some doubt on the two most common moral justifications of intellectual property as being able to ground the full extent of the current intellectual property regime.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Engineering; History & Philosophy of Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Philosophy
Intellectual Property and Consolidation in the Seed Industry,; ,"Intellectual property protections on seeds have increased dramatically in recent decades, from the granting of patent-like protections on certain types of seeds in 1970 to the enforcement of contract provisions for seeds beyond the first sale in 2013. During this same period, the seed industry has experienced rapid consolidation. Although as recently as the 1970s, it was characterized by thousands of small, mostly family-owned business, by 2011, just three agrochemical firms controlled more than half of the global proprietary seed market. These trends have resulted in rapidly increasing prices for commodity seeds and reduced farmers' ability to save seeds. Given these important negative impacts, why do these trends continue? Expanding intellectual property protections and reducing the number of competitors are strategies that the largest firms understandably employ to increase their power but government support has also been essential to their success. Policy changes have reduced the enforcement of antitrust laws and increased the enforcement of alleged intellectual property infringements. In addition, synergies between stronger intellectual property protections and consolidation have further reinforced the dominance of top firms at the expense of a freely competitive industry. A better understanding of these trends is unlikely to reverse them in the near term but may increase the effectiveness of creating alternatives to a seed oligopoly.",2015,Agriculture
Public private partnerships and emerging technologies: A look at nanomedicine for diseases of poverty,Public private partnership; Emerging technologies; Nanotechnology; Diseases of poverty; Inclusive innovation; PERSPECTIVES; HEALTH,"Emerging technologies, like nanotechnology, are often hailed as transformative technologies that will not only help the rich, but be used to decrease poverty and inequality. In order to overcome many of the challenges associated with developing products for poor communities, especially medicines for the poor, institutions setup organizations called public private partnership (PPPs). This study examines whether PPPs are developing nanotechnology to make medicines for diseases of poverty (DoP). PPPs are the main actors researching medicines for DoP and if they are not involved with nanotechnology research, then it is unlikely that nanomedicines for DoP will be developed. Through interviews and website content analysis, this study finds that there are only a few PPPs doing nanomedicine research. Many of the PPPs are worried that the technology is too expensive and it will take too long to bring nanomedicines to the market. To increase the likelihood that emerging technologies, like nanotechnology, will be used to mitigate poverty, policy makers can do several things like change the patent laws to encourage innovation on technologies for the poor, increase research funding in areas that address development, and move pro-poor technologies quickly through the regulation process.

However, the results of actions taken to achieve sustainability often lie far into the future and efforts to promote the welfare of distant generations may or may not ultimately be successful. While both governmental policies and entrepreneurial innovation have been cited as being indispensable to the achievement of sustainability, the manner in which they co-exist and interact over very long periods of time remains unclear. Using a computational model spanning more than two centuries, this study asks: Do well-intended environmental policies facilitate or inhibit environmental entrepreneurship? By simultaneously considering both the ethical and economic consequences of efforts to arrest environmental degradation, our study answers the call to develop multi-disciplinary perspectives and integrative frameworks when addressing the challenges of sustainable existence. Contrary to widely held perceptions, our findings suggest that policy actions may, in the long run, result in less intergenerational fairness by crowding out environmentally desirable innovations and organizations. Our examination of the long-term interactions between policies and markets offers insights and opportunities for scholars, entrepreneurs, environmentalists, ethicists and policymakers to develop solutions that preserve and extend the essential contributions of both policy actions and entrepreneurial innovations.",2016,Business & Economics
Employment growth heterogeneity under varying intellectual property rights regimes in European transition economies: Young vs. mature innovators,Employment growth; Intellectual property rights; Innovative youngsters; Transition economies; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; FIRM GROWTH; GIBRATS LAW; SIZE; BEHAVIOR; AGE,"Young innovative companies are supposed to be key drivers of sustainable economic growth. This study examines the employment growth of young, small innovative firms (denoted as innovative youngsters) and contrasts it with the employment growth of established 'mature innovators' in 23 European transition economies, where varying degrees of intellectual property protection apply. The growth figures of the two firm groups vary significantly across different intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes. Innovative youngsters seem to benefit from strong intellectual property protection, while mature innovators exhibit the highest employment growth rates when IPRs are rather weak. These findings point to important undiscovered differences in employment growth patterns, which might explain some of the ambiguous results of former research on IPRs, and provide a reason why certain countries might benefit from strong IPRs while others might not.

AND Gate Response in a Double Mesoscopic Ring,AND gate; double mesoscopic ring; transmission probability; I-V characteristic; shot noise; magnetic flux; quantum interference effect; ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; QUANTUM-DOT; NOISE,"Background: Normal metal mesoscopic rings are being used in designing quantum logical gates due to the quantum interference effect and quantum confinement. This study focused on examining electronic transport through normal metal mesoscopic rings that have one dimension, and suggested how such rings can be employed to design nanoscale AND gate. A double mesoscopic ring was utilized for AND gate operation, every ring was threaded by magnetic flux, and the magnetic flux was considered as the key tuning parameter in the AND gate action. For a particular value of magnetic flux equal to the half of elementary flux-quantum, a logical AND gate operation was used depending on the applied gate voltages. Two gate voltages were externally applied to the lower arm of every ring, which acted as the two inputs of the AND gate. Few relevant patents to the designing and fabrication of quantum logical gates have been reviewed and cited. Methods: All the calculations are based on the time-dependent Hamiltonian model, the steady state is used to obtain the transmission probability. Results: The transmission probability, the current and the noise power of current fluctuations were calculated in the weak-coupling and strong-coupling regimes. Conclusion: This study paved the way for the production of an electronic logic gate.",2017,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics
Mitigation of Aerodynamic Uplift Loads Using Roof Integrated Wind Turbine Systems,wind turbine; Wall of Wind; wind load; low-rise building; wind energy; roof uplift; hazard mitigation; BUILDINGS; PRESSURES; PARAPETS; DAMAGE,"Coastal areas of the US are affected by extreme wind events, including hurricanes. Roofs are the most vulnerable building components as they are often damaged by high wind uplift forces acting on the edges and corners. This study investigates the application of a mitigation strategy, in the form of an Aerodynamics Mitigation and Power System (AMPS) (US Patent, Gan Chowdhury et al., Patent Number: US 9,951,752 B2, April 2018), designed to simultaneously reduce wind damage and provide power to buildings. The system consists of horizontal axis wind turbines, integrated to roof edges with or without gutters. Four sets of testing on a flat roof low rise building model (without gutters)-including a bare deck configuration (i.e. without AMPS) and three cases where the roof corner was fitted with AMPS-were conducted at the Wall of Wind Experimental Facility at Florida International University. In one of the configurations, the wind turbines were placed slightly above the roof edge, while in the other two configurations, the turbines were placed closer to the roof edge. Wind directions tested ranged from 0 degrees to 90 degrees (considering roof geometric symmetry). Estimation of area-averaged mean and peak pressure coefficients were made for various locations on the roof for the three different configurations, and compared with the case of no mitigation. Results show that for wind directions tested, significant reduction in mean and peak pressure coefficients (reduced suction) were obtained in those cases where the wind turbines were placed closer to the roof edge as compared to the bare roof deck case. Flow visualization studies showed that the turbines helped to disrupt the conical vortices caused by cornering winds, thereby reducing the wind uplift forces on the roof. This study shows that the AMPS can be utilized to prevent wind-induced damage to the roof. Future research will include estimation of the: (1) potential wind energy production using the mitigation system under various wind conditions, (ii) effectiveness of AMPS in mitigating wind loading on other kinds of buildings (e.g., gable and hip roof buildings), and (iii) load transferred from the system to the roof.",2019,Construction & Building Technology; Engineering
Experimental study of cross-flow wet electrostatic precipitator,; DEMONSTRATING PROMISE; PARTICULATE CONTROL; FINE; PERFORMANCE,"This paper reports development and testing of a novel cross-flow wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP), recently patented at Ohio University, that utilizes vertical columns of permeable material in the form of polypropylene ropes placed in a cross-flow configuration within a flue gas stream. The cross-flow design has large surface area, which provides scrubbing action; therefore, it has the potential for removing multiple pollutants, including particulates, gases, vapors, and mists. In this new method, the ropes are kept wet by the liquid (water) introduced from the top of the cells running downward on the ropes by capillary action, making the permeable materials act as the ground electrode for capturing particles from the flue gas. Preliminary testing has shown an efficiency of well above 80% using two cells and three sets of discharge electrodes. Since the material of construction is primarily corrosion-resistant polymeric material, both weight and cost reductions are expected from this new design.Implications: The newly invented cross-flow WESP exhibit particulate collection efficiency of well above 80% when introduced in particulate-laden exhaust flow. This value was obtained using a two cells and three discharge electrodes configuration. The electric field strength has a substantial effect on the collection efficiency. Also, the pressure drop test results indicate that there is a potential to increase the collection area, which, in turn, will increase the collection efficiency further.",2016,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences

Contrary to expectations, no evidence has been found in the literature on the supposed positive regional innovation impact of FP participation. We assume in this article that the overall missing impact of EU FP participation on regional patenting masks an important spatial regime effect. Our results are supportive of this assumption. While FP research subsidies act as a substitute for funding from other sources in regions of old EU member states, innovation in lagging regions in Central and Eastern Europe tends to rely more on the external knowledge transferred via FP-funded research networks to compensate for their less developed local knowledge infrastructures. Our findings are important, as they suggest that, in combination with other policies, strengthening research excellence and international scientific networking in relatively lagging regions could be a viable option to increase regional innovativeness.",2017,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration; Urban Studies
Some Salient Aspects of Machine Learning Research: A Bibliometric Analysis,Machine Learning; Social Network Analysis; Bibliometrics; Co-word analysis; Intellectual Structure; ,"Machine learning has emerged as an important and distinct area of research closely related to and often overlaps with various domains within computer science, computational statistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science. One can observe connections with these fields at the cognitive level (in terms of theoretical framework), and on methodological levels (drawing from tools and techniques of these fields). The evolution of the field has taken a very directed and operational approach with basic tenet of machine learning being 'teaching computers how to learn from data to make decisions or predictions'. As we move into systems that increasingly need to exploit data, we find the research in this area getting more application oriented, expansive in scope with loci of research and innovation dispersed across academia, research institutions and industry. It is thus becoming a challenging as well as useful exercise to know the structure and dynamics of this field. The paper is centered on this issue; it tries to capture the intellectual structure of this field and research trends from quantitative and statistical analysis of research publications. Conceptual connections are constructed from linkages among keywords using tools and techniques of Social network Analysis. It also acts as a conceptual framework for the study. Some indications from patent statistics are also drawn to provide some insights of the technological trends.",2019,Information Science & Library Science

To study how supercoiling drives DNA biology, we developed and patented methods to make milligram quantities of tiny supercoiled circles of DNA called minicircles. We used a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach, including computational simulations (both atomistic and coarse-grained), biochemical experimentation, and biophysical methods to study these minicircles. By determining the three-dimensional conformations of individual supercoiled DNA minicircles, we revealed the structural diversity of supercoiled DNA and its highly dynamic nature. We uncovered profound structural changes, including sequence-specific base-flipping (where the DNA base flips out into the solvent), bending, and denaturing in negatively supercoiled minicircles. Counterintuitively, exposed DNA bases emerged in the positively supercoiled minicircles, which may result from inside-out DNA (Pauling-like, or P-DNA). These structural changes strongly influence how enzymes interact with or act on DNA. We hypothesized that, because of their small size and lack of bacterial sequences, these small supercoiled DNA circles may be efficient at delivering DNA into cells for gene therapy applications. Minivectors, as we named them for this application, have proven to have therapeutic potential. We discovered that minivectors efficiently transfect a wide range of cell types, including many clinically important cell lines that are refractory to transfection with conventional plasmid vectors. Minivectors can be aerosolized for delivery to lungs and transfect human cells in culture to express RNA or genes. Importantly, minivectors demonstrate no obvious vector-associated toxicity. Minivectors can be repeatedly delivered and are long-lasting without integrating into the genome. Requests from colleagues around the world for minicircle and minivector DNA revealed a demand for our invention. We successfully obtained start-up funding for Twister Biotech, Inc. to help fulfill this demand, providing DNA for those who needed it, with a long-term goal of developing human therapeutics. In summary, what started as a tool for studying DNA structure has taken us in new and unanticipated directions.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Methods: A survey was mailed in late 2013 to Florida providers who order HBOC testing. Descriptive statistics were conducted to characterize participants' responses. Results: Of 101 respondents, 66% indicated either no genetics education or education through a commercial laboratory. Although 79% of respondents were aware of the Supreme Court ruling resulting in the loss of Myriad Genetics' BRCA gene patent, only 19% had ordered testing from a different laboratory. With regard to pretest counseling, 78% of respondents indicated they usually discuss 11 of 14 nationally recommended elements for informed consent. Pretest discussion times varied from 3 to 120min, with approximately half spending <20min. Elements not routinely covered by >40% of respondents included (1) possibility of a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) and (2) issues related to life/disability insurance. With regard to genetic testing for HBOC, 88% would test an unaffected sister of a breast cancer patient identified with a BRCA VUS. Conclusions: Results highlight the need to identify whether variability in hereditary cancer service delivery impacts patient outcomes.

Additionally, it acts as a cell protector with unclear mechanism but may be implicated in combating against inflammation, fibrosis and cancers. FXR is thus accepted as a promising target particularly for the enterohepatic diseases, and numerous FXR modulators have been patented and developed. Areas covered: This review provides an update on the development of FXR modulators for enterohepatic diseases and offers an in-depth perspective on new strategies for the development of novel FXR modulators. Expert opinion: Despite the development of numerous FXR modulators, which culminated in the successful launch of obeticholic acid (OCA), it remains a matter of debate on how the function of FXR should be exploited for therapeutic purposes. The improvement for obesity achieved by either FXR agonists or antagonists is still in confusion. Whether the side effect of pruritus induced by OCA could be exempted for non-steroidal FXR agonists needs further validation. Apart from the development of conventional FXR ligands, emerging evidence support that restoration of FXR protein level may represent a new strategy in targeting FXR for enterohepatic and metabolic diseases.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
"Amgen Inc. v.

In this case, the sponsor (Amgen) alleges that the biosimilar applicant (Hospira) had failed to satisfy this obligation by refusing to fully disclose the specific composition of the cell-culture medium used in the manufacture'' of Hospira's biosimilar product. Amgen sought discovery on the composition of Hospira's cell-culture medium. Hospira refused Amgen's discovery requests, and the district court denied Amgen's motion to compel. On appeal, the Federal Circuit held that it lacks jurisdiction over the appeal under the collateral order doctrine, rejecting Amgen's argument that the lack of immediate appeal over the particular discovery order in this case will render it effectively unreviewable.'' The appellate court also denied Amgen's petition for a writ of mandamus, in part because the nature of the cell-culture medium used by Hospira is irrelevant to the question of infringement of the patents that have been asserted by Amgen, which relate to the biological product and methods of producing the biological product, rather than the specific cell-culture medium used during its manufacturing process.''",2017,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology
A hybrid conjugated method for assembly sequence generation and explode view generation,Automatic assembly; Assembly sequence planning; Assembly; Exploded view; Geometrical feasibility; Assembly sequence generation; Exploded view generation; Assembly automation; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; PARTS,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient hybrid method that can collectively address assembly sequence generation (ASG) and exploded view generation (EVG) problem effectively. ASG is an act of finding feasible collision free movement of components of a mechanical product in accordance with the assembly design. Although the execution of ASG is complex and time-consuming in calculation, it is highly essential for efficient manufacturing process. Because of numerous limitations of the ASG algorithms, a definite method is still unavailable in the computer-aided design (CAD) software, and therefore the explosion of the product is not found to be in accordance with any feasible disassembly sequence (disassembly sequence is reverse progression of assembly sequence). The existing EVG algorithms in the CAD software result in visualization of the entire constituent parts of the product over single screen without taking into consideration the feasible order of assembly operations; thus, it becomes necessary to formulate an algorithm which effectively solves ASG and EVG problem in conjugation. This requirement has also been documented as standard in the General Information Concerning Patents: 1.84 Standards for drawings in the United States Patent and Trademark office (2005) which states that the exploded view created for any product should show the relationship or order of assembly of various parts that are permissible. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, a unique ASG method has been proposed and is further extended for EVG. The ASG follows a deterministic approach to avoid redundant data collection and calculation. The proposed method is effectively applied on products which require such feasible paths of disassembly other than canonical directions. Findings The method is capable of organizing the assembly operations as linear or parallel progression of assembly such that the assembly task is completed in minimum number of stages. This result is further taken for EVG and is found to be proven effective. Originality/value Assembly sequence planning (ASP) is performed most of the times considering the geometric feasibility along canonical axes without considering parallel possibility of assembly operations. In this paper, the proposed method is robust to address this issue. Exploded view generation considering feasible ASP is also one of the novel approaches illustrated in this paper.",2019,Automation & Control Systems; Engineering

This study analyzes the collaborative innovation network from both intra- and inter-regional dimensions. We use the Chinese biomedical patent co-inventing data between entities to construct the intra- and inter-regional collaborative innovation networks, and examine how they generate the spillover effect by moderating the relationship between R&D input and output, as well as how they moderate the technology spillovers from overseas countries. The empirical study shows that collaborative innovation network generates a significant moderating effect on the relationship between R&D personnel and innovation output, while this effect is insignificant for R&D investment. In the intra-regional collaborative innovation network dimension, clustering coefficient and network density generate positive moderating effects by amplifying the positive relationship between R&D personnel and innovation output, network density also positively moderates the correlation between overseas technology spillover and innovation output; In the inter-regional dimension, only the clustering coefficient positively moderates the relationship between R&D personnel and innovation output.

Governments and universities are seeking to develop framework conditions that are conductive to spin-off creation. The most prevalent of such initiatives are legislative changes at national level and the establishment of technology transfer offices at university level. The effectiveness of such initiatives is debated, but empirical evidence is limited. In this paper, we analyze the full population of universities in Italy, Norway, and the UK; three countries adopting differing approaches to framework conditions, to test whether national- and university-level initiatives have an influence on the number of spin-offs created and the quality of these spin-offs. Building on institutional theory and using multilevel analysis, we find that changes in the institutional framework conditions at both national and university levels are conductive to the creation of more spin-offs, but that the increase in quantity is at the expense of the quality of these firms. Hence, the effect of such top-down changes in framework conditions on the economic impact from universities seems to be more symbolic than substantive.",2017,Business & Economics

Compounds 5a-r were found to selectively inhibit hCAII in the nanomolar range, while being less effective against the other hCA isoforms. As noted from the literature, sulfocoumarin (1,2-benzoxathiine 2,2-dioxide) acts as a prodrug inhibitor and is hydrolyzed by the esterase activity of hCA to form 2-hydroxyphenylvinylsulfonic acid, which thereafter binds to the enzyme in a manner similar to that of coumarins and sulfoxocoumarins. All these sulfocoumarins (compounds 7a-q) were found to be very weak or ineffective as inhibitors of the housekeeping off-target hCA isoforms I and II, and effectively inhibited the transmembrane tumor-associated isoforms IX and XII in the high nanomolar to micromolar ranges. Further structural modifications of these molecules could be useful for the development of effective hCA inhibitors used for the treatment of glaucoma, epilepsy, and cancer.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Three classes of ligands each bind to distinct sites on the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR84,; ACID; IDENTIFICATION; AGONIST; PHARMACOLOGY; ACTIVATION; POTENT; DISCOVERY; RESIDUES; MODEL,"Medium chain fatty acids can activate the pro-inflammatory receptor GPR84 but so also can molecules related to 3,3'-diindolylmethane. 3,3'-Diindolylmethane and decanoic acid acted as strong positive allosteric modulators of the function of each other and analysis showed the affinity of 3,3'-diindolylmethane to be at least 100 fold higher. Methyl decanoate was not an agonist at GPR84. This implies a key role in binding for the carboxylic acid of the fatty acid. Via homology modelling we predicted and confirmed an integral role of arginine(172), located in the 2nd extracellular loop, in the action of decanoic acid but not of 3,3'-diindolylmethane. Exemplars from a patented series of GPR84 antagonists were able to block agonist actions of both decanoic acid and 3,3'-diindolylmethane at GPR84. However, although a radiolabelled form of a related antagonist, [H-3]G9543, was able to bind with high affinity to GPR84, this was not competed for by increasing concentrations of either decanoic acid or 3,3'-diindolylmethane and was not affected adversely by mutation of arginine(172). These studies identify three separable ligand binding sites within GPR84 and suggest that if medium chain fatty acids are true endogenous regulators then co-binding with a positive allosteric modulator would greatly enhance their function in physiological settings.",2017,Science & Technology - Other Topics
Property as Institutions for Resources: Lessons from and for IP,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LIABILITY RULES; PATENT; COPYRIGHT; RIGHTS; LAW; PRIVATE; EVOLUTION; POLICY; GOVERNANCE,"The idea of property in land as the paradigm case of properly exercises despotic dominion over property thinking. From the perspective of evolving political economy, however, a land-centric model of property makes very little sense. Property institutions coordinate access to resources, and so it is reasonable to expect them to differ in ways that respond to the characteristics of those resources. The debate about whether intellectual properly (IF) is property is instructive. IF scholars have pursued the properly debate using a conceptual framework derived from common law real properly doctrines and organized around the practical and theoretical problems associated with properly rights in land, but the resources at the center of debates about the appropriate extent of IP-rightholder control could not be more different from land. Intellectual resources are routinely sliced and diced, aggregated and fractionated, used and reused, in ways that land is not and could not be. This might mean that IF is not properly, as some have argued, or it might mean that we have outgrown the monolithic, land-centric model that in the postindustrial era of wealth production, the cosmology of properly can no longer place terra firma at the center. This Article develops an account of properly as a set of resource-dependent legal institutions characterized by overlapping sets of family resemblances and then reconsiders the IF question. Properly in intellectual goods resembles properly in land in some respects, properly in natural resources in other respects, properly in corporations in others, and properly in intangible financial instruments in still others, but also systematically diverges from each of those other forms of properly. Legal institutions for IF must accommodate four important points of divergence: the different incentives of creators and intermediaries; the variety of ways in which intellectual goods are produced; the central importance of intermediation within IF ecologies; and the widespread use of licensing to delineate rights and obligations.",2015,Government & Law

The aim of this study was to provide long-term echocardiographic and clinical follow-up data on patients who had undergone percutaneous PFO closure with 2 different SOD. Methods: We selected 2 groups of patients treated with 2 different SOD: Group A: 52 patients with an Amplatzer (R) PFO Occluder and Group B: 49 patients with a Figulla Flex (R) device. All patients underwent follow-up Bubble Test Transthoracic Echocardiography (BTTE) and clinical examination. The results were compared with those recently reported in a group of patients with similar characteristics, but that had been treated conservatively, which acted as a control group. Results: The mean follow-up after PFO closure was 53 months. The Amplatzer (R) PFO Occluder and the Figulla Flex were used in 52 (51.5%) and 49 (48.5%) of patients, respectively. We found no significant difference in the rate of effective PFO closure between the devices: Amplatzer 91.4%, Figulla 93.9% (P = 0.71). One patient (1.0%) suffered a recurrent neurologic event. BTTE was positive (BTTE+) in 8 patients (8%), 5 with an Amplatzer, and 3 with a Figulla device (P = 0.516). Only 1 patient with BTTE+ had a recurrent TIA (12.5%). No significant relationship was found between device dimensions and BTTE+(P = 0.062). In the control group (163 patients), the recurrence of neurologic events was 9.2% (15 events), that was significantly higher in respect to the patients who had undergone percutaneous closure of the PFO. Conclusions: Percutaneous PFO closure was associated with a remarkably low risk of recurrent embolic neurological events, and no long-term device-related major complications. No statistically significant difference emerged between the 2 different SODs regarding BTTE positivity. Long-term follow-up showed that the recurrence of neurological events has been significantly higher in the group treated in a conservative way.",2016,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Non-Symmetric Gyroscope Skewed Pyramids,U.S. Patent 9567112 B1; control moment gyroscope; actuators; attitude control; guidance; navigation and control; spacecraft dynamics; skewed pyramid; CONTROL MOMENT GYROSCOPES; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; STEERING LAW,"The novel contribution in this manuscript is an expansion of the current state-of-the-art in the geometric installation of control moment gyroscopes beyond the benchmark symmetric skewed arrays and the four asymmetric arrays presented in recent literature. The benchmark pyramid symmetrically skewed at 54.73 degrees mandates significant attention to singularity avoidance, escape, and penetration, while the most recent four asymmetric arrays are strictly useful in instances where space is available to mount at least one gyro orthogonal to the others. Skewed arrays of gyros and the research-benchmark are introduced, followed by the present-day box-90 and roof configurations, where the roof configuration is the first prevalently used asymmetric geometry. Six other asymmetric options in the most recent literature are introduced, where four of the six options are obviously quite useful. From this inspiration, several dozen discrete options for asymmetric installations are critically evaluated using two figures of merit: maximum momentum (saturation) and maximum singularity-free momentum. Furthermore, continuous surface plots are presented to provide readers with countless (infinite) options for geometric installations. The manuscript firmly establishes many useful options for engineers who learn that the physical space on their spacecraft is insufficient to permit standard installations.",2019,Engineering
Challenging the Use of Special 301 against Measures Promoting Access to Medicines: Options Under the WTO Agreements,; ,"In April 2014, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) listed India on its Special 301 Priority Watch List, following India's refusal to grant a patent over the leukaemia drug Gleevec and its compulsory licensing of the cancer drug Nexavar. USTR also undertook an out-of-cycle review of India's intellectual property laws, to determine whether or not to upgrade India to the more serious Priority Foreign Country status, which would potentially trigger retaliation through withdrawal of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) benefits. In response, India threatened to take the USA to the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Dispute Settlement Body over Special 301. This article examines whether such a challenge to Special 301 in the WTO would succeed, both in the India context and more generally. It takes three lines of inquiry. The first is whether or not the Special 301 procedure violates the procedural obligations under Article 23 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). The second is whether or not any related withdrawal of GSP benefits would be in line with the Enabling Clause. Finally, the article examines whether there are substantive limitations on intellectual property protections under TRIPS which could be used to challenge the validity of Special 301. It concludes that some, but not all, aspects of Special 301 may be inconsistent with WTO obligations.",2016,Government & Law

The issue has been extensively studied in general, but there is no previous research on the effects that an international strengthening of legal protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) due to the Uruguay Round Agreement and the Annex on Trade-Related aspects of the IPR (TRIPs, for short), underwritten in 1994, may have had on worldwide emissions, as a result of the discovery of new or more efficient air pollution abatement technologies. Different econometric models are used to give a quantitative measure of the TRIPs agreement to reduce air pollution. In particular, the impact of the TRIPs is addressed using a dummy variable and the index of Ginarte and Park (Ginarte, Park 1997) that is one of the more commonly used indicators of TRIPs enforcement employed in economic literature. The findings of this research partially support the idea that the strengthening of a uniform minimum standard protection level of IPR, among the member countries of the World Trade Organization, may help to reduce air pollution emissions.",2017,Business & Economics
"Examining plant variety protection in Nigeria: Realities, obligations and prospects",access and benefit sharing; farmers' rights; Nigeria; plant breeder's rights; plant variety protection; TRIPS; FARMERS RIGHTS; COMMUNITY; LEGAL,"Nigeria does not currently have a plant variety protection system. Three key reasons why Nigerian law and policy makers should pay attention to plant variety protection are the country's evolving agricultural sector, susceptibility to external pressures and pending international obligations. From 2010, successive Nigerian governments have promoted private sector investments in agriculture, contributing to the increase in the number of agribusinesses in the country. Agribusinesses tend to lobby for the introduction or reform of national plant variety protection systems to suit their business interests. Furthermore, as a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Nigeria has a pending obligation under Article 27.3(b) of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to protect plant varieties through a patent system, a sui generis system, or a combination of systems. This article argues that Nigeria should proactively introduce a plant variety protection system designed to suit its socio-economic realities before it is pressured to adopt an unsuitable system. In assessing the options under TRIPS vis-a-vis the small-scale centered agricultural sector in Nigeria, the article finds that the best-suited option for the country is a sui generis system which protects the interests of both small-scale farmers and agribusinesses.",2019,Government & Law

The first generation analyzes the origins of new intellectual property rules, in particular the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and the significance of TRIPS to developing countries. The second generation examines national-level experiences, as countries adjust their laws and practices to conform to TRIPS. Based on the insights provided by the articles in the special issue, we contribute to the second generation by considering a pair of overarching sets of issues. First, we highlight the domestic political challenges that affect how countries go about implementing their new obligations under TRIPS. We argue that alliances and coalitions are necessary to underpin the use of policy instruments designed to conform to TRIPS while taking into account local conditions and needs, and we present insights that allow us to understand why alliances and coalitions are difficult to construct and sustain in this area. Second, we explain why policies that many countries adopt in response to TRIPS often do not generate their desired or intended outcomes. In the last section of the introduction, we review the articles that appear in this special issue.",2015,Development Studies; International Relations; Government & Law
Technology transitions within telecommunications networks: Lessons from US vs. Canadian policy experimentation under federalism,Broadband; Common carrier; Deregulation; Federalism; Internet protocol; Monopoly; Path dependence; Policy experimentation; Public relations; Public utility; EVOLUTION,"This article examines why recent telecommunications policy outcomes are diverging between the U.S. and Canada, notwithstanding the similarities in their common law and statutory law histories. The consequences of this divergence are profound. As technology transitions within the public switched telecommunications network proceed, the U.S. imposes fewer obligations on broadband and Internet service providers and provides a much-diminished level of consumer protection relative to that in Canada. The role of differing administrative procedures and policymaking forums is an important factor contributing to recent policy divergence. Historical analysis also reveals the importance of the role of path dependence from some early differences in U.S. and Canadian policy choices made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These differences in early policy choices emerged from (1) differences in federalism structures between the U.S. and Canada; (2) negation of Bell patents in Canada that triggered an earlier era of telephony competition as well as both federal and provincial policy experimentation; and (3) AT&T's unique public relations campaign of regulated monopoly developed in the U.S. in response to this earlier policy experimentation in Canada. AT&T's public relations campaign has induced a false memory in the U.S. - not found in Canada - as to the origins of regulated monopoly for telephony. This false memory has contributed to the efficacy of telecommunications carriers' false monopoly theory argument - that their historical duties have been based on the existence of monopoly, and thus are not applicable in a competitive environment - which has and continues to distort telecommunications policy development in the U.S. including the network neutrality debate. Yet, telecommunications carriers' dual status as common carriers and public utilities under the common law has created confusion in both the U.S. and Canada. This confusion has created a tendency to misattribute the duty to serve to the existence of monopoly, providing a different although still historically flawed basis for asserting a monopoly theory argument for the purpose of eliminating regulation. This confusion, however is more easily corrected in Canada where there was no comparable public relations campaign of regulated monopoly for proponents of deregulation to leverage. The resonance of early policy differences between the U.S. and Canada illustrates the complexity of pursuing telecommunications policy debates within multi-jurisdictional legal frameworks a challenge that the European Union currently faces in developing a Telecommunications Single Market.

The complex reactivity of β-diketiminato magnesium(I) dimers towards pinacolborane: implications for catalysis,; REAGENTS; ACTIVATION; ADDUCT; EARTHS; BOND,"Reactions between the borane, HBpin (pin = pinacolato), and three magnesium(i) dimers, [{((Ar)Nacnac)Mg-}(2)] ((Ar)Nacnac = [(ArNCMe)(2)CH](-); Ar = xylyl (Xyl), mesityl (Mes) or 2,6-diethylphenyl (Dep)), have been carried out in 2:1, 5:1 and 20:1 ratios. In all cases, NMR spectroscopic studies have revealed complex mixtures of many known and novel products from these reactions. From extracts of the crude reaction mixtures, low yields of ten compounds, representing six different types of complexes between -diketiminato magnesium fragments and boron containing ligands, have been isolated and crystallographically characterised. These include unprecedented examples of compounds in which the -carbon of the -diketiminate ligand has been activated by boron hydride fragments. In addition, boryloxide (OBpin), borate ([B(pin)(2)](-) or [(pin)BH2](-)), B-O bond ruptured [pinBH(2)](-), a diborane(5) dianion, or BH3 have been shown to be incorporated into the isolated complexes. The complexity of the products of the reported reactions are discussed in light of recently published patents and papers which report that magnesium(i) dimers act as efficient catalysts, or as pre-catalysts to well defined catalysts, for the hydroboration of a variety of unsaturated substrates by HBpin. Our results strongly suggest that magnesium(i) dimers are not catalysts in these reactions, and that there are many more potential (pre-)catalysts that are generated in these reactions, than have previously been reported.",2019,Chemistry

Even in the former case, treatment frequently yields recalcitrant tumors and women succumb to disease. Here we examine the impact of nelfinavir, an off-patent viral protease inhibitor, which has shown promise as an antineoplastic agent. Methods: We evaluated the morphological and proliferative effects of the autophagy-stressing drug nelfinavir in normal and cisplatin-resistant cervical cancer cells. Immunofluorescent validation of autophagy markers was performed and the impact of nelfinavir in an in vivo model of tumor growth was determined. Results: Nelfinavir exhibits cytotoxicity against both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ME-180 human cervical cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence showed an expression of the autophagy marker LC3-II in response to nelfinavir treatment. Conclusion: Nelfinavir, now available as an inexpensive generic orally dosed agent (Nelvir), is cytotoxic against cervical cancer cells. It acts by burdening the autophagy pathway to impair tumor cell survival and a modest induction of apoptosis. While further studies are needed to elucidate the optimal method of application of nelfinavir, it may represent an appealing global option for the treatment of cervical cancer.",2016,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Under the influence of interferon( IFN)gamma, the IFN gamma-inducible chemokines are secreted by lymphocytes, and by target cells (fibroblasts, epithelial cells, etc). In target tissues, Th1 lymphocytes are recruited; hence IFN. is enhanced, which stimulates IFN gamma-inducible chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) secretion reiterating the autoimmune process. Many studies have evaluated if blockade of CXCR3 or its chemokines have therapeutic significance in autoimmune diseases (for example in thyroid autoimmune disorders, etc). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma or -alpha agonists show a strong inhibitory effect on the expression and production of CXCR3 chemokines in vitro, in various kinds of cells, such as denditric cells, monocytes, macrophages, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, intestinal cells, thyrocytes, fibroblasts, preadipocytes and mesangial cells, and in vivo in animal models. Further studies are ongoing to explore the use of new molecules that act as antagonists of CXCR3, or block CXCL10, in autoimmune disorders, and many interesting patents have been recently applied. Phase II studies have assessed the efficacy and safety of fully human, monoclonal antibodies to CXCL10, for the treatment of autoimmune disorders (for example rheumatoid arthritis, or ulcerative colitis).",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

However, the success of these policies depends on the appeal of creating a USO for academics. The aim of this research was to examine the relative importance of certain factors that may boost academic entrepreneurship and, therefore, to guide public policies. To do this, a qualitative study was carried out among 42 researchers from Spanish universities and research centres to understand their motivations for creating a USO. A quantitative study was then carried out, based on Conjoint Analysis and with a sample of 1726 academics, to identify the relative importance of six conditions that influence their predisposition to become entrepreneurs. This technique is seldom used in the field of entrepreneurship and, to the best of our knowledge, has never been used before to analyse academic entrepreneurship. The results of the study show that personal economic benefit is clearly the factor that heightens the intention to create a USO the most. Research benefit, CV benefit, support programmes, teaching reduction and personal cost are of lesser importance. The study also concludes that there are few differences according to the academic's profile.",2018,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

This area of pathologies offers an excellent potential for the development of innovative solutions such as nanoformulations; this review aims to describe the main categories of nanostructured drug delivery platforms that have been developed in order to achieve a more effective, low toxic treatment in autoimmune pathologies. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed original studies focusing on nanoformulations suitable for use against autoimmune disorders. Each study was evaluated by at least two reviewers who applied inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to establish the quality of the research reported in the selected papers. The systematic screening of the literature also identified the most recent patents issued in the field of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases which were included in the current paper. Results: One hundred ninety-seven bibliographic titles were included in the review of which fifty-three recently published patents. Twenty-one papers were selected to define the interaction between nanoformulations and the immune system triggering either immunosuppression or immunostimulation. Thirty-seven papers outlined the characteristics of liposomal formulations that have been reported as treatment for several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis. Twentythree articles provided data on the main lipid nanoparticles of the first and second generation which may include physiological lipids with low cytotoxicity. Gold nanoparticles were described by thirteen papers which highlighted the advantages of the new hybrid organic-inorganic nanoparticles vs. the classical ionic gold compounds. Polymeric nanoformulations were the subject of fifty-nine papers that described their preparation as well as various advantages in the treatment of inflammatory disorders; dendrimers and polymeric micelles were included in the study. Thirty-three studies were selected to outline the benefits provided by the use of cyclodextrins as carriers for active drugs. The review also identified the possibility of producing combined nanoformulations (e.g. polymer/cyclodextrin, liposome/polymer) thus achieving superior therapeutic results. Conclusion: Nanoformulations offer multiple advantages over the classical pharmaceutical formulations, the main ones being the precise targeted therapy with small doses of active drugs, longer circulating time in the bloodstream, and high loading capacity for diagnostic and therapeutic molecules; moreover, the nanoparticles may be functionalized in order to act as nanotheranostics within the larger frame of personalized medicine.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics
Using Value-Agnostic Incentives to Promote Pharmaceutical Innovation,; BAYH-DOLE ACT; DRUG DISCOVERY; UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; ACCOUNTABILITY; EXCLUSIVITY; PRICES; COST; INDUSTRY; BIOTECH,"Who lives, who dies, and who decides? For more than one hundred years, innovative pharmaceuticals have cured disease, prolonged life, and reduced human suffering. However, the social welfare benefits associated with pharmaceuticals come at increasingly steep costs. Millions of Americans are unable to afford lifesaving medications, leading to calls for reform at all levels of government-including proposals for nationalized drug companies, value-based pricing, and compulsory licensing of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Although some of these proposals might be socially beneficial, this Note argues that they are doomed to short-term political failure in the United States. By directing outrage primarily at the business decisions of innovative, for-profit companies with legal monopolies over pharmaceuticals, legal scholars and policy analysts advocating for increased government intervention overlook difficult policy considerations likely to stymie novel innovation and commercialization efforts directed by politically accountable actors. For example: In a resource-strapped world, which diseases should limited research and development funds be directed toward? Should the most effective drugs be pursued, regardless of cost and delays? And given high failure rates for pharmaceuticals reaching even Phase III clinical trials, how many experimental drugs should be investigated for a specific disease? Relying on the private sector for pharmaceutical innovation allows government officials to sidestep these politically toxic questions-the drug-development equivalent of death panels, a political term describing purported health care rationing administered by bureaucrats. To clarify the tradeoffs policymakers face in formulating innovation incentives, this Note provides a conceptual framework for understanding pharmaceutical innovation, describes the U.S. government's current approach to incentivizing drug development, and explains why recent proposals for government intervention in drug development markets are too politically fraught to gain the broad legislative support necessary to increase access to medicines in practice. Instead, this Note proposes value-agnostic programs, which indirectly influence innovation while leaving original disease- and drug-level value judgments in private hands, as a more realistic path for pharmaceutical reform. This Note suggests, as one example of this framework, a patent buyout system that enables the U.S. government to nudge pricing while substantially maintaining current innovation incentives. Specifically, before selling or exclusively licensing an approved drug or drug candidate, recipients of certain federal drug discovery subsidies would first be required to auction off related patents, with the U.S. government maintaining the right to purchase or license at the second-highest bid price.",2019,Government & Law

Moreover, it is a tool for female self-protection against HIV, making it highly relevant to sub-Saharan regions, where women have the highest infection burden. To date, Truvada is the only medication for PrEP. However, the cost of Truvada limits its uptake in resource-constrained countries. Similarly, several currently investigated, patent-protected compounds may be unaffordable in these regions. We set out to explore the potential of the patent-expired antiviral efavirenz (ERV) as a cost-efficient PrEP alternative. A population pharmacokinetic model utilizing data from the ENCORE1 study was developed. The model was refined for metabolic autoinduction. We then explored EFV cellular uptake mechanisms, finding that it is largely determined by plasma protein binding. Next, we predicted the prophylactic efficacy of various EFV dosing schemes after exposure to HIV using a stochastic simulation framework. We predicted that plasma concentrations of 11, 36, 1287 and 1486ng/mL prevent 90% sexual transmissions with wild type and Y181C, K103N and G190S mutants, respectively. Trough concentrations achieved after 600 mg once daily dosing (median: 2017 ng/mL, 95% CI:445-9830) and after reduced dose (400 mg) efavirenz (median: 1349ng/mL, 95% CI: 297-6553) provided complete protection against wild-type virus and the Y181C mutant, and median trough concentrations provided about 90% protection against the K103N and G190S mutants. As reduced dose ER/ has a lower toxicity profile, we predicted the reduction in HIV infection when 400 mg EFV-PrEP was poorly adhered to, when it was taken on demand and as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Once daily EFV-PrEP provided 99% protection against wild-type virus, if >= 50% of doses were taken. PrEP on demand provided complete protection against wild-type virus and prevented >= 81% infections in the mutants. PEP could prevent >98% infection with susceptible virus when initiated within 24 h after virus exposure and continued for at least 9 days. We predict that 400 mg oral ER/ may provide superior protection against wild-type HIV. However, further studies are warranted to evaluate ER/ as a cost-efficient alternative to Truvada. Predicted prophylactic concentrations may guide release kinetics of ER/ long-acting formulations for clinical trial design.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
LOSS CAUSATION ON TRIAL IN RULE 10B-5 LITIGATION A DECADE AFTER DURA,; FINANCE THEORY; FRAUD,"In the decade since the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, outlining the pleading standard for loss causation in securities fraud class actions, only seven such cases have been tried to verdict. Thus, while the case law addressing the loss causation requirement at the pleading stage abounds, there is a paucity of decisions that address the burden of proof at the trial stage. This Article explores the small constellation of post-trial decisions that set forth the basic contours of establishing loss causation and damages at trial. We examine the courts' treatment of some of the more prominent loss causation theories litigated through trial and appeal since Dura's issuance. First, we trace the price maintenance theory, premised on the idea that a material misrepresentation can artificially inflate a security's price by propping up, or maintaining, the existing stock price without increasing it, and look at how the theory was litigated in three Rule 10b-5 trials. Next, we survey how courts have wrestled with the question of what constitutes a corrective disclosure for purposes of proving loss causation at trial. Finally, we examine the leakage theory which posits that often times the details and consequences of a fraud do not come to light all at once but rather trickle out over time, and that damages can derive from stock price declines other than strictly those associated with patent corrective disclosures.",2017,Government & Law
Textual migration in Ebenezer Obey's juju music,juju; oriki; myth; improvisation; oral chanter; ,"This study examines textual migration as one of the principal sources of Ebenezer Obey's juju music in the framework of free borrowing that characterised the oral composition and performances of Yoruba traditional chanters. In indigenous Yoruba societies, in which there was no patent law governing artistic productions, free borrowing allowed chanters to pick song items from different sources within the context of performance to deck up composition. Obey has expertly made use of this artistic graft herein referred to as textual migration. The study has identified three major sources of textual migration deployed by Ebenezer Obey. The first is from Yoruba oral genres such as oriki (praise poetry), incantatory poetry, festival songs, itan (story) and myths. The second is from Christian oral genres and heritage such as hymnal composition and Christian sermons or evangelical discourses. Obey's third textual migration derives from Yoruba folk music and older forms of popular music in Yoruba and other parts of the world. Intertextuality and the concept of polyvocality would be used to analyse Obey's song-poetry. Intertextuality studies interactions between and among texts with a view to establishing the modality of relationship between such texts. Polyvocality is a conceptual notion that posits that individual speakers' utterances are overpopulated and are largely drawn from various sources that individual speakers might not consciously notice. These theories are therefore appropriate analytical tools to study the artistic graft that operates in Obey's music.",2018,Area Studies

It is well documented that Brazil and Thailand have notably attempted CL. A realist review was undertaken to understand the identical social interventions in comparative settings, and to draw practical implications for attempting CL relevant for middle-income countries in the era of high-cost medicines. CL is not only a politically well-devised measure to achieve universal health coverage, but also a tentative commitment, which is determined both at the country level and at the global level. At the country level, political will, with catalytic roles of civil activism, is important in order to guarantee the right to health. Through this will, the governments can achieve universal health coverage. In addition, electoral systems, political leaders, and a constitution are necessary to attempt CL. In addition, CL should operate along with other policy instruments, including a comprehensive essential medicines list, CL-friendly phrasing in patent law, and a competent pharmaceutical industry. At the global level, the balance of power between the WTO regime and the global justice movement is critical. This provides global-level context that can either encourage or prevent CL.",2019,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
The Language of Constitutionalism and the Royal Prerogative in the English Parliament of 1593: James Morice's Speech on the Ex Officio Proceedings and his Constitutional Thought,absolute monarchy; court of high commission; ex officio oath; monopolies; royal prerogative; 16th-century constitutionalism; ,"In the parliamentary speech on the ex officio proceedings delivered in 1593 by James Morice, a prominent Elizabethan common lawyer, there appeared an original interpretation of the relationship between the royal prerogative and the law. Morice's speech, aimed at declaring illegal the ex officio oath, resulted from the strengthening of the authority of the monarchy and state in the late 16th century, a distinctive feature of the last decade of Elizabeth I's reign. The oath was imposed in particular by the court of high commission for causes ecclesiastical, whose judges received their powers from the crown by means of letters patent. In order to achieve his objective, Morice introduced two bills in the attempt to curb the abuses of the ecclesiastical judges through legislation, one of the ordinary prerogatives. In parliament, he deployed powerful legal and political arguments to move the queen to protect and guarantee the subjects' rights by virtue of the royal prerogative. The exercise of the prerogative in the last decade of the Elizabethan reign is a key to understanding the transformation in governmentality that caused Morice's parliamentary action, which anticipates the strategies later enacted by common lawyers - most notably Edward Coke - in reaction to the expanding authority of the English state and monarchy.",2018,History

NICE guidelines are explicit that a competent woman's informed request for MRCS (elective caesarean in the absence of any clinical indications) should be respected. However, in reality pregnant women are routinely denied MRCS. In this paper I consider whether there is sufficient justification for restricting MRCS. The physical and emotive significance of childbirth as an event in a woman's life cannot be understated. It is, therefore, concerning that women are having their wishes ignored, and we must ascertain whether the denial of agency is justifiable. To answer this question I first demonstrate that access to MRCS is a lottery in the UK. Second, I argue that there is nothing unique about pregnancy that displaces the ethical norm of respecting patents' sufficiently autonomous choices. Thus, the starting presumption is that all informed choices regarding MRCS should be respected. To ascertain whether any restriction of MRCS is justifiable the burden of proof must be placed on those who argue that MRCS is ethically impermissible. I argue that the most common justifications in the literature against MRCS are insufficient to displace the presumption in favour of autonomous choice in childbirth. I conclude that MRCS should be available to pregnant women, and we must strive to reduce the lottery in access to choice.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Biomedical Social Sciences

We focus on transfer of frontier technology in China's newly designated strategic emerging industries (SEIs). Drawing on a survey of foreign firms, extensive interviews with foreign firms, and case studies of Chinese firms, we identify three categories of FTT policies in SEIs: lose the market, no choice, and violate the law policies. Our thematic analysis finds that FTT policies likely exert the most leverage over (i.e., force) frontier technology transfer when accompanied by seven conditions: (1) strong state support for industrial growth, (2) oligopoly competition, (3) other policies closely complementing FTT policies, (4) high technological uncertainty, (5) policy mode of operation offering basic appropriability and tailored to industrial structure, (6) reform avoidance by the state, and (7) stringent policy compliance mechanisms. We develop a Strategy & Risk Matrix to forecast the overall leverage of individual FTT policies. We conclude that Chinese FTT policies may enable domestic acquisition of frontier foreign technology if all seven conditions determining policy leverage are fully exploited by the state. However, if this is not the case, the policies have weaker leverage and may even discourage technology transfer.",2018,Business & Economics; Public Administration
CREATING AROUND COPYRIGHT,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NORMS; FAIR-USE; INNOVATION; PATENT; CONSTRAINTS; ECONOMICS; WORK; IMAGINATION; INCENTIVES; STATEMENTS,"It is generally understood that the copyright system constrains downstream creators by limiting their ability to use protected works in follow-on expression. Those who view the promotion of creativity as copyright's mission usually consider this constraint to be a necessary evil at best and an unnecessary one at worst. This conventional wisdom rests on the seemingly intuitive premise that more creative choice will deliver more creativity. Yet that premise is belied by both the history of the arts and contemporary psychological research on the creative process. In fact, creativity flourishes best not under complete freedom, but rather under a moderate amount of restriction. Drawing from work in cognitive psychology, management studies, and art history; this Article argues that contemporary copyright discourse has overlooked constraint's generative upside. The Article unpacks the concept of constraint into seven characteristics: source, target, scope, clarity, timing, severity, and polarity. These characteristics function as levers that determine a given constraint's generative potential. Variation in that potential provides an underappreciated theoretical justification for areas in which copyright law is restrictive, such as the exclusive derivative work right, as well as areas where it is permissive, such as the independent creation and fair use defenses. The Article reveals that the incentives versus access debate that has long dominated copyright theory has misunderstood the relationship between creativity and constraint.

Innovation Policy Pluralism,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; BAYH-DOLE; PUBLIC RESEARCH; MARKET POWER; INCENTIVES; PATENTS; PRIZES; RULES; INSTRUMENTS; COMPETITION,"When lawyers and scholars speak of intellectual property, they are generally referring to a combination of two distinct elements: an innovation incentive that promises a market-based reward to producers of knowledge goods, and an allocation mechanism that makes access to knowledge goods conditional upon payment of a proprietary price. Distinguishing these two elements clarifies ongoing debates about intellectual property and opens up new possibilities for innovation policy. Once intellectual property is disaggregated into its core components, each element can be combined synergistically with non-IP innovation incentives such as prizes, tax preferences, and direct spending on grants and government research, or with non-IP allocation mechanisms that promote broader access to knowledge goods. In this Article, we build a novel conceptual framework for analyzing combinations of IP and non-IP policy mechanisms and present a new vocabulary to characterize those combinations. Matching involves the pairing of an IP incentive with a non-IP allocation mechanism-or, vice versa, the pairing of a non-IP incentive with IP as an allocation strategy. Mixing entails the use of IP and non-IP tools on the same side of the incentive/allocation divide: i.e., the use of both IP and non-IP innovation incentives, or of IP and non-IP allocation mechanisms. Layering refers to the use of different policies at different jurisdictional levels, such as using non-IP innovation incentives and allocation mechanisms at the domestic level within an international legal system oriented around IP. After setting forth this framework, we identify reasons why different combinations of IP and non-IP tools may be optimal in specific circumstances. Our project is not merely theoretical: we argue that pluralism - the combination of IP and non-IP policies-provides a more descriptively accurate account of the innovation policy landscape than those that dominate the existing literature. Governments routinely, though often unwittingly, incorporate strategies of matching, mixing, and layering into their innovation policies. Even in the pharmaceutical industry-a sector sometimes described as the poster child for the pure IP patent system-the United States and other countries rely on complex combinations of IP and non-IP elements at the domestic level, all layered within an international IP system that apportions the costs of knowledge production across countries. Dissecting and reassembling the elements of this knowledge-production system reveals a richer menu of possibilities for IP reform, with potential applications to property law more broadly.",2019,Government & Law
Impact of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde-derived aroylhydrazones on the copper-catalyzed oxidation of the M112A PrP103-112 mutant fragment,Aroylhydrazones; Human prion protein; Copper(II); Methionine oxidation; Oxidative stress; PRION PROTEIN; METHIONINE OXIDATION; METAL-IONS; BINDING; IRON; COORDINATION; PARKINSONS; ALZHEIMERS; COMPLEXES; HYDRAZONE,"Misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) is known for its role in fatal neurodegenerative conditions, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. PrP fragments and their mutants represent important tools in the investigation of the neurotoxic mechanisms and in the evaluation of new compounds that can interfere with the processes involved in neuronal death. Metal-catalyzed oxidation of PrP has been implicated as a trigger for the conformational changes in protein structure, which, in turn, lead to misfolding. Targeting redox-active biometals copper and iron is relevant in the context of protection against the oxidation of biomolecules and the generation of oxidative stress, observed in several conditions and considered an event that might promote sporadic prion diseases as well as other neurodegenerative disorders. In this context, ortho-pyridine aroylhydrazones are of interest, as they can act as moderate tridentate ligands towards divalent metal ions such as copper(II). In the present work, we explore the potentiality of this chemical class as peptide protecting agents against the deleterious metal-catalyzed oxidation in the M112A mutant fragment of human PrP, which mimics relevant structural features that may play an important role in the neurotoxicity observed in prion pathologies. The compounds inhere studied, especially HPCFur, showed an improved stability in aqueous solution compared to our patented lead hydrazone INHHQ, displaying a very interesting protective effect toward the oxidation of methionine and histidine, processes that are related to both physiological and pathological aging.",2019,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry
FROM EDITORS TO ALGORITHMS A values-based approach to understanding story selection in the Facebook news feed,algorithmic curation; algorithms; content analysis; critical algorithm studies; Facebook; material culture analysis; news information; news values; MEDIA; COVERAGE; POWER; BIAS,"Facebook's News Feed is an emerging, influential force in our personal information flows, especially where news information is concerned. However, as the News Feed's story selection mechanism starts to supplant traditional editorial story selection, we have no window into its story curation process that is parallel to our extensive knowledge of the news values that drive traditional editorial curation. The sensitive, trade-secret nature of the News Feed and its constant updates and modifications make a traditional, computer science-based examination of this algorithmic giant difficult, if not impossible. This study takes an alternative approach, using a content analysis of Facebook's own patents, press releases, and Securities and Exchange Commission filings to identify a core set of algorithmic values that drive story selection on the Facebook News Feed. Informed by the principles of material culture analysis, it ranks these values to create a window into Facebook's curation process, and compares and contrasts Facebook's story selection values with traditional news values, examining the possible consequences of one set of values supplanting the other. The study finds a set of nine News Feed values that drive story selection: friend relationships, explicitly expressed user interests, prior user engagement, implicitly expressed user preferences, post age, platform priorities, page relationships, negatively expressed preferences, and content quality. It also finds evidence that friend relationships act as an overall influence on all other story selection values.",2017,Communication
Real Time Eye Blink Extraction Circuit Design from EEG Signal for ALS Patients,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Eye blinks; Brain-computer interface (BCI); Brain waves; COMMUNICATION; ARTIFACT; REMOVAL; QUALITY; SYSTEM,"The paper explores the detail design of electroencephalogram (EEG) based eye blink circuit module for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients using the Multisim Circuit design software. The EEG gives information about physiological function. It is the recording of electrical activity of the brain waves. The brain wave signal is a random, frequency domain and non-stationary signal. It is not easy to get the information from EEG signals in the time domain. Some biological artifacts (Eye blink artifacts, EMG artifacts and ECG) and technical artifacts (amplitude artifact, noise present in the power source artifact etc.) are the some artifacts in EEG signals. Eye blinks is considered as one of the important artifact for feature extraction of EEG signal. Hence, Eye blinks act as control or input signal in this paper. The goal of this paper is tracking an eye blink of a person from EEG signal sequences and extracts only intentionally eye blinks. In this work the patient EEG data is acquired, amplified and filtered. The filtered data is compared with the reference voltage level of the eye blink signal. In this way the eye blinks are extracted from ALS patient EEG data. Thus, The EEG based eye blink extraction circuit for ALS patient has been successfully designed and simulated on Multisim circuit design software. The future goal is to establish a communication channel for the patents suffering from motor disabilities using this biological artifact.",2018,Engineering
Biosimilar uptake by British local formularies: a cross sectional study,Biosimilars; Biological medicines; Great Britain; Local formularies; THINK,"Background Biological medicines are starting to lose their patent protection, so similar, inexact copies (biosimilars) are being developed and licensed. The high acquisition costs of biologics for healthcare providers could be reduced by switching to biosimilars, thus alleviating budgetary pressures and increasing patient access. Therefore, the acceptance of biosimilars by prescribers in Great Britain (GB; England, Scotland, Wales) needs to be described and understood. Objective To determine uptake of the first wave of biosimilars (somatropin, epoetin, filgrastim) by local formularies (lists of preferred medicines for prescribing in local healthcare settings). Settings This study targeted local formularies in GB. Method In November 2014, local formularies (medicines formularies of Acute Trusts and Health Boards in GB) were screened for their approach to listing of biologics and their biosimilars as well as recommendations on usage of these pharmaceuticals. Main Outcomes Measures Listing frequencies of biosimilars. Results One hundred and forty-six British local formularies were screened. Amongst the 80% of formularies in which brand names were specified, biosimilar filgrastim was the most frequently listed when compared to the other targeted biosimilars. Biosimilars were listed in preference to reference biologic medicine in 49% of local formularies for filgrastim, 11% for somatropin and in only 6% for epoetin. Conclusion Although the market for biosimilars can act in parallel to the generic market, their uptake measured using local British formularies was less than what is expected given that the British market for medicines has a strong focus on generics. Finally, geographical variability within GB requires further investigation.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Often taking the US Bayh-Dole-Act as a model, many European states have recently implemented changes in how inventions at academic institutions are to be handled to optimize their societal impact. We analyze how these changes have been taken up-and made sense of-in regions with different pre-existing infrastructures, practices and semantics of invention management. For doing so, we build on a comparative analysis of continuities and changes in infrastructures, practices and semantics of invention management in North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW, a former Western state) and Saxony (a former GDR state) to reflect on how academic institutions have been handling inventions along transforming socio-political contexts. Building on document analysis and qualitative interviews with research managers, we discuss ongoing differences in practices of invention management and the semantic framing of the societal value of inventions in NRW and Saxony, and discuss how this can be understood before the background of their ideological, political and economic separation until reunification in 1990. Joining the conceptual perspectives of path dependencies and sociotechnical imaginaries, we argue that two critical incidents in the history of these states (the reunification in 1990 and a legal change in 2002) allowed for wide-ranging institutional alignments, but also allowed path dependencies in practices and semantics of invention management to prevail.",2018,Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics
"Internal migration, regional labor markets and the role of agglomeration economies",; INCREASING RETURNS; GROWTH; MODELS; INNOVATION; DIVERSITY; GEOGRAPHY,"We analyze the determinants and regional implications of internal migration flows across Danish municipalities in 2006-2012. Besides assessing the role of labor market and housing market factors in driving a region's net migration rate, we particularly focus on agglomeration factors identified by new migration theories related to regional growth models and the new economic geography. The work contributes to the field in the following way: we extend the scarce literature on the different channels through which agglomeration economies act as an attractor for mobile labor. Moreover, we account for the role of space-time dynamic adjustment processes and simultaneity among migration and labor market variables and finally test for heterogeneity in the migration response to regional labor market disparities among low- and high-skilled migrants. Our results support the view that agglomeration economies are indeed key drivers of internal migration flows in Denmark. That is, while we obtain mixed evidence with regard to the role of traditional labor and housing market variables, most of the included proxies for agglomeration economies such as the region's population density, patent intensity, endowment with human capital as well as the region's employment share of knowledge-intensive services are positively correlated with the region's net in-migration rate. Regarding the regional implications of internal migration flows, the results hint at a process of cumulative causation for the time period of analysis running from agglomeration economies to the inflow of mobile labor and subsequent regional income development.",2015,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration
Global Access to Maize Germplasm Provided by the US National Plant Germplasm System and by US Plant Breeders,; GENETIC-RESOURCES; DENT CORN; GREEN-REVOLUTION; DIVERSITY; IMPROVEMENT; PROTECTION; INBREDS,"Access to high-yielding germplasm increases agricultural productivity. Plant Variety Protection (PVP) is the most globally used form of Intellectual Property Protection. Commercially available varieties protected solely by PVP can be accessed for further breeding within the country or region of protection. Unlike the practice in most other countries, the USDA has a policy of providing parental inbred lines of hybrids into the public domain following expiration of their protection by PVP. Parental lines and varieties protected by utility patents are also available in the public domain following expiration of protection. These distributions represent fresh opportunities for researchers, hybrid seed producers and plant breeders, nationally and internationally. As a contribution to the continuing debate over ownership and access to plant germplasm we report distributions of maize (Zea mays L.) by the US National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS). During 1988-2015 the NPGS distributed 251,926 packets to 7,582 requestors, fulfilling 10,432 orders. Distributions were primarily to US entities (87%), with 32,520 (13%) to a total of 79 foreign countries. Of the total NPGS maize distributions reported here, 45,968 (18%) were expired or off-PVP germplasm. We hope that access provided to this germplasm will act as a reminder that the primary benefit of the Multilateral System under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) is indeed that of having facilitated global access to germplasm and that this concept will remain an important guiding principle during further implementation of the Treaty.",2016,Agriculture

Chronic HCV infection may in the long run cause cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma, with an ultimate disease burden of at least 350,000 deaths per year worldwide. The new generation of highly effective direct acting antivirals (DAA) to treat HCV infection brings major promises to infected patients in terms of exceedingly high rates of sustained virological response (SVR) but also of tolerability, allowing even the sickest patients to be treated. Even in the face of the excellent safety and efficacy and wide theoretical applicability of these regimens, their introduction is currently facing cost and access issues denying their use to many patients in need. Health systems in all countries are facing a huge problem of distributive justice, since while they should guarantee individual rights, among which the right to health in its broader sense, therefore not limited to healing, but extending to quality of life, they must also grant equal access to the healthcare resources and keep the distribution system sustainable. In the face of a disease with a relatively unpredictable course, where many but not of all chronically infected will eventually die of liver disease, selective allocation of this costly resource is debatable. In most countries the favorite solution has been a stratification of patients for prioritization of treatment, which means allowing Interferon-free DAA treatment only in patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, while keeping on hold persons with lesser stages of liver disease. In this report, we will perform an ethical assessment addressing the issues linked to access to new therapies, prioritization and eligibility criteria, analyzing the meaning of the term distributive justice and the different approaches that can guide us (individualistic libertarianism, social utilitarianism and egalitarianism) on this specific matter. Even if over time the price of new DAA will be reduced through competition and eventual patent expiration, the phenomenon of high drug costs will go on in the next decades and we need adequate tools to face the problems of distributive justice that come with it.",2016,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

This study determines whether MHPAEA was associated with increased BH expenditures and utilization among a population with substance use disorder (SUD) diagnoses. Methods: Claims and eligibility data from 5,987,776 enrollees, 2008-2013, were obtained from a national, commercial, managed behavioral health organization. An interrupted time series study design with segmented regression analysis estimated time trends of per-member-per-month (PMPM) spending and use before (2008-2009), during (2010), and after (2011 2013) MHPAEA compliance. The study sample contained individuals with drug or alcohol use disorder diagnosis during study period (N = 2,716,473 member-month observations). Outcomes included: total, plan, patient out-of-pocket spending; outpatient utilization (assessment/diagnostic evaluation visits; medication management; individual, group and family psychotherapy, and structured outpatient care); intermediate care utilization (day treatment; recovery home and residential); and inpatient utilization. Results: Starting at the beginning of the post-parity period, MHPAEA was associated with increased levels of PMPM total and plan spending ($25.80 [p = 0.01]; $2833 [p = 0.00], respectively), as well as the number of PMPM assessment/evaluation, individual psychotherapy, and group psychotherapy visits, and inpatient days (0.01 visits [p = 0.01]; 0.02 visits [p = 0.01]; 0.01 visits [p = 0.03]; 0.01 days [p = 0.01], respectively). Following these initial level changes, MHPAEA was also associated with monthly increases in PMPM total, plan, and patent out-of-pocket spending ($2.56/month [p = 0.00]; $2.25/month [p = 0.00]; $027 [p = 0.03], respectively), as well as structured outpatient visits and inpatient days (0.0012 visits/month [p = 0.01]; 0.0012 days/month [p = 0.00]). Conclusion: MHPAEA was associated with modest increases in total, plan, and patient out-of-pocket spending and outpatient and inpatient utilization. These increases, while modest in magnitude, are larger in magnitude than increases detected among a sample of all enrollees (i.e. not only those with SUD diagnoses).

Methods: This observational study of chronic hepatitis C patients was carried out at Doctors Hospital and Medical Center (DH&MC). After diagnostic workup, Sofosbuvir/ribavirin for 24 weeks or sofosbuvir/ribavirin/pegylated interferon for 12 weeks were prescribed. Primary outcome was negative HCV RNA by PCR 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR 12). Chi square chi(2) and student's t test were used to analyze data. Results: Of 216 patients included, liver cirrhosis was present in 112 (51.9%) patients and 69(31.9%) were treatment experienced. Liver disease was decompensated in 37 (17.1%) patients. Of 206 patient who completed study protocol, 173(83.1%) achieved SVR12, 89.2% (25/28) with triple therapy and 82.2% (148/180) with sofosbuvir/ribavirin therapy. Treatment response was similar between treatment naive 86.2% (119/138) and treatment experienced 79.4% (54/68) patents. (p value 0.19) SVR12 was inferior in cirrhosis patients 75.4% (80/106) as compared to those with no cirrhosis 93% (93/100) (p value < 0.000). It was even lesser in those with decompensated liver disease 68.8% (24/35) (p value < 0.000). Conclusion: Treatment outcome with sofosbuvir/ribavirin combination therapy in cirrhosis patients is suboptimal especially in those with decompensation as compared to patients without liver cirrhosis.",2017,General & Internal Medicine
Influence of Nanocellulose Additive on the Film Properties of Native Rice Starch-based Edible Films for Food Packaging,Food packaging; rice starch; edible film; nanocomposite; nanocellulose; water vapour permeability; tensile strength; film solubility; film colour; CELLULOSE NANOCRYSTALS; NANOCOMPOSITE FILMS; PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; BARRIER PROPERTIES; THERMOPLASTIC STARCH; CASSAVA STARCH; BANANA; EXTRACTION; BIOPOLYMER,"Background & Objective: Starch-based edible films, which are transparent, odourless, biodegradable, tasteless, and semi-permeable to gases and food additives, have attracted the attention of the research community as the alternative food packaging materials to synthetic plastics. However, they pose poor water resistance and mechanical strength that should be improved for food packaging application. Few relevant patents to the topic have been reviewed and cited. Methods: Inclusion of nanoadditives in starch films can not only improve their mechanical and barrier properties but also can act as antimicrobial agent, oxygen scavenger, and biosensor. The present investigation is focussed on the effects of nanocellulose extracted from banana pseudostems on the film properties of rice starch-based edible films. Nanocellulose was extracted from dried banana pseudostems through isolation of cellulose and acid hydrolysis. Rice starch-based edible films were prepared through solution casting by adding nanocellulose of varying concentrations (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% & 10%). Results: The film properties, such as Water Vapour Permeability (WVP), mechanical strength (tensile strength, Young's modulus and percentage of elongation), film solubility in water and film colour, were determined. The test results were discussed and the effects of nanocellulose additives were studied. Conclusion: From the results, it was clear that the addition of nanocellulose had improved the film properties, making the rice starch-based edible films a promising choice for food packaging applications.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics

As a result of the work, clothing enriched with green tea and Viola tricolor extracts enclosed in ethyl cellulose microcapsules was produced. The microcapsules were applied on the inner surface of linen knitted fabric, which ensured direct contact of the active substances with the patients' affected skin. The efficiency of the clothing was tested according to our own methodology, which included wearing tests, microbiological tests of the skin and tests of skin moisture, transepidermal water loss and itching intensity. Also, the effect of the active substances present on the fabrics on the in vitro culture of human keratinocytes was evaluated. The test results confirmed that linen clothing enriched with medicinal plant extracts enclosed in microcapsules had an effect on the reduction of itching intensity, an increase in skin moisture, reduction of transepidermal water loss and a reduction of pathogenic bacterial colonies residing on the patients' skin. They confirmed that the new method of administering herbal substances to the skin of dermatological patients via the wearing of functional clothing is effective and leads to symptom relief. The studies allowed for the filing of a patent submission, number P 411869, titled The clothing acting as a dressing supplement in the therapy of dermatological diseases.",2019,Materials Science
Drivers and Barriers to Drug Discovery: Insights from a Cross-sectional Survey,Drug discovery; Eroom's law; Innovation systems; Pharmaceutical innovation; R&D trend; Survey; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION SYSTEMS; FAILURE; RATES,"Motivated by stagnant new drug approval rates, this study explores the drivers and barriers to drug discovery to extract policy-relevant advice. As part of a doctoral dissertation, an online survey was administered to drug discovery experts between July and November 2017. Respondents came from patents, startup managers/founders, conference speakers, consultants, and LinkedIn profiles, contingent on finding respondent emails from a web search. Respondents ranked drivers and barriers to drug discovery and judged R&D and drug approval trends. Pooling responses based on frequency of mentions, indicate that respondents deem skilled R&D scientists, R&D investments, and good R&D management as the top three drivers of drug discovery. The depth of specialized knowledge is mentioned more than the diversity of knowledge available to the discovery team. Likewise, complex clinical trials, companies pursuing the same drug targets, and designing drug substances with a single or narrow therapeutic benefits are top ranked barriers to drug discovery. The majority view is that R&D spending has been stagnant for the past decade. New drug approval trend is judged to be improving in the past 5 years. Ninety percent of respondents believe their responses are generalizable to other therapeutic areas, indicating instrument's validity in capturing general drug discovery issues. There are traces of hard and soft institutional problems, firm capability development failures, networking failures, and institutional rigidities (i.e., lock-in failures) in the drug discovery innovation system.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
"Copyright Trolling, An Empirical Study",; JOHN,"This detailed empirical and doctrinal study of copyright trolling presents new data showing the astonishing rate of growth of multi-defendant John Doe litigation in United States district courts over the past decade. It also presents new evidence of the association between this form of litigation and allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films. Multi-defendant John Doe lawsuits have become the most common form of copyright litigation in several U.S. districts, and in districts such as the Northern District of Illinois, copyright litigation involving pornography accounts for more than half of new cases. This Article highlights a fundamental oversight in the literature on copyright trolls. Paralleling discussions in patent law, scholars addressing the troll issue in copyright have applied status-based definitions to determine who is, and is not, a troll. This Article argues that the definition should be conduct-based. Multi-defendant John Doe litigation should be considered copyright trolling whenever it is motivated by a desire to turn litigation into an independent revenue stream. Such litigation, when initiated with the aim of turning a profit in the courthouse as opposed to seeking compensation or deterring illegal activity, reflects a kind of systematic opportunism that fits squarely within the concept of litigation trolling. This Article shows that existing status-based definitions of copyright trolls do not account for what is now arguably the most prevalent form of trolling. In addition to these empirical and theoretical contributions, this Article shows how statutory damages and permissive joinder make multi-defendant John Doe litigation possible and why allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films are particularly well-suited to this model.",2015,Government & Law

They replaced the more toxic barbiturates, which were commonly used for treatment of anxiety or sleep disorders at the time. However, benzodiazepines show a high potential of misuse and dependence. Although being of great value as medicines, dependence to these drugs is a concern worldwide, in part due to overprescription and easy availability. Therefore, the phenomenon of benzodiazepines sold via Internet shops without restrictions at low prices is alarming and poses a serious threat to public health. Most of these compounds (with the exception of, e.g., phenazepam and etizolam) have never been licensed as medical drugs in any part of the world and are structurally derived from medically used benzodiazepines. Strategies of clandestine producers to generate new compounds include typical structural variations of medically used 1,4-benzodiazepines based on structure-activity relationships as well as synthesis of active metabolites and triazolo analogs of these compounds. As they were obviously designed to circumvent national narcotics laws or international control, they can be referred to as designer benzodiazepines. The majority of these compounds, such as diclazepam, clonazolam, and nitrazolam, have been described in scientific or patent literature. However, little is known about their pharmacological properties and specific risks related to their use. This chapter describes the phenomenon of designer benzodiazepines and summarizes the available data on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as analytical approaches for their detection.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology

Furthermore, training using cadaver is advocated as a means of transferring learned skills to the operating room and recreate surgical situations for trainees to practice and hone their skills. We expose our experience in training for cardiac surgical procedures using human cadavers. MethodsFrom June 2013 to November 2016, we performed 302 cardiac surgical procedures on 50 human cadavers obtained according to the Ivorian laws in force. Cadavers were preserved in 10% formaldehyde and by cryopreservation. ResultsIn open heart, cardiac surgical techniques were achieved via sternotomy (n=24) or via lid-anterolateral thoracotomy (n=2). Pericardotomy (n=26) and/or pericardiectomy (n=26) were systematic. Aortic and caval canulations and pulmonary artery control (n=30) were performed. After cardiotomy and arterial incisions (n=34), 18 atrial and ventricular septal defects repair, 1 Fontan operation, 1 arterial switch, 11 enlargement procedures of the whole right ventricular outlet and 15 acquired valve heart diseases corrections were performed. In closed-heart surgery, procedures were achieved via sternotomy (n=7), posterolateral thoracotomy (n=12), or Marfan retroxiphoid approach (n=3). Pericardotomy (n=7) or pericardiectomy (n=7) were performed. Great vessels dissections and expositions (n=21) were achieved to perform 4 pulmonary artery bandings, 12 patent ductus arteriosus closures, 3 Waldhausen procedures, 7 Brock Operations, and 2 Blalock-Taussig shunts. In both situations, 29 direct pulmonary arterial, auricular, and ventricular sutures were achieved.

Evolutionary Model and Simulation Research of Collaborative Innovation Network: A Case Study of Artificial Intelligence Industry,; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS,"Based on integrating the fundamental attribute and the unique property of the collaborative innovation network, this paper establishes a collaborative innovation network model of Artificial Intelligence industry through depicting external stimulus conversion progresses and behaviors of network heterogeneous agents. Heterogeneous agents are the network elements of the model which regards the stimulus response as the evolutionarymechanism. Tencent is one of the largest Internet integrated service providers and one of the Internet companies with the largest number of service users in China, which has also set its sights on the development of the AI industry. Taking Tencent's patent cooperation network in the field of Artificial Intelligence as an example and using system simulation method, we analyze the evolutionary law of the collaborative innovation network topology structure, the coupling evolution phenomenon of the knowledge and the network topology structure, distinct roles that agents play in the network, and relationship between the agents' openness and the knowledge flow efficiency. We find the phenomenon of small world emergence more than once through the evolution of collaborative innovation network, whose degrees and reasons are also distinctive. There exists coupling evolution between the technological knowledge and the network structure. The collaborative innovation network is always oriented towards competitive industries. The agents' openness has an essential influence on the lifting range of the technological knowledge. Strengthening themain position of enterprises in AI technological innovation and enhancing the degree of openness among heterogeneous agents are a powerful guarantee for improving the performance of collaborative innovation.",2018,Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics

Despite expiration of patent coverage, no generic product for the LD has been approved in the USA, likely due to the complexity of components and manufacturing processes involved in the product. Here, we describe the reverse engineering of the LD composition and important product attributes. Specific attributes analyzed for microspheres were as follows: leuprolide content by three methods; gelatin content, type, and molecular weight distribution; PLGA content, lactic acid/glycolic acid ratio, and molecular weight distribution; mannitol content; in vitro drug release; residual solvent and moisture content; particle size distribution and morphology; and glass transition temperature. For the diluent, composition, viscosity, and specific gravity were analyzed. Analyzed contents of the formulation and the determined PLGA characteristics matched well with the official numbers stated in the package insert and those found in literature, respectively. The gelatin was identified as type B consistent with similar to 300 bloom. The 11-m volume-median microspheres in the LD slowly released the drug in vitro in a zero-order manner after similar to 23% initial burst release. Very low content of residual moisture (<0.5%) and methylene chloride (< 1 ppm) in the product indicates in-water drying is capable of removing solvents to extremely low levels during manufacturing. The rigorous approach of reverse engineering described here may be useful for development of generic leuprolide-PLGA microspheres as well as other new and generic PLGA microsphere formulations.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
The university image: a model of overall image and stakeholder perspectives,University; higher education; image; stakeholders; formative measurement model; measurement invariance; HIGHER-EDUCATION; ORGANIZATIONAL IMAGE; INDEX CONSTRUCTION; SATISFACTION; REPUTATION; LOYALTY; IMPACT; INDICATORS; COVARIANCE; PRESTIGE,"In order to further knowledge regarding the factors that have most influence on the university image, a measurement model was established in this research from the perspective of society and validated using covariance structure analysis. In addition, to ascertain whether such factors and/or their degree of influence differ among stakeholders, an evaluation of measurement invariance was conducted to find out what implications there are for image formation when the perspectives of the different stakeholders are considered. Five samples of stakeholders were used (society, prospective students, current students, graduates, and companies), totaling 1760 respondents. The results showed that affective image, perception of teaching resources, and perception of graduate training significantly influence the formation of overall university image from the perspective of society and that the image structure identified from this perspective is shared by companies, although some differences are observed. However, the model needs adapting to consider the perspectives of prospective students, current students, and graduates. The results also suggested that affective issues have a major importance in image formation from the perspective of all the stakeholders considered and that it is in the cognitive aspects where differences between them become more patent. These findings constitute a valuable contribution for marketing literature as so few works have addressed the study of the university image adopting the standpoint of society or the comparison of different stakeholders. Further, they provide guidance to university managers when determining which aspects are recommendable to act upon for the projection of a favorable image to various audiences.",2019,Business & Economics
Anti-thrombosis Effects and Mechanisms by Xueshuantong Capsule Under Different Flow Conditions,shear stress; endothelial cells; thrombosis; inflammation; Xueshuantong capsule; PANAX-NOTOGINSENG; SHEAR-STRESS; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; DIFFERENT PARTS; ADHESION; EXPRESSION; SAPONINS; ACTIVATION; EXTRACTION; PATHWAY,"Xueshuantong capsule (XST) is a patented traditional Chinese medicine used for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. The molecular mechanism of anti-thrombotic effect of XST was investigated through the cross-talk among the platelets/leukocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), and flow shear stress. The Bioflux 1000 system was used to generate two levels of shear stress conditions: 0.1 and 0.9 Pa. Bioflux Metamorph microscopic imaging system was used to analyze the adhesion cell numbers. Protein expressions were detected by western blotting and flow cytometry. The flow-cytometry results showed that under 0.1 Pa flow, XST decreased ADP induced platelets CD62p surface expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Under 0.9 Pa flow, XST at a concentration of 0.15 g.L-1 reduced the platelets activation by 29.5%, and aspirin (ASA) showed no inhibitory effects. XST showed similar efficiency on monocytes adhesion both under 0.1 and 0.9 Pa flow conditions, and the inhibition rate was 30.2 and 28.3%, respectively. Under 0.9 Pa flow, the anti-adhesive effects of XST might be associated with the suppression of VE-cadherin and Cx43 in HUVECs. Blood flow not only acts as a drug transporter, but also exerts its effects to influence the pharmacodynamics of XST. Effects of XST on inhibiting platelets activation and suppressing platelets/leukocytes adhesion to injured ECs are not only concentration-dependent, but also shear stress-dependent. The mechanic forces combined with traditional Chinese medicine may be used as a precise treatment for cardiovascular diseases.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Enhancing the Pediatric Drug Development Framework to Deliver Better Pediatric Therapies Tomorrow,drug development; innovation; pediatric; policy; MEDICINES; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; EXPOSURE; PROGRAM; CANCER; ACT,"Health care professionals involved in the clinical management of children have long appreciated the limited number of therapies suitably evaluated for their optimal use in the pediatric population. In the past century, advances in regulatory policy significantly evolved adult drug evaluation. The scarcity of available patient populations, practical complexities of drug development research, and minimal financial returns have hampered pharmaceutical investment in the study of therapies for children. More recently, pediatric policy and legislation in the United States and Europe have instituted a system of obligations and incentives to stimulate investment in pediatric drug development. These initiatives, in conjunction with a more sophisticated process of drug discovery and development, have led to significant advancements in the labeling of drugs for pediatric use. Facilitated by the emergence of new targets, precision medicine, and innovations in regulatory science, there is now a subtle shift in focus toward drug development research for children rather than simply in children. Although there has been an increase in pediatric studies of investigational agents and labeling of pediatric information for use, there have been unintended consequences of existing policies. As a result, limited progress has been made in certain therapeutic areas and for off-patent therapies. Future policy reform to enhance the availability and accessibility of pediatric medicines should not only reflect an understanding not only of the successes of existing policy and legislative initiatives but also constructively address failures and unintended consequences. Taken together, policy reform, global cooperation, and innovation in regulatory science will more ably deliver better pediatric therapies tomorrow. (C) 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

In this work, untargeted quantitative metabolic profiling in adult and juvenile needles of four water-deficit stressed P. pinaster genotypes was investigated to know if metabolic responses to drought are genotype-dependent and vary according to the stage of needle ontogeny. Among the changes in metabolome, it highlights the increase of osmotically active substances, as well as the overproduction of antioxidant compounds by up-regulating ascorbate, shikimate/phenylalanine and phenylpropanoid metabolic pathways. Moreover, significant inter-clonal quantitative variations were also found at different levels, in both primary and secondary metabolism pathways, although terpenoids and specially flavonoids showed the highest significance. A surprising result was the ontogenetic changes in metabolic profiles. Juvenile needles contain significant higher levels of UV screener and antioxidant flavonoids. The level of drought tolerance of a genotype and the ontogenetic stage were important factors in determining the drought-induced level of flavonoid increase in needles of a given genotype. Regarding terpenoids, the significant drought-induced accumulation of neutral diterpenes in juvenile needles, and mono- and sesquiterpenes in adults, was genotype dependent regardless its degree of drought tolerance. These results point to flavonoids as very versatile metabolites in maritime pine needle, acting like important compounds modulating not only drought acclimation but also changes in needle metabolism associated with developmental processes such as heteroblasty.",2017,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

A uniquely prolonged patency of sphenoethmoidal synchondrosis or prespheno-septal synchondrosis (PSept) has been attributed to humans. However, the sphenoethmoidal junction has not been studied using a comparative primate sample. Here, we examined development of the sphenoethmoidal interface using ontogenetic samples of Old and New World monkeys, strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises), and a comparative sample of other mammals. Specimens ranging from late fetal to 1month postnatal age were studied using histology, immunohistochemistry, and micro-computed tomography methods. Our results demonstrate that humans are not unique in anterior cranial base growth at PSept, as it is patent in all newborn primates. We found two distinctions within our sample. First, nearly all primates exhibit an earlier breakdown of the nasal capsule cartilage that abuts the orbitosphenoid when compared to nonprimates. This may facilitate earlier postnatal integration of the basicranium and midface and may enhance morphological plasticity in the region. Second, the PSept exhibits a basic dichotomy between strepsirrhines and monkeys. In strepsirrhines, the PSept has proliferating chondrocytes that are primarily oriented in a longitudinal plane, as in other mammals. In contrast, monkeys have a convex anterior end of the presphenoid with a radial boundary of cartilaginous growth at PSept. Our findings suggest that the PSept acts as a pacemaker of longitudinal facial growth in mammals with relatively long snouts, but may also contribute to facial height and produce a relatively taller midface in anthropoid primates.

Use of multifunctional phosphorylated PAMAM dendrimers for dentin biomimetic remineralization and dentinal tubule occlusion,; DEMINERALIZED HUMAN DENTIN; CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE; IN-VITRO; INTERFACIAL ENERGY; COLLAGEN FIBRILS; CRYSTAL-GROWTH; OSTEOPONTIN; HYDROXYAPATITE; SURFACE; INHIBITION,"The disequilibrium between demineralization and remineralization of teeth, especially of dentin, may lead to serious consequences like dental caries that are considered to affect people's quality of life. The employment of biomimetic analogs of proteins to duplicate biomineralization, which is a well-regulated process mediated by extracellular matrix proteins, may provide new insights to solve these problems. Here we report the use of a modified multifunctional dendrimer, synthesized by the introduction of phosphate groups via a Mannich-type reaction onto poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers, to biomimetically remineralize dentin. The phosphorylated PAMAM dendrimers were demonstrated to act, along with an amorphous calcium phosphate stabilizing agent, polyacrylic acid (PAA), as biomimetic analogs of noncollagenous proteins to induce the remineralization of demineralized dentin. Phosphorylated PAMAM dendrimers treated demineralized dentin discs were immersed in a remineralizing solution containing PAA for up to 7 days. The success of this remineralization was examined using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron microscopy. These results showed that demineralized dentinal collagen fibrils were successfully phosphorylated by the treatment of phosphorylated PAMAM dendrimers and embedded with calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite after remineralization. The surfaces of demineralized dentin discs were covered with newly induced crystals and the patent dentinal tubules were occluded. A good biocompatibility was also determined. Thus, phosphorylated PAMAM dendrimers could be applied as a minimally invasive method of management of dentin caries, employed to improve the resin-dentin bonding stability and also be used in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity.",2015,Chemistry
Mid-esophageal bicaval versus short-axis view of interatrial septum in two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography for diagnosis and measurement of atrial septal pouches,atrial fibrillation; cryptogenic stroke; interatrial septum; left-sided septal pouch; patent foramen ovale; septal pouch; CRYPTOGENIC STROKE; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; RISK-FACTOR; THROMBUS,"BackgroundRecent studies suggest that the left-sided septal pouch (SP) may increase the risk of cryptogenic stroke and act as an arrhythmogenic substrate. The aim of this study was to compare two transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) projections of the interventricular septum: mid-esophageal bicaval and short-axis views toward evaluating their ability to detect SPs. Materials and methodsA total of 146 patients with both bicaval and short-axis TEE views were included in this study. The presence of SPs was determined, and they were evaluated for morphology. ResultsIrrespective of TEE projection view, the left SP was detected in 74 cases (50.7%), right SP in 16 cases (11.0%), and double in one case (0.7%). Agreement between both projections occurred in 119 cases (81.5%) with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.68 (good agreement). We detected more left SPs from the bicaval view compared to the short-axis view; however, the observed difference was statistically insignificant (72 vs 59, P=.13). The detection of right SPs was higher in the short-axis view, but also statistically insignificant (9 vs 13, P=.38). Bland-Altman analysis revealed a significant difference in the left SP depth with higher values in the bicaval than short-axis view (systematic difference=1.17mm, LoA: -4.88-7.22mm, P=.02, ICC=0.58). ConclusionsThe mid-esophageal bicaval view should be preferable over mid-esophageal short-axis view of interatrial septum for the diagnosis and measurement of the left SP.",2018,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology

The invention establishes that the FKBP52-Tau interaction provides a new target that may be used advantageously for novel therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders involving Tau dysfunction, and especially for Alzheimer's disease. Areas covered: The invention generally relates to neuroprotection and repair in neurological disorders involving Tau dysfunction (including Alzheimer's disease). The invention describes a direct interaction between FKBP52 and Tau, the screening methods for molecules acting on the FKBP52-Tau interaction, in order to modulate the detrimental effect of pathogenic Tau. Finally, it discusses therapeutic, diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring assays of neurological disorders involving Tau dysfunction. Expert Opinion: Several methods or techniques were used to determine the validity of screening methods, involving biochemistry, immunology, fluorescence analysis and cell experiment. Candidate compounds mentioned in the patent include FK506 derivatives, rapamycin derivatives and pipecolyl-alpha-keto-amid compounds. However, the mechanism, the structural similarity and the biological activity were unmentioned, which may partly reduce the practicability of the invention. The FKBP52-Tau interaction as a novel target for neurodegenerative diseases is promising. FKBP52 is capable of preventing polymerization of tubulin and maintaining axonal transport. In AD patients' brain, the high level of Tau protein phosphorylation is directly related to the decrease of FKBP52. The FKBP52-Tau interaction may provide a new critical path for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and new molecules will possess higher affinity and efficiency.",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Stem cell impregnated nanofiber stent sleeve for on-stent production and intravascular delivery of paracrine factors,Stem cell; Nanofiber; Coronary artery disease; Peripheral artery disease; Paracrine factor; CARDIOSPHERE-DERIVED CELLS; ENDOTHELIAL PROGENITOR CELLS; IMPROVE MYOCARDIAL-FUNCTION; POSEIDON RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; BONE-MARROW; ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY; TRANSENDOCARDIAL INJECTION; RE-ENDOTHELIALIZATION; PHASE-1 TRIAL; REGENERATION,"Stem cell therapies for atherosclerotic diseases are promising, but benefits remain modest with present cell delivery devices in part due to cell washout and immune attack. Many stem cell effects are believed mediated by paracrine factors (PFs) secreted by the stem cells which potentiate tissue repair via activation and enhancement of intrinsic host repair mechanisms We therefore sought to create an intravascular paracrine factor factory by harnessing stem cells on a stent using a nanofiber (NF) stent sleeve, and thus providing a sheltered milieu for cells to continuously produce PFs on-stent. The NF sleeve acts as a substrate on which stem cells grow, and as a semi-permeable barrier that protects cells from washout and host immune response while allowing free outward passage of PFs. NF stent sleeves were created by covering stents with electrospun poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid nanofibers and were then uniformly coated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). NF sleeves blocked cell passage but did not hamper MSC attachment or proliferation, and did not alter MSC morphology or surface markers. NF sleeve MSCs continued to secrete PFs that were biologically active and successfully induced tubulogenesis in human endothelial cells. NF stent sleeves seeded with allogeneic MSCs implanted in pigs remained patent at 7 days without thrombotic occlusion or immune rejection. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of creating an intravascular PF factory using a stem cell impregnated NF stent sleeve, and pave the way for animal studies to assess the efficacy of local PF production to treat ischemic artery disease.

Open innovation search in manufacturing firms: the role of organizational slack and absorptive capacity,Manufacturing firms; Absorptive capacity; Open innovation; Organizational slack; Open search strategy; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE SEARCH; INBOUND OPEN INNOVATION; DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES; MODERATING ROLE; EXAMINER CITATIONS; PATENT CITATIONS; LOCAL SEARCH; HIGH-TECH; PERFORMANCE,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore organizational factors that act as antecedents of open innovation search. The authors aim to empirically examine whether the extent to which the organizational slack is absorbed determines its influence on firms' openness in innovation search. In addition, the authors also examine the moderating effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between slack and open innovation search. Design/methodology/approach - This study adopted secondary data from multiple sources (NBER, Compustat and US census) and then constructed a ten-year balanced panel dataset of 298 manufacturers. The generalized least square method was used to explore the determinants of open innovation search among manufacturing firms. Findings - The results of this study reveal that the absorption level of organizational slack indeed determines the openness in innovation search. Specifically, absorbed slack negatively affects a firm's openness in innovation search, whereas unabsorbed slack promotes open innovation search. Additionally, the relationship between absorbed slack and open innovation search will be less negative with the increase of absorptive capacity. Originality/value - Different from most previous studies that have examined the performance effect of open search among high-tech and large enterprises, this study focuses on the antecedents of open search strategy in both high-and low-tech, large and small firms. The findings reveal that different forms of organizational slack divergently influence a firm's open search strategy, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between organizational slack and knowledge search behavior in a broader context, as well as the understanding of the moderating effect of absorptive capacity.",2017,Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics
Phenotypic screening of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs identified mefenamic acid as a drug for the treatment of schistosomiasis,Schistosomiasis; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Mefenamic acid; Anthelmintic; Schistosomicidal activity; ANTISCHISTOSOMAL ACTIVITY; ANTIPARASITIC ACTIVITY; DISCOVERY; MANSONI; COMBINATIONS; DICLOFENAC; AGENTS; LEAD,"Background: Treatment and control of schistosomiasis, one of the most insidious and serious parasitic diseases, depend almost entirely on a single drug, praziquantel. Since the funding for drug development for poverty-associated diseases is very limited, drug repurposing is a promising strategy. In this study, 73 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) commonly used in medical and veterinary fields were evaluated for their anti-schistosomal properties. Methods: The efficacy of NSAIDs was first tested against adult Schistosoma mansoni ex vivo using phenotypic screening strategy, effective drugs were further tested in a murine model of schistosomiasis. The disease parameters measured were worm and egg burden, hepato- and splenomegaly. Findings: From 73 NSAIDs, five (mefenamic add, tolfenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, celecoxib, and diclofenac) were identified to effectively kill schistosomes. These results were further supported by scanning electron microscopy analysis. In addition, the octanol-water partition coefficient, both for neutral and ionized species, revealed to be a critical property for the ex vivo activity profile. Compounds were then tested in vivo using both patent and a prepatent S. mansoni infection in a mouse model. The most effective NSAID was mefenamic acid, which highly reduced worm burden, egg production, and hepato- and splenomegaly. interpretation: The treatment regimen used in this study is within the range for which mefenamic acid has been used in dinical practice, thus, it is demonstrated the capacity of mefenamic acid to act as a potent anti-schistosomal agent suitable for dinical repurposing in the treatment of schistosomiasis.

Leveraging domestic and foreign learning to develop marketing capabilities The case of the Chinese company Goodbaby,China; International marketing; Emerging market multinationals; Chinese multinational firms; Internationalization; Chinese firms; KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT; INTERNATIONALIZATION; FIRMS; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; OPPORTUNITIES; EXPLOITATION; EXPLORATION; ENTERPRISES; TRANSITION,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of different learning sources in the process of capability building of Chinese firms (CFs) approaching international markets. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the case study of the company Goodbaby. The primary data sources are two semi-structured interviews with one of the firm's managers, which have been triangulated with point of sale visits, interviews with industry experts, and secondary data such as corporate records, patent and trademark data, industry reports and news articles. Findings - Both the home-country and foreign markets act as sources of learning to support the development of CFs' marketing capabilities. Learning at home is triggered by the complexity of the national market and the exposure to foreign entrants. Foreign learning is stimulated by the relationships with leading foreign partners and the exposure to advanced final markets. Moreover, each learning source has a positive effect on the development of CFs' marketing capabilities in both market contexts in which they compete, i.e. the home-market and international markets. Practical implications - CFs' managers should be simultaneously receptive to the domestic and foreign contexts, as both may support the development of marketing capabilities. CFs' managers should recognize the learning opportunities embedded in each of these contexts, and identify the markets where these can be effectively redeployed. Originality/value - The authors distinguish between different sources of learning in the context of CFs' internationalization, and explore their triggering factors and their role in the development of an underinvestigated type of capabilities, i.e. the marketing capabilities.",2017,Business & Economics
Passive aircraft cooling systems for variable thermal conditions,Loop thermosyphon; Cooling system; Variable thermal conditions; Fuselage; Air conditioning; Condenser; Avionics; AVIONICS,"A novel design for a heat exchanger system [1], for which a patent application has been filed, was experimentally evaluated in the laboratory under variable thermal conditions characteristic of an aircraft in operation. The passive heat exchanger prototype consists of a loop-thermosyphon with two condensers and a common evaporator. Water was applied as the working fluid. Natural convection, forced convection and a combination of forced and natural convection at each condenser were replicated. The fuselage condenser performance was tested at temperatures ranging from 30 to 50 degrees C with heat transfer coefficients ranging from natural convection to values of around 200 W/(m(2) K). Air supply to the air conditioning condenser was kept at 20 degrees C with coefficients ranging from natural convection to around 50 W/(m(2) K). Input power up to 900 W was provided to the evaporator section by an embedded electrical resistance. Cooling system malfunction is not observed when the water within the fuselage heat sink is frozen, for input power below 300 W. Under cruise flight conditions, the cooling system is able to dissipate 900 W maintaining vapor temperatures at around 41 degrees C. The evaporator temperature increases by approximately 0.014 degrees C/W when start-up occurs. Refrigeration on the ground requires air duct speeds of around 6.1 m/s to keep the vapor temperatures below 100 degrees C for an input power of ca. 1 kW. When forced convection acts in both condensers, the heat removal capacity of the fuselage heat sink is dominant (around 90%). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Arterial Ischemic Stroke Secondary to Cardiac Disease in Neonates and Children,Pediatric stroke; Pediatric arterial ischemic stroke; Cardiac disease; Stroke; Embolism; Cardiac procedure; CONGENITAL HEART-DISEASE; SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT; THROMBOSIS; RISK; PREVALENCE; INFANTS,"Objective: We describe the risk factors for peri-procedural and spontaneous arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in children with cardiac disease. Methods: We identified children with cardiac causes of AIS enrolled in the International Pediatric Stroke Study registry from January 2003 to July 2014. Isolated patent foramen ovale was excluded. Periprocedural AIS (those occurring during or within 72 hours of cardiac surgery, cardiac catheterization, or mechanical circulatory support) and spontaneous AIS that occurred outside of these time periods were compared. Results: We identified 672 patients with congenital or acquired cardiac disease as the primary risk factor for AIS. Among these, 177 patients (26%) had peri-procedural AIS and 495 patients (74%) had spontaneous AIS. Among non-neonates, spontaneous AIS occurred at older ages (median 4.2 years, interquartile range 0.97 to 12.4) compared with peri-procedural AIS (median 2.4 years, interquartile range 0.35 to 6.1, P < 0.001). About a third of patients in both groups had a systemic illness at the time of AIS. Patients who had spontaneous AIS were more likely to have a preceding thrombotic event (16 % versus 9 %, P = 0.02) and to have a moderate or severe neurological deficit at discharge (67% versus 33%, P = 0.01) compared to those with peri-procedural AIS. Conclusions: Children with cardiac disease are at risk for AIS at the time of cardiac procedures but also outside of the immediate 72 hours after procedures. Many have acute systemic illness or thrombotic event preceding AIS, suggesting that inflammatory or prothrombotic conditions could act as a stroke trigger in this susceptible population.

The dimensions outlined in Goffman (1979) and some aspects of Kress and van Leeuwen's (1996, 2006) metafunctions are taken as a starting point to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse a sample of 155 ads which depict women and men in working settings. Findings indicate that women are mainly portrayed in non-remunerated scenarios, in home settings and in the company of their children. This view is reinforced thanks to the multimodal dimensions of framing (mostly through close-ups), involvement with other participants through looks, smiling and profuse touching activity. Men, in contrast, are mostly depicted in remunerated scenarios in which they address the audience directly through demand looks, acting as experts in their professional capacity and framed with medium and long shots. When portrayed together in non-remunerated activities, men are found in family scenes, although they are sometimes portrayed as passive subjects and mere objects of contemplation through lack of interaction with children or spouses. This contrasts with women's more communal role as they are intimately depicted in the company of their children through close-ups, feminine touch, and constant interaction with them. Stereotyped portrayals are less visually patent when both men and women are simultaneously depicted in remunerated scenarios, although some ads emphasize women's interpersonal skills as better at talking to customers or patients, whereas men are shown in the role of experts in financial and medical issues.",2018,Linguistics
An Empirical Model of Drug Detailing: Dynamic Competition and Policy Implications,pharmaceutical marketing; detailing competition; dynamic oligopoly game; dynamic programming; detailing cost; restrictions on detailing; regulation; ADVERTISING STRATEGIES; PRESCRIBING DECISIONS; PRESCRIPTION DRUGS; PATENT EXPIRATION; CHOICE; OLIGOPOLY; BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; MARKETS; PROMOTION,"The practice of detailing in the marketing of prescription drugs is undergoing significant changes. For instance, in September 2013, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act went into full effect. The accompanying transparency requirements have prompted physician practices and hospitals to severely restrict pharmaceutical sales representatives' direct access to their physicians. Despite all the attention in the popular press, scant scholarly research has investigated how these restrictions on physician access impact physician prescription behavior and competitive detailing to physicians. To analyze the impact of these restrictions, we develop a structural model of how pharmaceutical firms compete dynamically to schedule detailing to physicians. Detailing activities are known to have significant carryover effects that are captured in a first-stage model of physicians' demand for prescription drugs. We also specify detailing policy functions that describe each firm's observed detailing actions. In a second stage, we estimate a model that describes costs of detailing, assuming that the observed detailing levels are consistent with a Markov perfect Nash equilibrium. The estimated structural model is used to examine the implications of restrictions on the amount of detailing via counterfactual simulations. We find that restriction policies would increase the market share of a nondrug-treatment-only option but impact firms asymmetrically; firms that are strong in detailing and/or rely more on detailing would be hurt more. Unexpectedly, a policy that imposes a ceiling on detailing frequency could significantly reduce detailing of all firms in the market, including those firms with average detailing levels below the ceiling, and effectively would soften competition between firms and enhance their profits.",2016,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
Disulfiram when Combined with Copper Enhances the Therapeutic Effects of Temozolomide for the Treatment of Glioblastoma,; TUMOR-INITIATING CELLS; P75 NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR; CANCER STEM-CELLS; ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; IN-VITRO; BRAIN; INHIBITION; LINES; DRUG,"Purpose: Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal cancers in humans, and with existing therapy, survival remains at 14.6 months. Current barriers to successful treatment include their infiltrative behavior, extensive tumor heterogeneity, and the presence of a stem-like population of cells, termed brain tumor-initiating cells (BTIC) that confer resistance to conventional therapies. Experimental Design: To develop therapeutic strategies that target BTICs, we focused on a repurposing approach that explored already-marketed (clinically approved) drugs for therapeutic potential against patient-derived BTICs that encompass the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of glioblastoma observed clinically. Results: Using a high-throughput in vitro drug screen, we found that montelukast, clioquinol, and disulfiram (DSF) were cytotoxic against a large panel of patient-derived BTICs. Of these compounds, disulfiram, an off-patent drug previously used to treat alcoholism, in the presence of a copper supplement, showed low nanomolar efficacy in BTICs including those resistant to temozolomide and the highly infiltrative quiescent stem-like population. Low dose DSF-Cu significantly augmented temozolomide activity in vitro, and importantly, prolonged in vivo survival in patient-derived BTIC models established from both newly diagnosed and recurrent tumors. Moreover, we found that in addition to acting as a potent proteasome inhibitor, DSF-Cu functionally impairs DNA repair pathways and enhances the effects ofDNAalkylating agents and radiation. These observations suggest that DSF-Cu inhibits proteasome activity and augments the therapeutic effects of DNA-damaging agents (temozolomide and radiation). Conclusions: DSF-Cu should be considered as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma in both newly diagnosed and recurrent settings. (C) 2016 AACR.",2016,Oncology
Using CorMatrix for partial and complete (re)construction of arteriovenous fistulas in haemodialysis patients: (Re)construction of arteriovenous fistulas with CorMatrix,Arteriovenous fistula; extracellular matrix; haemodialysis; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX CORMATRIX; SMALL-INTESTINAL SUBMUCOSA; PRELIMINARY EXPERIENCE; VALVE REPAIR; RISK-FACTORS; ACCESS; RECONSTRUCTION; SCAFFOLDS; CONDUIT; SURGERY,"Introduction: CorMatrix is an acellular extracellular matrix that acts as a biological scaffold and remodels into site-specific tissue. We used it for the (re)construction of arteriovenous fistulas. Methods: In this prospective pilot case study, we used CorMatrix in six patients. We included patients who required vascular access reconstruction due to thrombosis of unsalvageable arteriovenous fistulas, patients with high-flow arteriovenous fistulas and patients with microvasculature in which autologous arteriovenous fistulas did not mature, requiring reconstruction with a graft. We sutured the CorMatrix plate into a tubular shape and then constructed arterial and venous anastomoses. Results: There were no periprocedural complications, CorMatrix-related infections, bleeding or limb swelling after the procedures. CorMatrix was first punctured after 8-10 weeks. In five patients, a percutaneous angioplasty due to CorMatrix stenosis was performed; in one patient, a stent was placed due to refractory stenosis. We observed eight thromboses during the observation period (four in one patient). Perianastomotic stenosis of CorMatrix and interdialytic hypotension were the causes of the thrombosis in five patients, cephalic arch stenosis in two patients and thromboembolism to the brachial artery and arteriovenous fistula in one patient. Thrombendarteriectomy was successful in 87.5% of patients, and one patient required arteriovenous fistula reconstruction. After a median observation period of 12.5 (range 4-23) months, all arteriovenous fistulas were patent, with a median brachial artery flow of 1450 (range 700-1700) mL/min. Conclusion: Arteriovenous fistula (re)construction with CorMatrix seems to be feasible and safe, with a relatively high incidence of neointimal hyperplasia, predominantly at venous anastomoses, but additional clinical studies are needed.",2019,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Optic nerve integrity as a visuospatial cognitive predictor in Parkinson's disease,Parkinson's disease; Optic nerve; Diffusion tensor image; Cognition; MULTIPLE-SYSTEM ATROPHY; CARDIAC I-123-MIBG; DEMENTIA; HALLUCINATIONS; ASSOCIATION; DYSFUNCTION; PREVALENCE; ALZHEIMERS; PATTERNS; NEURITIS,"Objective: To explore the microstructural integrity of the optic nerve and its role as a cognitive predictor in patients with de novo Parkinson's disease (PD) using diffusion tensor image-based magnetic resonance scans. Methods: We enrolled 82 patients with de novo PD, 36 patients with drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP), and 36 controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured on the mid-portion of the intraorbital optic nerve. Using a multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures, longitudinal changes in cognitive subscores of a comprehensive neuropsychological test were evaluated in PD patients according to optic nerve integrity. Results: The mean FA value in PD was significantly lower (0.552 0.103, p < 0.001) than that in DIP (0.645 +/- 0.099) or the controls (0.689 +/- 0.089), whereas the mean ADC value was significantly higher in the PD group compared to the DIP or control group (p < 0.001). Optic nerve integrity was not associated with parkinsonian motor severity, striatal dopamine transporter activity, olfaction, or baseline cognitive performance in PD patents. In a longitudinal assessment of cognition in PD, the lower FA group showed significant decline in the performance of Clock Drawing Test (F = 3.39, p = 0.038), but no significant differences in the other cognitive subsets. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that microstructural integrity in the optic nerve was distorted in PD patients, and that this nerve integrity might act as a cognitive predictor of visuospatial dysfunction.

Anti-amnesic Effect of Leea indica Extract in Scopolamine-induced Amnesia of Alzheimer's Type in Rats,Leea indica; anterograde amnesia; Alzheimer's disease; scopolamine; neurodegenerative; memory deficits; ,"Background and Objective: Amnesia is one of the major complications associated with memory loss in the patents of neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study investigated the potential of Leea indica extract in amnesia of Alzheimer's type induced in by scopolamine rats. Materials and Methods: Scopolamine was administered at a dose of 3 mg kg(-1), i.p. (One time before and after to study anterograde and retrograde amnesia) to rats for four days and then divided into different groups. Group I considered as control, Group II as Negative control, Group III animals represented Piracetam (120 mg kg(-1), i.p.) treated group and Group IV were administered the dose of 500 mg kg(-1) (p.o) of methanolic extract of Leea indica (MELI), followed by scopolamine after 45 min. All the animals after 30 min of scopolamine administration were subjected to morris water maze test. On last day of trial, all animals were dissected and subjected to estimate different biochemical estimations like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase. AchE, TNF-alpha and mono amine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B) were also estimated. Results: Scopolamine produced a marked decline in escape latency time and increased the TNF-alpha in both retrograde and anterograde amnesia and also effect on various other biochemical parameters of brain and brain tissues. The MELI act as MAO-B inhibitor and effected on TNF-alpha, acetylcholine esterase enzyme, in cognitive dysfunctions associated with experimental amnesia in rats. The MELI and Piracetam treated animal showed reduction in AchE and elevation SOD and catalase in retrograde and anterograde amnesia. Conclusion: So this study concluded that MELI significantly modulated the induced memory deficits, biochemical alterations.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Orthopaedic Surgeons Receive the Most Industry Payments to Physicians but Large Disparities are Seen in Sunshine Act Data,; CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST; MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY; PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES; INTEREST DISCLOSURES; INTEREST-POLICIES; NATIONAL-SURVEY; TRANSPARENCY; DIFFERENCE; ACCURACY; IMPACT,"Industry payments made to physicians by drug and device manufacturers or group purchasing organizations are now reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a part of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. Initial reports from the program show that orthopaedic surgeons lead all physician specialties in total and average industry payments. However, before further discussion of these payments and their implications can take place, it remains to be seen whether these figures are a true reflection of the field of orthopaedic surgery in general, rather than the result of a few outlier physicians in the field. In addition, the nature and sources of these funds should be determined to better inform the national dialogue surrounding these payments. We asked: (1) How do industry payments to orthopaedic surgeons compare with payments to physicians and surgeons in other fields, in terms of median payments and the Gini index of disparity? (2) How much do payments to the highest-receiving orthopaedic surgeons contribute to total payments? (3) What kind of industry payments are orthopaedic surgeons receiving? (4) How much do the highest-paying manufacturers contribute to total payments to orthopaedic surgeons? We reviewed the most recent version of the CMS Sunshine Act Open Payments database released on December 19, 2014, containing data on payments made between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. Data on total payments to individual physicians, physician specialty, the types of payments made, and the manufacturers making payments were reviewed. The Gini index of statistical dispersion was calculated for payments made to orthopaedic surgeons and compared with payments made to physicians and surgeons in all other medical specialties. A Gini index of 0 indicates complete equality of payments to everyone in the population, whereas an index of 1 indicates complete inequality, or all income going to one individual. A total of 15,376 orthopaedic surgeons receiving payments during the 5-month period were identified, accounting for USD 109,846,482. The median payment to orthopaedic surgeons receiving payments was USD 121 (interquartile range, USD 34-619). The top 10% of orthopaedic surgeons receiving payments (1538 surgeons) received at least USD 4160 and accounted for 95% of total payments. Royalties and patent licenses accounted for 69% of all industry payments to orthopaedic surgeons. Even as a relatively small specialty, orthopaedic surgeons received substantial payments from industry (more than USD 110 million) during the 5-month study period. Whether there is a true return of value from these payments remains to be seen; however, future ethical and policy discussions regarding industry payments to orthopaedic surgeons should take into account the large disparities in payments that are present and also the nature of the payments being made. It is possible that patients and policymakers may view industry payments to orthopaedic surgeons more positively in light of these new findings.

Costs of switching to low global warming potential inhalers. An economic and carbon footprint analysis of NHS prescription data in England,; ASTHMA MANAGEMENT,"Objectives Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) contain propellants which are potent greenhouse gases. Many agencies propose a switch to alternative, low global warming potential (GWP) inhalers, such as dry powder inhalers (DPIs). We aimed to analyse the impact on greenhouse gas emissions and drug costs of making this switch. Setting We studied National Health Service prescription data from England in 2017 and collated carbon footprint data on inhalers commonly used in England. Design Inhalers were separated into different categories according to their mechanisms of action (eg, short-acting beta-agonist). Within each category we identified low and high GWP inhalers and calculated the cost and carbon impact of changing to low GWP inhalers. We modelled scenarios for swapping proportionally according to the current market share of each equivalent DPI (model 1) and switching to the lowest cost pharmaceutically equivalent DPI (model 2). We also reviewed available data on the carbon footprint of inhalers from scientific publications, independently certified reports and patents to provide more accurate carbon footprint information on different types of inhalers. Results If MDIs using HFA propellant are replaced with the cheapest equivalent DPI, then for every 10% of MDIs changed to DPIs, drug costs decrease by 8.2M pound annually. However if the brands of DPIs stay the same as 2017 prescribing patterns, for every 10% of MDIs changed to DPIs, drug costs increase by 12.7M pound annually. Most potential savings are due to less expensive long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)/inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) inhalers. Some reliever inhalers (eg, Ventolin) have a carbon footprint over 25 kg CO(2)e per inhaler, while others use far less 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA134a) (eg, Salamol) with a carbon footprint of <10 kg CO(2)e per inhaler. 1,1,1,2,3,3, 3-Heptafluoropropane (HFA227ea) LABA/ICS inhalers (eg, Flutiform) have a carbon footprint over 36 kg CO(2)e, compared with an equivalent HFA134a combination inhaler (eg, Fostair) at <20 kg CO(2)e. For every 10% of MDIs changed to DPIs, 58 kt CO(2)e could be saved annually in England. Conclusions Switching to DPIs would result in large carbon savings and can be achieved alongside reduced drug costs by using less expensive brands. Substantial carbon savings can be made by using small volume HFA134a MDIs, in preference to large volume HFA134a MDIs, or those containing HFA227ea as a propellant.",2019,General & Internal Medicine
Overcoming Problems at Elaboration and Scale-up of Liquid-Phase Pd/C Mediated Catalytic Hydrogenations in Pharmaceutical Production,; ROSENMUND REDUCTION; ALDEHYDES,"The practical solutions for scale-up and production of intermediates or precursors of pharmaceuticals by liquid phase Pd/C mediated hydrogenation can be of considerable interest and deserve broader attention even if they have not been the focus of previously published research due to regulations of patent law. The practical obstacles are persistent and have been known for a long time, but for the most part remained unpublished. The most important discoveries and solutions that contributed to the successful scale-up of hydrogenations for pharmaceutical production were the following: (i) the poisoning of Pd/C catalyst with Fe2+ ions for the selective hydrogenation of 2,6-dimethyl-1-nitrosopiperidine to the corresponding hydrazo compound; (ii) alloying of the deposited Pd metal with Cu for converting the aromatic acid chlorides into the corresponding aldehydes; (iii) alteration of the pH of the reaction mixture to basic values which enhanced the stereoselectivity of paracetamol hydrogenation; (iv) a useful modification of the catalyst preparation process, i.e, the acidification of the catalyst resulted in the hydrogenolysis of benzylic OH in a molecule containing a basic N atom; (v) use of two liquid phases, altogether a four-phase system, which permitted the hydrogenolysis of the S-S bond in a potential catalyst poisoning molecule; (vi) the preservation of the metallic Pd surface of the catalyst by saturation of the reaction mixture with hydrogen, resulting in a high H-2/substrate ratio, increased the aldehyde yield in the hydrogenation of 4-chloro-butyric-acid-chloride by avoiding the unwanted poisoning effect of the hydrochloric acid. In the present article, these problems and their solutions, as they emerged during the scale-up of the processes, will be discussed in detail.",2016,Chemistry
Examining US approvals of Islamic financing products and the Islamic theory of lawful profit,Islamic banking; Murabahah; Ijarah; Musharakah mutanaqisah; ,"Purpose - This paper aims to analyze the legal interpretation of three Islamic financing products considered for approval by US authorities, from the United Bank of Kuwait and Guidance Residential, even though the USA has not enacted any Shari'ah legislation in relation to the Islamic law of transactions (fiqh mu'amalat). Design/methodology/approach - This paper primarily adopted qualitative document and content analysis, supported by quantitative numerical analysis, in reviewing legal interpretive letters from the US Office of the Comptroller of Currency and National Administrator of Banks (OCC) and the US Department of Revenue. Findings - The research found that in assessing economic substance over legal form, each of the three products involved risk-free transactions and interest. Research limitations/implications - The research had access to published OCC, Department of Revenue and US Patent Office material that fully disclosed the mechanics of each of the selected products. Practical implications - The implication for the Islamic financial institutions involves Shari'ah compliance risk. When tested against the Islamic normative theory of lawful profit, it confirms that the products are non-compliant. Social implications - The social implication is customer awareness of Shari'ah non-compliance in the USA and the impact for other jurisdictions carrying the same products. Originality/value - The significance of this research for Islamic banking product design and development is that it enhances the ability to block the legal means to an unlawful outcome (sadd al-dhara'i), thereby avoiding harm (al-darar) attributed to usury (riba), and upholding what is in the public interest (maslahah), to fulfil one of the objectives of the Shari'ah (maqasid al-Shari'ah), which is to protect wealth (hafiz al-mal).",2016,Business & Economics

Practical value. The design has been developed and the relative boundaries of changes in the modules of elasticity and loss of hinges with magnetorheological elastomers during their control have been determined which will make it possible to formulate requirements for elastomers when developing promising hinge designs for vehicle suspension systems.",2019,Engineering
A Comparative Study on Different Pharmaceutical Industries and Proposing a Model for the Context of Iran,Pharmaceutical industry; Growth and development policies; Health; Qualitative study; Iran; TURKEY,"Medication is known as the main and the most effective factor in improving public health. On the other hand, having a strong and effective pharmaceutical industry will, to a very large extent, guarantee people's health. Therefore, this study was prospected to review the different pharmaceutical industries around the world and propose a model for the context of Iran. This is a qualitative as well as a comparative study which was carried out in 2015. At the first stage, using the World Bank website, countries were divided into four groups of low-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income economies. Then, four countries of Afghanistan, India, Brazil, and Canada were chosen from these four groups, respectively. Secondly, data gathered from these countries were given to two 12-member expert panels. Finally, using the articles and the results of expert panel groups, useful and effective policies were extracted for the growth and development of Iran's pharmaceutical industry. Findings of the study indicated that the following seven items are the essential policies for the context of Iran: establishment of high academic centers as well as research institutes, using weak patent law, supporting research and development centers at universities and pharmaceutical companies, backing national pharmaceutical companies up, implementing generic rules, gradual economic liberalization, and membership in world trade organization. Since, pharmaceutical industry is an effective and inseparable part of every health system, proper and evidence-based policies should be taken into account in order to develop this industry and, ultimately, meet the public needs.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
The idiosyncrasy of research and development efficiency across types of small- and medium-sized enterprises: evidence from Korea,; PRODUCT INNOVATIVENESS; SECTORAL PATTERNS; GIBRATS-LAW; TECHNOLOGY; SMES; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; FIRMS; INNOVATIONS,"Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are considered to be the main driving force behind economic and employment growth. However, the low productivity levels of SMEs cannot be explained by lower levels of R&D investment, but are instead a consequence of a lack of research and development (R&D) efficiency that would have been adequate for making firms more competitive. To investigate any differences in R&D efficiency that impact the company overall performance in economic and employment performance, we analyze various types of SMEs in Korea. This paper applies two estimation methods: data envelopment analysis and regression analysis. This study takes three relevant factors of output: (1) the number of patents, (2) the number of success in terms of technology development, and (3) the level of profit attained through new products. Additionally, the study's model incorporates three parts of input: (1) human resources, (2) development periods, and (3) R&D budget. In the context of this paper, a comparison of the factors regarding efficiency is performed based upon the following criteria: the level of novelty, the length of a product's life cycle, and the time period of a competitor emulation of the product created by original enterprise. Comparing the factors that influence the efficiency of types within each criterion is meaningful in analyzing the differences in efficiency outcome on the various types among SMEs. Our findings indicate that SMEs vary among types in terms of efficiency and that there are also differences causing factors according to types.",2015,Business & Economics
"Availability and rationality of fixed dose combinations available in Kaduna, Nigeria",Drug Combinations; Drug Therapy; Combination; Medication Adherence; Developing Countries; Nigeria; DRUG-COMBINATIONS; INDIA,"Background: Fixed-dose drug combinations (FDCs), are combinations of two or more active drugs in a single dosage form. Despite the advantages obtained from the use of these agents, there is increasing evidence questioning the rationality of several FDCs found in pharmaceutical markets-especially those in developing countries like Nigeria. Objectives: To describe the availability of FDC5 in drug retailing outlets located in Kaduna Nigeria, and to assess FDC registration status and inclusion on national and international essential medicines lists (EM Ls). Rationality of selected FDCs was also assessed. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out from June to September 2018 in 60 registered pharmacies and patent medicine shops selected through multi-stage sampling. A data collection form was used to obtain information on the generic names and strengths of the active ingredients of the FDCs, their country of manufacture and evidence of registration with the Nigerian drug regulatory agency. To assess rationality, a scoring rubric developed from earlier studies was used. Data collected was coded and entered into a Microsoft excel 2016 spreadsheet for analysis. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) were used to report the data collected. Results: FDCs encountered included 74 oral tablets/capsules, 52 oral liquids and 23 topical semi solids. Majority of the available FDC5 were registered by Nigerian drug regulatory agency (91.5%), although only 8.5% and 6.5% in total were included on the Nigerian EML and the WHO model list respectively. Of the 99 FDCs assessed for rationality, 58 (58.6%) were found to be rational. Irrational FDCs included drugs acting on the respiratory tract (29.3%), analgesics (26.8%) and anti-infectives (22%). Conclusions: A wide variety of FDCs were available in the study area, even though not all of them were rational. There is an urgent need for policy makers within the country to develop better detailed guidelines for FDC registration.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
"Luther Burbank: Plant Breeding Artist, Horticulturist, and Legend",; ,"Luther Burbank (1849-1926), the best-known horticulturist in the United States, was honored in 1940 by having a U.S. postage stamp in his honor as a scientist! Burbank became a legend in his time as the plant inventor and horticultural wizard releasing a prodigious 800 new cultivars, a number of which are still being grown, the most famous being the 'Burbank' potato, the 'Santa Rosa' plum, and the 'Shasta' daisy. During his lifetime he was considered as a coequal with Henry Ford, inventor of the assembly line factory, and Thomas A. Edison, inventor of the light bulb and phonograph. Hugo de Vries, Liberty Hyde Bailey, and Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov visited him and lauded his operation. Burbank promoted the concept that plant breeding could be the basis of a business and his headquarters in Santa Rosa, CA, became world famous. He established a publication company to disseminate his work and was instrumental in the eventual passage of the Plant Patent Act of 1930. However, Burbank was not a scientist. Although a strong supporter of Darwin and the theory of natural selection, he did not understand the contributions of Mendel to genetics and breeding. He performed no experiments in the classical sense and his notes were fragmentary. In 1904, he received a large grant from the Carnegie Institution ($10,000 annually) to promote the scientific study of plant breeding, which was discontinued after 5 years when the reviewer, George Harrison Shull, determined that Burbank's procedure was more art than science. However, Burbank is justly famous as a successful plant breeder. He intuitively followed the modern rationale of plant breeding by obtaining abundant diversity, using repeated and successive hybridization, and carrying out rigorous selection. Above all he had an eye and feel for plants. His success is an affirmation that plant breeding is an art as well as a science. As an innovative plant breeding artist, Luther Burbank remains an inspiration to plant breeders and horticulturists.",2015,Agriculture

Methods: Both iliac veins of 5 pigs were implanted with SailValve devices; the first animal was an acute pilot experiment to show the feasibility of accurately positioning the SailValve via a femoral access. The other 4 animals were followed for 2 weeks (n=2) or 4 weeks (n=2) under a chronic implantation protocol. Patency and valve function were evaluated directly in all animals using ascending and descending phlebography after device placement and at termination in the chronic implant animals. For reasons of clinical relevance, a regimen of clopidogrel and calcium carbasalate was administered. Histological analysis was performed according to a predefined protocol by an independent pathologist. Results: Deployment was technically feasible in all 10 iliac veins, and all were patent directly after placement. No perioperative or postoperative complications occurred. Ascending phlebograms in the follow-up animals confirmed the patency of all valves after 2 or 4 weeks. Descending phlebograms showed full function in 5 of 8 valves. Limited reflux was seen in 1 valve (4-week group), and the function in the remaining 2 valves (2-week group) was insufficient because of malpositioning. No macroscopic thrombosis was noted on histology. Histology in the follow-up groups revealed a progressive inflammatory reaction to the valves. Conclusion: This animal study shows the potential of the SailValve concept with sufficient valve function after adequate positioning and no (thrombogenic) occlusions after short-term follow-up. Future research is essential to optimize valve material and long-term patency.",2017,Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Evaluation with micro-CT of different anticoagulation strategies during hemodialysis in patients with thrombocytopenia: A randomized crossover study,anticoagulation; bleeding disorder; fiber blocking; fiber patency; hemodialysis; heparin-coated; HEPARIN-BINDING; MEMBRANE; DIALYSIS; AN69ST,"In patients with enhanced risk for bleeding, heparin-free hemodialysis (HD) with conventional dialyzers is routinely used. To explore the potential benefit of using heparin-coated dialyzers, we used a reference CT-scanning technique and registered different clotting parameters to quantify coagulation with heparin-coated versus non-coated dialyzers. Six HD patients with thrombocytopenia were dialyzed 240min in a randomized crossover study with Evodial 1.3 or FX600 Cordiax, each without anticoagulation. Blood samples were taken from the vascular access predialysis, and from the dialyzer inlet and outlet at 5 and 240min after dialysis start. Predialysis blood samples were analyzed for hemoglobin, hematocrit, thrombocytes, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time. On dialyzer inlet and outlet blood samples, a viscoelastic measurement of blood coagulation was performed using a Sonoclot analyzer. After dialysis, dialyzers were visually scored, subsequently dried for 24h, weighed, and scanned with micro-CT at a resolution of 25 mu m. After image reconstruction, the open, non-coagulated fibers were counted in a representative cross-section at the dialyzer outlet. No sessions were terminated prematurely for circuit clotting. Heparin-coated dialyzers had more patent fibers on micro-CT versus non-coated dialyzers and also had a better score of subjective visual assessment of fiber clotting. There was no difference in subjective assessment of clotting at the venous drip chamber. With both dialyzers, all ACT values remained in the normal range, and were lower at the dialyzer outlet versus inlet. In conclusion, dialysis with a heparin-coated versus non heparin-coated membrane results in substantially less coagulated fibers during 4h hemodialysis without systemic anticoagulation. Eventual leaching of heparin, immobilized on the fiber membrane, does not result in measurable systemic anticoagulation.",2019,Engineering; Transplantation
Atrial Function after the Atrial Switch Operation for Transposition of the Great Arteries: Comparison with Arterial Switch and Normals by Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,Atrial Function; Venous Baffle; Atrial Switch Operation; Transposition of the Great Arteries; Systemic Right Ventricle; PATENT FORAMEN OVALE; COR-TRIATRIATUM DEXTER; EUSTACHIAN VALVE; INTRACARDIAC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; FOLLOW-UP; CLOSURE; STROKE,"Objectives. The atria serve as reservoir, conduit, and active pump for ventricular filling. The performance of the atrial baffles after atrial switch repair for transposition of the great arteries may be abnormal and impact the function of the systemic right ventricle. We sought to assess atrial function in patients after atrial repair in comparison to patients after arterial switch repair (ASO) and to controls. Methods. Using magnetic resonance imaging, atrial volumes and functional parameters were measured in 17 patients after atrial switch repair, 9 patients after ASO and 10 healthy subjects. Results. After the atrial switch operation, the maximum volume of the pulmonary venous atrium was significantly enlarged, but not of the systemic venous atrium. In both patients groups, independently from the surgical technique used, the minimum atrial volumes were elevated, which resulted in a decreased total empting fraction compared with controls (P<.01). The passive empting volume was diminished for right atrium, but elevated for left atrium after atrial switch and normal for left atrium after ASO; however, the passive empting fraction was diminished for both right atrium and left atrium after both operations (P<.01). The active empting volume was the most affected parameter in both atria and both groups and active empting fractions were highly significantly reduced compared with controls. Conclusion. Atrial function is abnormal in all patients, after atrial switch and ASO repair. The cyclic volume changes, that is, atrial filling and empting, are reduced when compared with normal subjects. Thus, the atria have lost part of their capacity to convert continuous venous flow into a pulsatile ventricular filling. The function of the pulmonary venous atrium, acting as preload for the systemic right ventricle, after atrial switch is altered the most.",2016,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Effect of Gold Chloride Concentration and Volume on Size and Shape of Biological Synthesized Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) Using Red Algae (Laurencia papillosa),Gold Nanoparticles; AuNPs; Red Algae; Laurencia papillosa; ImageJ; TEM; FESEM; AFM; XRD; FTIR; XPS; SILVER NANOPARTICLES,"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were successfully synthesized using an eco-friendly method in a single-step reaction with red algae (Laurencia papillosa). In this research we investigated the factors that affect the characteristics of AuNPs, such as the size, shape, surface profile and surface chemistry. The synthesized AuNPs were characterized using UV-Visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Field Emission Scanning Electron microscope (FESEM), and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) measurements. Computational analysis of the size distribution, surface profile, area and value of the different AuNPs synthesized were carried out using freeware ImageJ. The study revealed that the color of the solutions of HAuCl4 was changed from yellow to ruby red indicating that metallic gold nanoparticles were synthesized. TEM images of the synthesized AuNPs showed different shapes and sizes ranging from 3.5 to 53 nm at lambda(max) = 586 nm in different concentrations (Graphical Abstract). The resulting shapes were spherical and triangular crystalline gold nanoparticles with varied oxidation states of Au (0) and Au (+1). One of our future goals in Plant Virology is the use of these gold nanoparticles as a carrier in biological control of plant virus diseases using viral satellite RNA as a biological control agent against severe plant virus diseases (United States Patent No. US 8,138,390 B2). The functional groups in the algal extract responsible for the synthesis of the AuNPs were identified to be NH2+ and OH-groups. The optimum ratio of Au/Algal extract required for producing small sizes of AuNPs was found to be 1:2. The Algal water-extract has dual functions in this synthesis-: they act as reducing and stabilizing agent. AuNPs have many biological, industrial and medical applications which include treatments against plant virus and cancer diseases.",2017,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics
Tamoxifen from Failed Contraceptive Pill to Best-Selling Breast Cancer Medicine: A Case-Study in Pharmaceutical Innovation,synthetic anti-estrogen; contraceptive pill; breast cancer; chemoprevention; risk evaluation and management; adjuvant therapy; DANISH ADJUVANT TRIALS; TRANS ISOMERS; THERAPY; WOMEN; CIS; ICI,"Today, tamoxifen is one of the world's best-selling hormonal breast cancer drugs. However, it was not always so. Compound ICI 46,474 (as it was first known) was synthesized in 1962 within a project to develop a contraceptive pill in the pharmaceutical laboratories of ICI (now part of AstraZeneca). Although designed to act as an anti-estrogen, the compound stimulated, rather than suppressed ovulation in women. This, and the fact that it could not be patented in the USA, its largest potential market, meant that ICI nearly stopped the project. It was saved partly because the team's leader, Arthur Walpole, threatened to resign, and pressed on with another project: to develop tamoxifen as a treatment for breast cancer. Even then, its market appeared small, because at first it was mainly used as a palliative treatment for advanced breast cancer. An important turning point in tamoxifen's journey from orphan drug to best-selling medicine occurred in the 1980s, when clinical trials showed that it was also useful as an adjuvant to surgery and chemotherapy in the early stages of the disease. Later, trials demonstrated that it could prevent its occurrence or re-occurrence in women at high risk of breast cancer. Thus, it became the first preventive for any cancer, helping to establish the broader principles of chemoprevention, and extending the market for tamoxifen and similar drugs further still. Using tamoxifen as a case study, this paper discusses the limits of the rational approach to drug design, the role of human actors, and the series of feedback loops between bench and bedside that underpins pharmaceutical innovation. The paper also highlights the complex evaluation and management of risk that are involved in all therapies, but more especially perhaps in life-threatening and emotion-laden diseases like cancer.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Data of preterm infants born at 32 weeks of gestation or less were reviewed. The development of PH and other respiratory outcomes were compared according to the presence of HC. Potential risk factors associated with the development of PH during NICU stay were used for multivariable logistic regression analysis. A total of 188 infants were enrolled: 72 in the HC group and 116 in the no HC group. The HC group infants were born at a significantly shorter gestational age and lower birthweight, with a greater proportion presenting preterm premature rupture of membrane (pPROM)>18h before delivery. More infants in the HC group developed pneumothorax (P=0.008), and moderate and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; P=0.001 and P=0.006, respectively). PH in the HC group was significantly more frequent compared to the no HC group (25.0% versus 8.6%, P=0.002). Based on a multivariable logistic regression analysis, birthweight (P=0.009, odds ratio [OR]=0.997, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.995-0.999), the presence of HC (P=0.047, OR=2.799, 95% CI=1.014-7.731), and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV)>14 days (P=0.015, OR=8.036, 95% CI=1.051-43.030) were significant factors. The presence of HC and prolonged invasive MV in infants with lower birthweight possibly synergistically act against preterm pulmonary outcomes and leads to the development of PH. Verification of this result and further investigation to establish effective strategies to prevent or ameliorate these adverse outcomes are needed.",2018,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System
Developing a Highly Active Blood Anticoagulant-a Heparin Complex with Glutamic Acid-by Simulating Chemical Equilibria Based on pH-Metric Data,high-molecular-weight heparin; glutamic acid; mathematical simulation of chemical equilibria; mixed ligand complex of Ca2+ with heparin and glutamate; MIXED-LIGAND COMPLEXATION; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; MERCURY(II) ETHYLENEDIAMINETETRAACETATE; POTENTIOMETRIC TITRATION; ADENOSINE-TRIPHOSPHATE; PHYSIOLOGICAL SOLUTION; THERMODYNAMICS; MAGNESIUM; POLARIMETRY; COMPOUND,"The anticoagulant activity of high-molecular-weight heparin is increased by developing a new highly active heparin complex with glutamate using the thermodynamic model of chemical equilibria based on pH-metric data. The anticoagulant activity of the developed complexes is estimated in the pH range of blood plasma according to the drop in the calculated equilibrium Ca2+ concentration associated with the formation of mixed ligand complexes of Ca2+ ions, heparin (Na(4)hep), and glutamate (H(2)Glu). A thermodynamic model is calculated by mathematically modelling chemical equilibria in the CaCl2-Na(4)hep-H(2)Glu-H2O-NaCl system in the pH range of 2.30 ae pH ae 10.50 in diluted saline that acts as a background electrolyte (0.154 De NaCl) at 37A degrees C and initial concentrations of the main components of nu x 10(-3) M, where n ae 4.

Molecular diagnosis of acute and chronic infection of Trypanosoma evansi in experimental male and female mice,Trypanosoma evansi; acute; chronic; mice; PCR; polymerase chain reaction; organs; PCR ASSAY; CAMELS; TESTS; BLOOD; DNA,"Trypanosoma evansi is enzootic in camels in Egypt, and water buffaloes act as a reservoir for camel infection. Molecular techniques have contributed towards understanding the epidemiology of T. evansi. Trypanosoma evansi was detected in acute and chronic stages of the disease in male and female mice by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two primers. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment I, two groups consisting of 26 female and 26 male mice received 10(4) trypanosome by I/P inoculation for each mouse. In experiment II, 42 female and 42 male mice were inoculated I/P with 10(2) trypanosome/mouse. In addition, five mice were kept as uninfected control for each group. Mice were monitored daily for parasitaemia level during the pre-patent period using the micro-haematocrit centrifugation technique (MHCT) and conventional PCR. The primer pairs, (Trypanosoma brucei) TBR1/2 and TeRoTat1.2 (T. evansi Rode Trypanozoon antigen type [RoTat] 1.2), detected the infection after 24 hours earlier than MHCT in both experiments. The course of infection that was detected by MHCT revealed three waves of parasitaemia in female mice and two waves in male mice in the chronic stage of infection. In addition, PCR was able to detect T. evansi in different organs in the chronic stage (i. e. disappearance of parasite from blood). Application of the two primer sets on blood samples from camels showed that all samples were positive by TBR1/2 primers and only 32 of 44 were positive by TeRoTat1.2 primers. Acutely and chronically Trypanosoma-infected mice were detected by PCR in blood and organs. TBR1/2 primers were more sensitive than TeRoTat1.2 primers in detecting Trypanosoma-infected mice, and more reliable in detecting field-infected camels and excluding carrier animals.",2019,Veterinary Sciences
Public health-oriented intellectual property and trade policies in Africa and the regional mechanism under Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights amendment,Public health; TRIPS agreement; Access to medicines; Regional mechanism; TRIPS FLEXIBILITIES; INTERNATIONAL-LAW,"Objective: The short communication is prompted by the debate relating to the effect of pharmaceutical patents on access to affordable medicines, particularly in Africa. A recent amendment made to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement creates a policy space for the regional alliance of low-income countries for the collective procurement and local production of drugs under compulsory licensing. This article examines the extent to which the regional mechanism can deliver access to pharmaceuticals. The article examines the regional mechanism in the light of the recent regional trade agreements and pharmaceutical plans of some regional economic blocs in Africa as well as the newly signed African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA). Study design: This short communication adopts a descriptive approach in linking the regional mechanism in the TRIPS amendment to the regional trade agreements of African countries at the subregional and continental levels. Methods: To ascertain the extent to which TRIPS Agreements regional model can deliver access to medicines in Africa, the article adopts a desk review approach by examining the relevant provisions of TRIPS Agreement, particularly the newly added Article 31bis, and the provisions of the relevant regional and continental free trade agreements in Africa. Results: The article finds that although the regional model has great prospects in supporting the wider effort to deliver access to medicine, the limitations to its operative utilization may weaken its potency in addressing the urgent public health needs of the continent. Conclusion: The article concludes by stressing the inevitability of Africa's integration in tackling the deficiency of access to generic medicines in Africa. It was noted that even though there could be some potential challenges, the regional mechanism is indeed the way to go for low-income countries. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

FREE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID-GAS PHASE SEPARATION AS A MEASURING MEMBRANE OF A DEVICE FOR MEASURING SMALL HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE DIFFERENCE VALUES,small values of differential pressure measurement; filtration; pressure gauges; ,"To obtain a correct reading of fluid flow through a porous medium, it is necessary to know the pressure distribution. While in the case of large Reynolds numbers (turbulent flows) finding pressure measurement devices on the market is not a major problem, there are currently no available devices with sufficient accuracy for measurement of laminar flows (i.e. for Re numbers (Bear, 1988; Duckworth, 1983; Troskolanski, 1957) in the range from 0.01 to 3). The reasons of this situation has been discussed in a previous articles (Broda & Filipek, 2012, 2013). Therefore, most of the work on this issue relates to testing velocity distribution of the filter medium (Bear, 1988) or pressure distribution at high hydraulic gradient levels (Trzaska & Broda, 1991, 2000; Trzaska et al., 2005). The so-called measurements of the lower limit of the applicability of Darcy's law for liquid, as well as determining a threshold hydraulic gradient J(0) (Bear, 1988) tend to cause especially great difficulty. Such measurements would be particularly important application in determining the infiltration of water into the mine workings, filtering through the foundations of buildings, etc. For several years, the authors (Broda & Filipek, 2012, 2013) have been engaged in the development of methods and measuring instruments (patent applications: P. 407 380 and P. 407 381), which would allow for measurement of hydrostatic pressure (differences) below 1 Pa. In the course of research, a new concept of methodology for measuring low values of hydrostatic pressure differences was developed, which is the subject of this article. This article seeks to introduce a new concept of using the free surface of liquid-gas separation as the measuring membrane of a device used in measurement of small values of hydrostatic pressure. The focus is mainly on the possibility of building such a device - describing the technical difficulties that occurred during the execution of the idea. Consequently, less attention was paid to the broader considerations related to uncertainty of the proposed method's measurements, due to the authors' awareness that this is the first prototype of such a device and, on the basis of this experience, another one will be built and tested. The observations and numerical analysis of the image formed on the screen by the passage of a laser beam through the free surface of the liquid-gas separation show that at low values of pressure difference, the bubble acts as a membrane shifting in the direction of lower pressure, in such way that the displacement is proportional to the pressure difference at both ends of the bubble. The proprietary method of numerical data processing presented in this article, based on analysis of the intensity of color change in a frame moving along a selected line outside of visual changes in the image of the laser beam after passing through the test structure, provided a tool to create first mathematical models to describe the observed changes (2),(3). Presented in this article method of measuring the difference between the free surface levels in two containers, and hence the measurement of hydrostatic pressure difference provides a new tool for laboratory measurements in the fields of science, which were previously unattainable.",2015,Mining & Mineral Processing

Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these treatments under different assumptions about their price and efficacy. Design: Discrete-event simulation. Data Sources: Published literature. Target Population: Treatment-naive patents infected with chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, or 3. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Usual care (boceprevir-ribavirin-pegylated interferon [PEG]) was compared with sofosbuvir-ribavirin-PEG and 3 PEG-free regimens: sofosbuvir-simeprevir, sofosbuvir-daclatasvir, and sofosbuvir-ledipasvir. For genotypes 2 and 3, usual care (ribavirin-PEG) was compared with sofosbuvir-ribavirin, sofosbuvir-daclatasvir, and sofosbuvir-ledipasvir-ribavirin (genotype 3 only). Outcome Measures: Discounted costs (in 2014 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Assuming sofosbuvir, simeprevir, daclatasvir, and ledipasvir cost $7000, $5500, $5500, and $875 per week, respectively, sofosbuvir-ledipasvir was cost-effective for genotype 1 and cost $12 825 more per OALY than usual care. For genotype 2, sofosbuvir-ribavirin and sofosbuvir-daclatasvir cost $110000 and $691 000 per QALY, respectively. For genotype 3, sofosbuvir-ledipasvir-ribavirin cost $73 000 per QALY, sofosbuvir-ribavirin was more costly and less effective than usual care, and sofosbuvir-daclatasvir cost more than $396 000 per QALY at assumed prices. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Sofosbuvir-ledipasvir was the optimal strategy in most simulations for genotype 1 and would be cost-saving if sofosbuvir cost less than $5500. For genotype 2, sofosbuvir-ribavirin-PEG would be cost-saving if sofosbuvir cost less than $2250 per week. For genotype 3, sofosbuvir-ledipasvir-ribavirin would be cost-saving if sofosbuvir cost less than $1500 per week. Limitation: Data are lacking on real-world effectiveness of new treatments and some prices. Conclusion: From a societal perspective, novel treatments for HCV are cost-effective compared with usual care for genotype 1 and probably genotype 3 but not for genotype 2.",2015,General & Internal Medicine
RNA-seq analysis of early enteromyxosis in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus): new insights into parasite invasion and immune evasion strategies,RNA-seq; Transcriptome; Turbot; Enteromyxum scophthalmi; Myxozoa; Pathogenesis; ACUTE-PHASE RESPONSE; INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL-CELLS; EXPERIMENTAL-INFECTION; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; ENTERIC PARASITE; NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM; ICTALURUS-PUNCTATUS; LEISHMANIA-DONOVANI; EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; CHANNEL CATFISH,"Enteromyxum scophthalmi, an intestinal myxozoan parasite, is the causative agent of a threatening disease for turbot (Scophthalmus maximus, L.) aquaculture. The colonisation of the digestive tract by this parasite leads to a cachectic syndrome associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This myxosporidiosis has a long pre-patent period and the first detectable clinical and histopathological changes are subtle. The pathogenic mechanisms acting in the early stages of infection are still far from being fully understood. Further information on the host-parasite interaction is needed to assist in finding efficient preventive and therapeutic measures. Here, a RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis of head kidney, spleen and pyloric caeca from experimentally-infected and control turbot was performed. Only infected fish with early signs of infection, determined by histopathology and immunohistochemical detection of E. scophthalmi, were selected. The RNA-seq analysis revealed, as expected, less intense transcriptomic changes than those previously found during later stages of the disease. Several genes involved in IFN-related pathways were up-regulated in the three organs, suggesting that the IFN-mediated immune response plays a main role in this phase of the disease. Interestingly, an opposite expression pattern had been found in a previous study on severely infected turbot. In addition, possible strategies for immune system evasion were suggested by the down-regulation of different genes encoding complement components and acute phase proteins. At the site of infection (pyloric caeca), modulation of genes related to different structural proteins was detected and the expression profile indicated the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation. These transcriptomic changes provide indications regarding the mechanisms of parasite attachment to and invasion of the host. The current results contribute to a better knowledge of the events that characterise the early stages of turbot enteromyxosis and provide valuable information to identify molecular markers for early detection and control of this important parasitosis.

"A Comparative Study of Orbital Blow Out Fracture Repair, Using Autogenous Bone Graft and Alloplastic Materials",Orbital floor; Orbital fracture; Bone graft; Iliac crest; Mandibular outer table; Silastic block; Titanium mesh; ,"Maxillofacial trauma, a common injury in urban population following road traffic accident or act of interpersonal violence of which orbital floor fractures is common. It impairs the integrity of the extraocular muscles and may be accompanied by enophthalmos, orbital deformity and diplopia. Orbital reconstruction is essential to improve anatomical and visual deformity. Repair of orbital floor is done by autologous bone graft or synthetic implants. Compare outcome of orbital floor reconstruction in blow out orbital fracture using autogenous bone graft from iliac crest, outer table of mandible, alloplastic implant-silastic block and titanium mesh. 30 patients having orbital fractures were considered in study population. All the patients were treated by ORIF and repair of floor by subcilliary incision. Out of 30 patients, repair of orbital floor was done by autologous bone graft from iliac crest in 7 patients (Group A), bone graft from outer table of mandible in 5 patients (Group B), implant using silastic block in 8 patients (Group C) and titanium mesh in 10 patients (Group D). Factors analyzed were age, sex, cause of fracture and treatment outcome in terms of correction of pre operative diplopia and enophthalmos, rate of development of post operative infection, wound dehiscence and implant exposure. All patents were reviewed at 4 weeks and 12 weeks following operation. 71.42% of patients in Group A had early correction of diplopia and enophthalmos. This was 100% in rest of the groups. All patients had complete correction when assessed at 12 weeks post operatively. Post operative complication rate was 20% and 12.5% in Group B and C respectively. There were no complications in the rest of the groups within the follow up period. No statistically significant difference as to the chance of occurrence of complication could be found amongst the groups. Autologous bone graft has no immunological reaction but donor site morbidity. Silastic block may case immunological reaction, infection, poor drainage of orbital floor. But titanium mesh for orbital floor repair has excellent outcome and superior to other modality of treatment.",2019,Surgery
Proteomic signatures of serum albumin-bound proteins from stroke patients with and without endovascular closure of PFO are significantly different and suggest a novel mechanism for cholesterol efflux,Biomarker; Discovery; Stroke; Cerebrovascular disease; Ischemic stroke; Patent foramen ovale; PFO; Mass spectrometry; Proteomics; Albumin; HIGH-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; OPPORTUNITIES; DISCOVERY; PEPTIDES; INSIGHTS; DISEASE; PLASMA; CELLS; HEART,"Background: The anatomy of PFO suggests that it can allow thrombi and potentially harmful circulatory factors to travel directly from the venous to the arterial circulation - altering circulatory phenotype. Our previous publication using high-resolution LC-MS/MS to profile protein and peptide expression patterns in plasma showed that albumin was relatively increased in donor samples from PFO-related than other types of ischemic strokes. Since albumin binds a host of molecules and acts as a carrier for lipoproteins, small molecules and drugs, we decided to investigate the albumin-bound proteins (in a similar sample cohort) in an effort to unravel biological changes and potentially discover biomarkers related to PFO-related stroke and PFO endovascular closure. Methods: The method used in this study combined albumin immuno-enrichment with high resolution LC-MS in order to specifically capture and quantify the albumin-bound proteins. Subsequently, we measured cholesterol and HDL in a larger, separate cohort of PFO stroke patients, pre and post closure. Results: The results demonstrated that a number of proteins were specifically associated with albumin in samples with and without endovascular closure of the PFO, and that the protein profiles were very different. Eight proteins, typically associated with HDL were common to both sample sets and quantitatively differently abundant. Pathway analysis of the MS results suggested that enhanced cholesterol efflux and reduced lipid oxidation were associated with PFO closure. Measurement of total cholesterol and HDL in a larger cohort of PFO closure samples using a colorimetric assay was consistent with the proteomic predictions. Conclusions: The collective data presented in this study demonstrate that analysis of albumin-bound proteins could provide a valuable tool for biomarker discovery on the effects of PFO endovascular closure. In addition, the results suggest that PFO endovascular closure can potentially have effects on HDL, cholesterol and albumin-bound ApoA-I abundance, therefore possibly providing benefits in cardioprotective functions.",2015,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
Bibliometric study of research and development for neglected diseases in the BRICS,Neglected diseases; Research and development; BRICS; Bibliometric analysis; TROPICAL DISEASES; TUBERCULOSIS,"Background: Large numbers of people are suffering from a group of diseases that mainly affect developing countries, as there are no available or affordable products for prevention or treatment. Research and development (R&D) for these diseases is still a low priority on the health agenda. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) are quickly growing economies and having more and more positive impact on global health. Additionally, their R&D capacity is believed to be enhanced through decades of investment in education and life science research. The BRICS, as a group of emerging and developing countries, are expected to make greater contributions to solving the problem that mainly affects the entire developing countries community. However, there has been little research to provide a macroscopic overview of BRICS' effort in R&D for neglected diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate scientific production in BRICS countries in this area and their main research hotspots. Methods: Global relevant literature was searched without time limits through PubMed and high yield countries were identified using GoPubMed. Literature up to the end of 2013 from the BRICS was obtained and high frequency words were extracted and clustered using Bibliography Item Co-occurrence Mining System 2.0 (BICOMS) and Graphical Clustering Toolkit 1.0 (gCLUTO). Results: In total, 32, 47, 51, 31 and 44 high frequency words from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa respectively were extracted for clustering analysis. The clustering indicated that eight diseases were research hotspots in BRICS countries. India had the most extensive hotspots and Brazil came in second. The other three countries shared common research foci: helminthiasis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis. Conclusions: Developed countries still make the majority of contributions to R&D on neglected diseases, but BRICS countries are playing a growing role. Instead of the big three diseases (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) recognized by WHO, the BRICS focus more on major causes of disease burden in their own countries. Disease burden and domestic policy, especially patent law, exert primary influence on the research focus.",2016,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine
Protecting the Rights of Farmers and Communities While Securing Long Term Market Access for Producers of Non-timber Forest Products: Experience in Southern Africa,; ,"The participatory domestication of agroforestry trees as an incentive to alleviate poverty, malnutrition, hunger and land degradation has to be linked to the commercialization of the products in ways that ensure that the farmers are the beneficiaries of their germplasm improvement activities, as well as from the marketing of the products. Currently, international law is deficient in providing adequate protection of the rights of poor farmers and their communities, as the legal instruments of Intellectual Property legislation are focused more on the protection of commercial companies and entrepreneurs. PhytoTrade Africa is engaged in addressing the sustainable use and commercialization of natural products produced by indigenous plants, especially trees of the Miombo woodlands in southern Africa. Initially the market focus has been on wild-harvested naturally occurring resources using innovative approaches to protecting the Intellectual Property Rights of poor communities and the businesses they work with, including Patents, Trademarks, and Geographical Indicators, with the intention of securing long-term strategic market access and to be able to influence commercial strategy. The approach which has been developed is to work with indigenous communities and local companies and to help them to secure long-term access to these markets through the protection of their intellectual property rights. Experience to date indicates that, by enabling market opportunities for these local resources, significant livelihood options for otherwise marginalized farmers and producers can be facilitated. Partnerships between producers and the local-to-global cosmetic, food, beverage, herbal medicine and pharmaceutical industries are developed by carefully constructing commercial agreements with leaders in the relevant sector. Critically this involves the establishment of a strong and viable trade association that is forward thinking and market oriented. Through these partnerships it is possible to ensure long-term relationships and supply agreements. Such agreements ensure that the target producers remain in the value chain. This paper also explores opportunities for protecting farmer-improved germplasm through the registration of Plant Breeders Rights in compliance with the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) and proposals for an affiliated African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI).",2017,Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry
The Potential Impact of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) on public health,trade and health; health policy; European Union; United States; LIBERALIZATION; POLICY; TIME,"This article aims to examine the potential health effects of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment partnership (TTIP). Our review indicates that, although proponents of the TTIP claim that the treaty will produce benefits to health-enhancing determinants such as economic growth and employment, evidence shows that previous trade liberalization policies are associated with increasing economic inequities. By reducing Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and by promoting increased cooperation between US and EU governmental agencies in the pharmaceutical sector, the TTIP could result in improved research cooperation and reduced duplication of processes. However, the TTIP chapter on Intellectual Property (IP) and Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) that expand and extend patent monopolies, and delay the availability of generic drugs, are likely to cause underutilization of needed medications among vulnerable populations. The TTIP's Investor to State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) arbitration system, a mechanism that allows transnational companies (TNCs) to sue governments when a policy or law reduces the value of their investment, is likely to generate a negative impact on regulations aimed at increasing access to healthcare, and reducing tobacco, alcohol consumption, and diet-related diseases. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS) of the TTIP is expected to weaken regulations in the food and agricultural sectors especially in the EU, with potentially negative effects on food safety and foodborne diseases. Finally, the ISDS is likely to infringe the ability of governments to tackle environmental problems such as climate change deemed to be the most important global health threat of the century. Our review concludes by discussing policy implications and the effect of the TTIP on democracy, national sovereignty and the balance of power between large TNCs and governments. It also discusses the adoption of an evidence-based precautionary principle approach in dealing with the health impact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) as well as the harmonization of regulations, norms, and standards toward stronger health and environmental protection.",2016,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

A method to extract Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) from airborne particulate matter was developed using a novel technology recently patented called ultrasound assisted extraction micro-scale cell (UAE-MSC). This technology extracts, filters, collects the sample, and evaporates the solvent, on-line. No sample transfer is needed.The cell minimizes sample manipulation, solvent consumption, waste generation, time, and energy; fulfilling most of the analytical green chemistry protocol. The methodology was optimized applying a centred 2(3) factorial experimental design. Optimum conditions were used to validate and determine concentration of 16 organochlorine pesticides (OCIs) and 6 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The best conditions achieved were 2 extractions with 5 mL (each) of dichloromethane over 5 min (each) at 60 degrees C and 80% ultrasound potency. POPs were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in negative chemical ionization (GC/MS-NCI). Analytical method validation was carried out on airborne particles spiked with POPs at seven concentration levels between 0.5 and 26.9 pg m(-3). This procedure was done by triplicate (N = 21). Recovery, ranged between 65.5 +/- 2.3% and 107.5 +/- 3.0% for OCIs and between 79.1 +/- 6.5% and 105.2 +/- 3.8% for PBDEs. Linearity (r(2)) was >= 0.94 for all compounds. Method detection limits, ranged from 0.5 to 2.7 pg m(-3), while limits of quantification (LOQ), ranged from 1.7 to 9.0 pg m(-3). A Bias from -18.6% to 9% for PBDEs was observed in the Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2787. SRM 2787 did not contain OCIs. OCIs recoveries were equivalent by UAE-MSC and Soxhlet methods UAE-MSC optimized extraction conditions reduced 30 times less solvent and decreased the extraction time from several hours to ten minutes, respect to Soxhlet. UAE-MSC was applied to 15 samples of particles less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) from three seasons (warm dry, rainy, and cold dry) collected in five sites around Mexico City.

Research on the Impact of Financial Ecological Environment on SME Financing,SMEs; financing; financial ecology; ,"With the progress of society and the rapid development of the economy, China's economy has undergone qualitative changes: the business mode has changed from the previous one that solely relied on the state-owned or collective enterprises to that dominated by small and medium-sized private enterprises. Nowadays, SMEs have become an indispensable part of China's economy: and they are the largest and most innovative organization group in China. Small and medium-sized enterprises not only promote the steady development of China's economy, but also provide more than 50% of the tax revenue for China's economic income and create more than 60% of the GDP; At the same time, it has made tremendous contributions to improving people's livelihood, relieving employment pressure, and promoting technological innovation. According to statistics, small and medium-sized enterprises accounts for 99% of the total enterprises in China, providing more than 80% of urban employment jobs in China, and completing more than 70% of patent inventions. However, as China is still in the transitional stage of economic development and its financial environment is still not perfect, which has led to the stagnation of SMEs in financing difficulties. In addition, with the impact of the international financial crisis, the international and domestic financial markets and their financial environment are in an unstable state, which has greatly affected the development of China's SMEs and made it more difficult to attract financing. This paper will take the financing difficulties of SMEs as the starting point. By combining the theory and case analysis, this paper analyzes and studies the meaning of the internal meaning behind the financial environment data and analyzes the influence of the financial environment on SMEs from five aspects. Finally, based on the results of theory and case analysis, this paper proposes to improve the financial ecological environment to accelerate the improvement of laws and regulations on financial support for SMEs in the financial environment, thereby promoting the healthy development of financial markets. In the end, the optimization of financial ecology will alleviate the big problem of financing difficulties faced by SMEs.",2019,Environmental Sciences & Ecology

Adult C57BL/J6 mice (n = 40) were assigned to treatment groups: control, ischemia PBS, ischemia PVAX, ischemia NPY3-36, and Ischemia PVAX-NPY3-36. Ischemia was induced by ligation of the femoral artery in all groups except control and given relevant treatments (PBS, PVAX, NPY3-36, and PVAX-NPY3-36). Blood flow was quantified using laser Doppler imaging. On days 3 and 14 posttreatment, mice were euthanized to harvest gastrocnemius muscle for immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Blood flow was significantly improved in the PVAX-NPY3-36 group after 14 days. Western blot showed an increase in angiogenic factors VEGF-R2 and PDGF-beta (P = 0.0035 and P = 0.031, respectively) and antiapoptotic marker Bcl-2 in the PVAX-NPY3-(36) group compared with ischemia PBS group (P = 0.023). Proapoptotic marker Smad5 was significantly decreased in the PVAX-NPY3-36 group as compared with the ischemia PBS group (P = 0.028). Furthermore, Y-2 receptors were visualized in endothelial cells of newly formed arteries in the PVAX-NPY3-36 group. In conclusion, we were able to show that PVAX-NPY3-36 can induce angiogenesis and arteriogenesis as well as improve functional blood flow in a murine model of hind limb ischemia. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our research project proposes a novel method for drug delivery. Our patented PVAX nanoparticle can detect areas of ischemia and oxidative stress. Although there have been studies about delivering angiogenic molecules to areas of ischemic injury, there are drawbacks of nonspecific delivery as well as short half-lives. Our study is unique because it can specifically deliver NPY3-36 to ischemic tissue and appears to extend the amount of time therapy is available, despite NPY3-36's short half-life.",2017,Physiology; Sport Sciences
Elimination Communication: Diaper-Free in America,; CHILDREN,"When we were planning to have our third child, we made a conscious decision to not use disposable diapers. We felt sheepish that we had already contributed 2 children's worth of diapers to our nation's landfills. Unfortunately, washing and drying cloth diapers could triple the amount of work for us. Further, exchanging disposable diapers for energy-and water-consuming laundering was not an environmentally guilt-free option. How did we as humans take care of children before disposable diapers? Researching this question, we soon learned about elimination communication (EC). EC, also known as natural infant hygiene, is the practice of using the infant's natural timing and cues to recognize when they need to defecate or urinate. By identifying these cues, caregivers can coordinate elimination in the toilet rather than in a diaper. Contrary to the notion that infants relieve themselves randomly and constantly throughout the day, infants naturally eliminate at predictable times, such as on waking or after feeding. Caregivers can incorporate audio cues (soft whistle or hum) to associate with the act of eliminating. With practice, many children learn to eliminate when they are in proper position and hear the cue. EC is not a new concept. Humans have been doing this for millennia and still do in most resource-limited regions. As little as 3 to 4 generations ago, most Americans did as well. So, why has the pendulum in mainstream American culture swung so far away from EC? The disposable diaper was first patented in 1955.(1)-In 1962, pediatric developmental specialist Dr T. Berry Brazelton published a seminal paper outlining why parents should avoid pushing their child prematurely to toilet training.(2) He based his recommendations on the physical and psychological developmental milestones required for children to consciously become toilet trained. He demonstrated that most children are ready by the age of 2 to 3 years. Pediatricians have embraced this child-driven approach and helped countless families use Brazelton techniques for toilet training.(3) By the 1980s, most US children were using disposable diapers. As family lives become busier, the convenience of disposable diapers has become a virtual necessity. Now, there are an estimated 27.4 billion disposable diapers used in the United States each year.(4)",2017,Pediatrics
"Access to medicines and hepatitis C in Africa: can tiered pricing and voluntary licencing assure universal access, health equity and fairness?",Hepatitis C; Access to medicine; Tiered pricing; Voluntary licensing; Universal access; Health equity; Africa; ,"Background: The recent introduction of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) for treating Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) can significantly assist in the world reaching the international target of elimination by 2030. Yet, the challenge facing many individuals and countries today lies with their ability to access these treatments due to their relatively high prices. Gilead Sciences applies differential pricing and licensing strategies arguing that this provides fairer and more equitable access to these life-saving medicines. This paper analyses the implications of Gilead's tiered pricing and voluntary licencing strategy for access to the DAAs. Methods: We examined seven countries in Africa (Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Rwanda and South Africa) to assess their financial capacity to provide DAAs for the treatment of HCV under present voluntary licensing and tiered-pricing arrangements. These countries have been selected to explore the experience of countries with a range of different burdens of HCV and shared eligibility for supply by licensed generic producers or from discounted Gilead prices. Results: The cost of 12-weeks of generic DAA varies from $684 per patient treated in Egypt to $750 per patient treated in other countries. These countries can also procure the same DAA for 12-weeks of treatment from the originator, Gilead, at a cost of $1200 per patient. The current prices of DAAs (both from generic and originator manufacturers) are much more than the median annual income per capita and the annual health budget of most of these countries. If governments alone were to bear the costs of universal treatment coverage, then the required additional health expenditure from present rates would range from a 4% increase in South Africa to a staggering 403% in Cameroon. Conclusion: The current arrangements for increasing access to DAAs, towards elimination of HCV, are facing challenges that would require increases in expenditure that are either too burdensome to governments or potentially so to individuals and families. Countries need to implement the flexibilities in the Doha Declaration on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights agreement, including compulsory licensing and patent opposition. This also requires political commitment, financial will, global solidarity and civil society activism.",2017,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
Static Metabolic Bubbles as Precursors of Vascular Gas Emboli During Divers' Decompression: A Hypothesis Explaining Bubbling Variability,diving; decompression sickness; desaturation; oxygen window; pre-conditioning; CIRCULATING VENOUS BUBBLES; MAXIMAL OXYGEN-UPTAKE; PATENT FORAMEN OVALE; LARGE BLOOD-VESSELS; NEUTROPHIL ACTIVATION; ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; DARK CHOCOLATE; LUMINAL ASPECT; SICKNESS; EXERCISE,"Introduction: The risk for decompression sickness (DCS) after hyperbaric exposures (such as SCUBA diving) has been linked to the presence and quantity of vascular gas emboli (VGE) after surfacing from the dive. These VGE can be semi-quantified by ultrasound Doppler and quantified via precordial echocardiography. However, for an identical dive, VGE monitoring of divers shows variations related to individual susceptibility, and, for a same diver, dive-to-dive variations which may be influenced by pre-dive pre-conditioning. These variations are not explained by currently used algorithms. In this paper, we present a new hypothesis: individual metabolic processes, through the oxygen window (OW) or Inherent Unsaturation of tissues, modulate the presence and volume of static metabolic bubbles (SMB) that in turn act as precursors of circulating VGE after a dive. Methods: We derive a coherent system of assumptions to describe static gas bubbles, located on the vessel endothelium at hydrophobic sites, that would be activated during decompression and become the source of VGE. We first refer to the OW and show that it creates a local tissue unsaturation that can generate and stabilize static gas phases in the diver at the surface. We then use Non-extensive thermodynamics to derive an equilibrium equation that avoids any geometrical description. The final equation links the SMB volume directly to the metabolism. Results and Discussion: Our model introduces a stable population of small gas pockets of an intermediate size between the nanobubbles nucleating on the active sites and the VGE detected in the venous blood. The resulting equation, when checked against our own previously published data and the relevant scientific literature, supports both individual variation and the induced differences observed in pre-conditioning experiments. It also explains the variability in VGE counts based on age, fitness, type and frequency of physical activities. Finally, it fits into the general scheme of the arterial bubble assumption for the description of the DCS risk. Conclusion: Metabolism characterization of the pre-dive SMB population opens new possibilities for decompression algorithms by considering the diver's individual susceptibility and recent history (life style, exercise) to predict the level of VGE during and after decompression.",2019,Physiology
"Social group and health care provider interventions to increase the demand for malaria rapid diagnostic test among community members in Ebonyi state, Nigeria: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial",MRDT; Fever; Malaria; Demand; Social groups; Providers; Community members; ,"Background: The World Health Organization recommended (in 2010) universal testing for suspected malaria, due to some fundamental changes in malaria trends such as the declining incidence of malaria in high-burden countries, the emergence of parasite resistance to anti-malarial drugs especially artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and the increased availability of diagnostic testing such as the malaria rapid diagnostic test (MRDT). The Nigerian government has long adopted this recommendation and with the support of foreign partners has scaled up the availability of MRDT. However, the malaria/MRDT rate in the communities is still far short of the recommendation. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of social group and social group/provider interventions in increasing the demand (use and/or request) for MRDT among community members with fever or malaria-like illness in Ebonyi state, Nigeria. Methods: A three-arm, parallel, stratified cluster randomized design will be used to evaluate the effect of two interventions compared to control: control involves the usual practice of provision of MRDT services by public primary healthcare providers and patent medicine vendors; social group intervention involves the sensitization/education of social groups about MRDT; social group/provider intervention involves social group treatment plus the training of healthcare providers in health communication about MRDT with clients. The primary outcome is the proportion of children under 5 years of age with fever/malaria-like illness, in the 2 weeks preceding a household survey, who received MRDT. The co-primary outcome is the proportion of children ages 5 years and above and adults (excluding pregnant women) with fever/malaria-like illness, in the 2 weeks preceding a household survey, who received MRDT. The primary outcome will be assessed through household surveys at baseline and at the end of the study. Discussion: The pragmatic and behavioural nature of the interventions delivered to groups of individuals and the need to minimize contamination informed the use of a cluster-randomized design in this study in investigating whether the social group and social group/provider interventions will increase the demand for MRDT among community members. Pragmatic means the interventions would occur in natural settings or real- life situations.",2019,Research & Experimental Medicine
Alpha-Gal Inactivated Heart Valve Bioprostheses Exhibit an Anti-Calcification Propensity Similar to Knockout Tissues,xenogeneic epitopes; calcification; oxidative injury; bioprosthetic heart valves; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; BOVINE PERICARDIUM; AORTIC-VALVE; WILD-TYPE; IN-VITRO; PORCINE; COLLAGEN; XENOTRANSPLANTATION; IMPLANTATION; LEAFLETS,"Background: Glutaraldehyde (GLA) has been used to crosslink bioprosthetic heart valve (BHVs) tissues to enhance their stability, besides ensuring a satisfactory degree of immunological tolerance. Unfortunately, GLA fixation does not guarantee a complete tissue biocompatibility of BHVs in currently used devices. The interaction between preformed human anti-alpha-Gal antibody and alpha-Gal antigens promotes the calcification of GLA-treated alpha-Gal-positive tissue. Recently, an alarming correlation between the presence of the alpha-Gal epitope and a premature BHVs degeneracy was reported. This article presents the results of a novel treatment called FACTA, for the inactivation of the alpha-Gal epitopes in porcine aortic valve tissue and commercial BHVs. Methods: Evaluation of the alpha-Gal epitope inactivation was performed through a patented ELISA test, confirmed by western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemical analyses. Investigations were also conducted to assess the in vitro propensity to trigger thrombosis, calcification, and worsening of FACTA-treated tissue. To explain the mechanism of action through which the FACTA treatment acts, a specific experimental model, based on the mass spectroscopy approach, was performed. Results: The study confirms that GLA is able to ensure the inactivation of approximately half alpha-Gal epitopes originally present in both porcine aortic valve tissue and marketed BHVs. By subjecting tissues to the FACTA procedure, it was possible to obtain an alpha-Gal inactivation degree of about 95% alongside to a reduced propensity from 72.6% to 85.4% to the in vitro calcification for porcine aortic valve tissue and 80.5% for commercial treated BHVs. FACTA was effective in decreasing oxidative tissue damage and protecting collagen from degradation. Finally, FACTA could further mitigate or even abrogate the need for early anticoagulation therapies after BHV implantation. Conclusion: A novel treatment, called FACTA, is effective to produce biological tissues that are less susceptible to enzymatic and oxidative stress and structural degradation, calcification, and thrombus formation. FACTA-treated tissues display a clear improvement of their biocompatibility that is characterized by an almost complete inactivation of the alpha-Gal epitope. FACTA prevents the xenogeneic tissue antigens from reacting with the host immune system, ensuring an effective shield effect that makes the tissue surface less reactive and more biocompatible.",2017,Cell Biology; Engineering; Materials Science
OF PROPERTY AND INFORMATION,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; TITLE SYSTEMS; LAND; COPYRIGHT; PATENT; LAW; REGISTRATION; RIGHTS; RULES,"The property information interface is perhaps the most crucial and undertheorized dimension of property law. Information about property can make or break property rights. Information about assets and property rights can dramatically enhance the value of ownership. Conversely, a dearth of information can significantly reduce the benefits associated with ownership. It is surprising, therefore, that contemporary property theorists do not engage in sustained analysis of the property information interface and, in particular, of registries the repositories of information about property. Once, things were different. In the past, discussions of registries used to be a core topic in property classes and a focal point for property scholarship. In recent decades, registries have lost their luster for scholars, and their discussion has been relegated to the innermost pages of property textbooks. The reason for this is that registries are widely considered the domain of legal practitioners, not of theorists. This Essay argues that nothing could be further from the truth. Registries and the information they contain are, in fact, the formative forces that shape the world of property and no theoretical account of the institution of property can be complete without them. In this Essay, we offer the first in-depth legal-theoretical analysis of the intricate relationship among title information, rights, and assets in the domain of property, as mediated by registries. Our analysis gives rise to several new insights. First, we highlight the triple role that registries perform for property owners. They simultaneously perform a facilitative role by streamlining transactions between willing sellers and buyers, an obstructive role by hindering non-consensual encroachments and takings of assets, and an enabling role by allowing owners to locate and use their own lost assets. Second, going against the accepted lore, we posit that perfect registries, even if they were possible, are socially undesirable on account of what we call the information-asset paradox. Perfect information about assets and legal rights may result in the destruction, dismembering, and mutilation of the asset by nonconsensual takers in an attempt to make the asset unrecognizable, as exemplified by millions of stolen cars and jewelry, or, conversely, in attempts of identity theft that confer thieves with the benefit of the registered rights. Third, we argue that the registries are socially desirable when it is impossible or difficult to alter the defining characteristic of the underlying asset. This insight explains why there are registries for nontransformable assets, such as land and unique art-works, but not for transformable assets that include mass production goods and many natural resources. Finally, we address the question of which rights should be covered by registries and how much legal deference should be given to them. The framework we provide is significant not only for theoretical reasons but also for practical ones. For example, it can inform policy makers in deciding whether to establish new registries for smartphones and personal computers in order to combat theft of such devices. Similarly, our analysis sounds a cautionary note about the ability of registries of copyrighted works to curb unlawful appropriation and distribution. Per our analysis, such assets are infinitely malleable and, worse yet, information concerning ownership in such works can be easily effaced or altered in the digital age. We also discuss how considerations of costs and privacy affect the comprehensiveness and integrity of registries. At the end of the day, our analysis exposes the promise and the limitations of registries, as well as the ways in which they can be improved by the state.",2016,Government & Law
Intravenous Air: The Partially Invisible Phenomenon,; PATENT FORAMEN OVALE; EMBOLISM; SOLUBILITY; WATER,"BACKGROUND: Air injection is carefully avoided during IV solution administration; however, ambient air is dissolved in all liquids used for intravenous (IV) therapy. A portion of this gas will come out of solution in the form of bubbles as the solution is warmed to body temperature in a fluid warming system and/or within the body. We sought to quantify the proportion of the gas theoretically dissolved in room temperature crystalloid and 4 degrees C blood products that comes out of solution in the IV tubing on warming to 37 degrees C. METHODS: Equilibrium-dissolved air calculations were performed for sodium chloride (0.9%), packed red blood cells, and fresh frozen plasma at various temperatures according to Henry's Law. Outgassed gas volumes were experimentally measured for room temperature sodium chloride (0.9%) and 4 degrees C blood products (packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma) warmed to 37 degrees C during infusion into a body temperature water bath. The measured gas volumes were quantified as a fraction of the theoretical outgassing volumes required to maintain equilibrium saturation. RESULTS: Measured outgassed volumes in the IV tubing in milliliters of gas per liter of fluid were 1.4 +/- 0.3 mL/L (n = 6) for sodium chloride (0.9%), 3.4 +/- 0.2 mL/L (n = 6) for packed red blood cells, and 4.8 +/- 0.8 mL/L (n = 6) for fresh frozen plasma when these fluids were warmed to body temperature from their respective starting temperatures. Theoretical outgassed gas volumes required to maintain equilibrium saturation for the same fluids and temperatures are 4.7 mL/L for sodium chloride (0.9%), 8.3 mL/L for packed red blood cells, and 10.9 mL/L for fresh frozen plasma. As a fraction of the theoretical outgassing volumes, the measured air volumes represented 30%, 41%, and 44%, respectively, for sodium chloride (0.9%), packed red blood cells, and fresh frozen plasma. Prewarming crystalloid solutions to 37 degrees C before administration significantly reduced the outgassing. CONCLUSIONS: A significant and potentially clinically relevant amount of the resident dissolved gas in room temperature crystalloid, and 4 degrees C packed red blood cells and plasma solutions comes out of solution on warming to body temperature. A nontrivial fraction of this outgassing is also expected to Occur within the body circulation based on the results of this study. This can be substantially prevented by prewarming.",2016,Anesthesiology
Coherent optical transients observed in rubidium atomic line filtered Doppler velocimetry experiments,; FOURIER-TRANSFORM RAMAN; SHOCK-WAVES; VELOCITY-MEASUREMENTS; GLOBAL VELOCIMETRY; ALKALI ATOMS; D-2 LINES; LASER; INTERFEROMETER; SPECTROSCOPY; ULTRAFAST,"We report the first successful results from our novel Rubidium Atomic Line Filtered (RALF) Doppler velocimetry apparatus, along with unanticipated oscillatory signals due to coherent optical transients generated within pure Rb vapor cells. RALF is a high-velocity and high-acceleration extension of the well-known Doppler Global Velocimetry (DGV) technique for constructing multidimensional flow velocity vector maps in aerodynamics experiments [H. Komine, U.S. Patent No. 4,919,536 (24 April 1990)]. RALF exploits the frequency dependence of pressure-broadened Rb atom optical absorptions in a heated Rb/N-2 gas cell to encode the Doppler shift of reflected nearresonant (lambda(0) approximate to 780.24 nm) laser light onto the intensity transmitted by the cell. The present RALF apparatus combines fiber optic and free-space components and was built to determine suitable operating conditions and performance parameters for the Rb/N-2 gas cells. It yields single-spot velocities of thin laser-driven-flyer test surfaces and incorporates a simultaneous Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) channel [Strand et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 77, 083108 (2006)] for validation of the RALF results, which we demonstrate here over the v = 0 to 1 km/s range. Both RALF and DGV presume the vapor cells to be simple Beer's Law optical absorbers, so we were quite surprised to observe oscillatory signals in experiments employing low pressure pure Rb vapor cells. We interpret these oscillations as interference between the Doppler shifted reflected light and the Free Induction Decay (FID) coherent optical transient produced within the pure Rb cells at the original laser frequency; this is confirmed by direct comparison of the PDV and FID signals. We attribute the different behaviors of the Rb/N-2 vs. Rb gas cells to efficient dephasing of the atomic/optical coherences by Rb-N-2 collisions. The minimum necessary N-2 buffer gas density approximate to 0.3 amagat translates into a smallest useful velocity range of 0 to 2 km/s, which can readily be extended to cover the 0 to 10 km/s range, and beyond. The recognition that coherent optical transients can be produced within low pressure vapor cells during velocimetry experiments may offer new insights into some quantitative discrepancies reported in earlier DGV studies. Future plans include line-RALF experiments with streak camera detection, and two-dimensional surface velocity mapping using pulsed laser illumination and/or gated intensified CCD camera detection.",2015,Physics
Heparin-gelatin mixture improves vascular reconstruction efficiency and hepatic function in bioengineered livers,Liver tissue engineering; Vascular reconstruction; Endothelialization; Decellularized livers; Transplantation; PRIMARY HUMAN HEPATOCYTES; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; PORCINE KIDNEYS; PLASMA-PROTEINS; HEPG2 CELLS; BINDING; DECELLULARIZATION; PREDICTIVITY; ANTITHROMBIN,"Whole organ decellularization is a cell removal process that creates a natural extracellular matrix for use in transplantation. A lack of an intact endothelial layer in the vascular network of decellularized organs results in blood clotting even with anti-coagulation treatment. Furthermore, shear stress caused by blood flow may affect reseeded parenchymal cells. We hypothesized that a heparin-gelatin mixture (HG) can act as an antithrombotic coating reagent and induce attachment and migration of endothelial cells (ECs) on vascular wall surfaces within decellularized livers, with subsequent parenchymal cell function enhancement. Portal vein (PV) perfusion was performed for right lateral lobe decellularization of porcine livers. We tested if HG-precoating of isolated decellularized PV could increase EC attachment and migration. Additionally, we coated PV and hepatic artery walls in decellularized liver with HG, and then repopulated it with ECs and maintained it under vascular flow in a bioreactor for 10 days. Re-endothelialized scaffolds were perfused with porcine blood for thrombogenicity evaluation. We then co-cultured hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells and ECs to evaluate the effect of endothelialization on parenchymal cells. Finally, we transplanted these scaffolds heterotopically in pigs. HG improved ECs' ability to migrate and adhere to vessel discs. ECs efficiently covered the vascular compartments within decellularized scaffolds and maintained function and proliferation after HG-precoating. No thrombosis was observed after 24 h blood perfusion in HG-precoated scaffolds, indicating an efficiently endothelialized vascular tree. HepG2 cells displayed a higher function in scaffolds endothelialized after HG-precoating compared to uncoated scaffolds in vitro and after in vivo transplantation. Our results lay the groundwork for engineering human-sized whole-liver scaffolds for clinical applications. Statement of Significance A major obstacle to successful organ bioengineering is vasculature reconstruction to avoid thrombosis and deliver nutrients through blood to the whole scaffold after in vivo transplantation. Although many attempts have been made to construct endothelial cell layers on the vascular network within decellularized organs, complete coverage has not be achieved. Here, we describe an effective approach for endothelial cell seeding to reconstruct a patent vascular tree within decellularized livers by coating the vasculature using heparin-gelatin mixture. Our results have demonstrate that enhancement of endothelial cell attachment by heparin-gelatin treatment could improve vascular patency and parenchymal cell function in vitro and in vivo. These results represent a significant advancement toward bioengineering functional liver tissue that maintains vascular patency for transplantation. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

AD-1 has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation without significant host toxicity in vivo, and has excellent development potential as a new anti-cancer agent. This study was designed systematically to explore the metabolic pathway of ginseng sapogenins. The metabolism of drugs in the body is a complex biotransformation process where drugs are structurally modified to different molecules (metabolites) through various metabolizing enzymes. The compounds responsible for the effects of orally administered ginseng are believed to be metabolites produced in the gastrointestinal tract, so understanding the metabolism of the drug candidate can help to optimize its pharmacokinetics. In this study, faeces samples were collected and extracted after oral administration of AD-1. The 16 metabolites of AD-1 were isolated and identified for the first time with various chromatographic techniques, including semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry; of these 16 metabolites, 10 were novel compounds. We first discovered the biotransformation of dammarane-type sapogenins into oleanane-type sapogenins in rats and found a series of metabolites that changed, mainly at C-25 and C-29. This study provides new ideas for the metabolic pathway of ginseng sapogenins. The isolated compounds were screened for their effect on the viability and proliferation against cancer cell lines (Human A549, MCF-7, HELA, HO-8901 and U87). The discovery of novel active metabolites 3 beta, 12 beta, 21 alpha, 22 beta-Hydroxy-24-norolean-12-ene (M6) may lead to a new or improved drug candidate. For one, M6 could inhibit the growth of all the tested cancer cells. Among the tested cell lines, M6 exhibited the most remarkable inhibitory effect on ovarian cancer HO-8901 cells, with IC50 value of 2.086 mu M. On this basis, we studied the anticancer mechanisms of M6. The results indicated that the pro-apoptotic feature of M6 acts via a mitochondrial pathway. Our results indicated that M6 exhibited a higher inhibitory effect on cancer-cell proliferation than AD-1 by inducing cell apoptosis. Our work provides data for future investigations on the metabolic mechanism of AD-1 in vivo and the potential for future research on developing a new drug.",2019,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry
The Impact of Integrated Community Case Management of Childhood Diseases Interventions to Prevent Malaria Fever in Children Less than Five Years Old in Bauchi State of Nigeria,; INSECTICIDE-TREATED NETS; BED NETS; COUNTRIES,"Background Malaria accounts for about 300,000 childhood deaths and 30% of under-five year old mortality in Nigeria annually. We assessed the impact of intervention strategies that integrated Patent Medicines Vendors into community case management of childhood-diseases, improved access to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) and distributed bed nets to households. We explored the influence of household socioeconomic characteristics on the impact of the interventions on fever in the under-five year olds in Bauchi State Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional case-controlled, interventional study, which sampled 3077 and 2737 under-5 year olds from 1,588 and 1601 households in pre- and post-intervention periods respectively, was conducted from 2013 to 2015. Difference-in-differences and logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the impact attributable to the interventions: integrated community case management of childhood illness which introduced trained public and private sector health providers and the possession of nets on the prevalence of fever. Results Two-week prevalence of fever among under-fives declined from 56.6% at pre-intervention to 42.5% at post-intervention. Fever-prevention fraction attributable to nets was statistically significant (OR = 0.217, 95% CI: 0.08-0.33). Children in the intervention group had significantly fewer incidence of fever than children in the control group had (OR = 0.765, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87). Although being in the intervention group significantly provided 23.5% protection against fever (95% CI: 0.13-0.33), the post-intervention likelihood of fever was also significantly less than at pre-intervention (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.50-0.65). The intervention protection fraction against fever was statistically significant at 43.4%(OR = 0.434, 95% CI: 0.36-0.50). Logistic regression showed that the odds of fever were lower in households with nets (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.88), among children whose mothers had higher education, in the post-intervention period (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.33-0.46) and in the intervention group (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.48-0.66). The odds of fever increased with higher socio-economic status of households (17.9%-19.5%). Difference-in-differences showed that the interventions significantly reduced occurrence of fever in the intervention group (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.36-2.14). Conclusion The interventions were effective in reducing the prevalence and the likelihood of childhood malaria fever. Taken to scale, these can significantly reduce the burden of malaria fever in the under-five year old children.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics
DEBATE ON THE US TAX REFORM AND THE EU ATAD The Proposal for a Global Minimum Tax: Comeback of Residence Taxation in the Digital Era?: Comment on Can GILTI,; ,"While the political and academic debate on how to address the tax challenges raised by the digitalized economy has been revolving predominantly around extending the right to tax of the source/market state, the most recent proposal -a global minimum tax -chooses a very different path. The idea of a global minimum tax system is to ensure a certain minimum level of taxation through strengthened CFC-and anti-base erosion rules; the underlying policy agenda being that zero or overall low taxation should not only be mitigated by granting more taxing rights to source/market states but by strengthening the residual taxing right of resident states. So far, technical details on how such a system should look like are still missing. Behind this background, the question has been raised in literature whether the US GILTI-and BEAT-rules, introduced in the course of the 2017 US tax reform, could serve as a blueprint for global reform. Taking both GILTI and BEAT as a starting point, this paper tries to develop a tentative tax policy decision tree highlighting crucial conceptual, technical and political issues legislators will have to find solutions for, when implementing such a global minimum tax regime. In doing so, the paper claims that a specific (BEAT-like) outbound regime supplementing the regime's inbound prong (i.e. GILTI-like rules) might be obsolete insofar as both overlap. An unaligned and parallel application of both, inbound and outbound elements, inherently leads to double taxation. From a policy perspective the implementation of a global minimum tax system along the lines of GILTI and BEAT would have two noteworthy side effects: not only would it mean a significant shift to the credit method and hence capital export neutrality, but would - as the name' minimum tax system' indicates - also potentially mean the end of preferential regime for income from intangibles, e.g. patent boxes; a somewhat ironic effect considering that the third major change to the US international tax rules put into place in 2017, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) rules introduced exactly such a preferential system. Moreover, the inherently unilateral nature of the rules such a global minimum tax system would be based upon (i.e. CFC-and anti-base erosion rules) would arguably decrease the relevance of tax treaties and lead to the problem that the existing treaty based mechanism for dispute resolution might become ineffective. Last but not least, implementing a minimum tax regime would require diligent manoeuvering around significant EU law concerns.",2019,Government & Law

To meaningfully evaluate policy options, it is important to analyze historical context and understand why similar initiatives failed previously. ContextRising drug prices are putting pressure on health care budgets. Policymakers are assessing how they can save money through generic drugs. MethodsWe compared generic drug prices and market shares in 13 European countries, using data from 2013, to assess the amount of variation that exists between countries. To place these results in context, we reviewed evidence from recent studies on the prices and use of generics in Europe and the United States. We also surveyed peer-reviewed studies, gray literature, and books published since 2000 to (1) outline existing generic drug policies in European countries and the United States; (2) identify ways to increase generic drug use and to promote price competition among generic drug companies; and (3) explore barriers to implementing reform of generic drug policies, using a historical example from the United States as a case study. FindingsThe prices and market shares of generics vary widely across Europe. For example, prices charged by manufacturers in Switzerland are, on average, more than 2.5 times those in Germany and more than 6 times those in the United Kingdom, based on the results of a commonly used price index. The proportion of prescriptions filled with generics ranges from 17% in Switzerland to 83% in the United Kingdom. By comparison, the United States has historically had low generic drug prices and high rates of generic drug use (84% in 2013), but has in recent years experienced sharp price increases for some off-patent products. There are policy solutions to address issues in Europe and the United States, such as streamlining the generic drug approval process and requiring generic prescribing and substitution where such policies are not yet in place. The history of substitution laws in the United States provides insights into the economic, political, and cultural issues influencing the adoption of generic drug policies. ConclusionsGovernments should apply coherent supply- and demand-side policies in generic drug markets. An immediate priority is to convince more physicians, pharmacists, and patients that generic drugs are bioequivalent to branded products. Special-interest groups continue to obstruct reform in Europe and the United States.",2017,Health Care Sciences & Services
ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ASPECTS AGAINST CONTROLLING GOODS TURNOVER,counterfeit goods; illicit trafficking; infringement of intellectual property rights; copyright holder; consumer; forgery; SHADOW ECONOMY,"The purpose of this article is to describe the content of the economic and legal bases of counteraction to the circulation of counterfeit goods. Using systemic and formal-logical methods, the amount of economic losses is outlined and the magnitudes of consequences arising from the circulation of counterfeit goods for the state, patent holders, consumers and manufacturers of counterfeits are outlined. It has been stated that drugs, toys, agrochemicals, and foodstuffs are the most counterfeit at the moment and are not only supported by crime as a crime in the field of intellectual property, but also endanger the lives and healths. Considering the market of counterfeit goods described its features, which are that the operation indicated the author but due to factors such as low solvency of the population in developing countries; the inability to sell counterfeit products separately from the original products, due to the fact that the original products are used for masking in the sale of counterfeiting; lack of specialized equipment for establishing counterfeit goods and knowledge of the original; scale and narrow specialization of counterfeit goods market participants; the transnational nature of this market; splicing organized crime with law enforcement agencies; high profitability of counterfeit market. The practical importance of the research is the documentary analysis examines the international legal aspects of counterfeiting of such goods and notes that the rules of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS and the EU Customs Regulation on Intellectual Property Observance set out measures to combat trafficking in goods that infringes intellectual property rights. Consequently, successfully tackling counterfeit goods trafficking requires a constant search for innovative methods of struggle. An effective strategy for overcoming this phenomenon should combine the various measures of its counteraction, all of them should be used in a coordinated and systematic way, complementing each other. Therefore, both economic and political management methods must be taken into account to overcome the counterfeit. And only their optimal combination will have the greatest effect in the formation of concepts of counteraction to the circulation of counterfeit goods. And this is definitely worth the effort since the innovative and economic development of the state depends on solving the problem of creating an effective system of protection of intellectual property rights. Methodology. A methodological framework of the economic and legal bases of counteraction to the circulation of counterfeit goods is defined by the complex of scientific cognition methods that allow us to look at this problem as a multi-aspect, interdisciplinary phenomenon. On the basis of the system, structural, systemic-functional and other scientific approaches, the idea of counteraction to the circulation of counterfeit goods has formed a complex systemic category covering the theoretical and practical level of economic and legal activity.",2019,Business & Economics

Design: Prospective multicenter observational study. Setting: Medical/surgical PICUs of seven Spanish University Medical Centers. Patients: Seventy-five pediatric patients (42 male, 33 female), median age 36 months (range, 1-207 mo), were divided into three groups: normal cardiovascular status, cardiovascular dysfunction, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Interventions: All patients received hemodynamic monitoring with PiCCO(2) (Pulsion Medical System SE, Munich, Germany). We evaluated 598 transpulmonary thermodilution sets of measurements. In 40 patients, stroke volume index, cardiac index, and global end-diastolic volume index were measured before and after 66 fluid challenges and loadings to test fluid responsiveness at different preload levels. Measurements and Main Results: Global end-diastolic volume versus predicted body surface area exhibits a power-law relationship: Global end-diastolic volume index (= 488.8.predicted body surface area(0.388) (r(2) = 0.93). Four levels of cardiac preload were established from the resulting normal global end-diastolic volume index (= 488.8.predicted body surface area(0.388)). Stroke volume index and cardiac index versus global end-diastolic volume index/normal global end-diastolic volume index built using a linear mixed model analysis emulated Frank-Starling curves: in cardiovascular dysfunction group, stroke volume index (geometric mean [95% CI]) was 27 mL/m(2) (24-31 mL/m(2)) at <= 0.67 times normal global end-diastolic volume index, 37 mL/m(2) (35-40 mL/m(2)) at > 0.67 <= 1.33 times normal global end-diastolic volume index (Delta stroke volume index = 35%; p < 0.0001; area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 75%), 45 mL/ m(2) (41-49 mL/m(2)) at > 1.33 <= 1.51 times normal global end-diastolic volume index (Delta stroke volume index = 21%; p < 0.0001; area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 73%), and 47 mL/m(2) (43-51 mL/m(2)) at > 1.51 times normal global end-diastolic volume index (Delta stroke volume index = 4%; p = 1; area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 54%). In dilated cardiomyopathy group, stroke volume index was 21 mL/m(2) (17-26 mL/m(2)) at > 0.67 <= 1.33 times normal global end-diastolic volume index, 27 mL/m(2) (21-34 mL/ m(2)) at > 1.33 <= 1.51 times normal global end-diastolic volume index (Delta stroke volume index = 29%; p = 0.005; area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 64%), and 25 mL/m(2) (20-32 mL/m(2)) at > 1.51 times normal global end-diastolic volume index (Delta stroke volume index = -8%; p = 1; area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 54%). Conclusions: This study provides normal values for global end-diastolic volume index and limits of cardiac preload responsiveness in pediatric patients with cardiovascular dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy; 1.33 times normal global end-diastolic volume index represents the upper limit of patent cardiac preload responsiveness, with the highest expected responsiveness being below 0.67 times normal global end-diastolic volume index. The maximum response of the Frank-Starling relationship and therefore the level of no additional preload reserve is 1.33 to 1.51 times normal global end-diastolic volume index. Above 1.51 times normal global end-diastolic volume index preload responsiveness is unlikely, and the risk of pulmonary edema is maximal.",2015,General & Internal Medicine; Pediatrics
STEM CELL AND BIOTECHNOLOGICAL PATENTABILITY AND RESEARCH IN THE EUROPEAN UNION: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH,; ,"Stem cell and biotechnological research is a flourishing industry around the globe. The growth of the industry can be attributed to its promise to lead to a cure for numerous human diseases that are currently considered unconquered. Within this industry, the patentability of researched innovations has been a hot topic in the past decade. Through the patenting process, the industry itself can be a source of economic opportunity for countries willing to extend patent protection for the inventions produced by stem cell and biotechnological research. Because it takes significant resources for research to produce a patentable invention, investors desire assurances that their time and money will head a result from which they can benefit, whether that be a financial benefit, a status benefit, or some other benefit. Despite the medical promises of stem cell and biotechnological research, there are concerns in some places around the world such as the European Union about potential policy implications that would stem from patenting innovations in this industry. These concerns are displayed in the two leading sources of law governing stem cell and biotechnological research: the European Union's Directive 98/44/EC and the European Patent Convention. This Article discusses the patentability of stem cell and biotechnological inventions under both European Union law and the European Patent Convention. The Article continues by discussing several other topics that a practitioner must be familiar with when analyzing a patentability issue. A few of these topics include the morality debate, the promise of stem cell and biotechnological research, taxation of stem cell-related products, access to records, legal notice, research funding, and the free movement of goods. This Article also examines the key case law from both the European Court of Justice as well as the two judicial organs of the European Patent Office, the Board of Appeal and the Enlarged Board of Appeal, that provide insight into this area of law. Additionally, this Article identifies the discrepancies between the law governing stem cell research and biotechnological research within the European continent and provides recommendations for greater harmonization within these two areas of law.",2018,Government & Law

THE TIPPING POINT - REEVALUATING THE ASNEF-EQUIFAX SEPARATION OF COMPETITION OF DATA PRIVACY LAW IN THE WAKE OF THE 2017 EQUIFAX DATA BREACH,; DATA PROTECTION,"Contrary to the Court of Justice for the European Union's decision in the Asnef-Equifax case, in a world of big data, it is inefficient and ineffective to treat EU competition law and EU data protection law as entirely separate legal considerations. Reevaluating this stance is critical in sectors where customer data is highly sensitive, and therefore highly valuable to those who steal it, particularly for the financial and healthcare sectors. Looking forward, companies that store and use biometric data will have to be similarly scrutinized. To correct this problem, the EU has numerous paths it can take: (a) continue as is, treating competition and data protection as separate legal considerations, (b) enact a new body of regulatory law to specifically deal with data protection and competition, or (c) begin using existing competition law, specifically Article 101 of the TFEU, to address data protection concerns. This paper will argue that to best serve the interests of all relevant players - government, businesses, and consumers - option (c) is the optimal choice. Additionally, in implementing this change, the EU can use the FRAND patent and competition law precedence in devising a new data protection and competition framework.",2018,Government & Law

This paper develops an endogenous growth framework with two open economies satisfying the classical North-South assumptions to study (a) the regions' incentives to enforce IPRs in a decentralized game, (b) the desired IPR enforcement of the two regions in negotiation rounds on global harmonization, and (c) the constrained efficient enforcement level. We show how the different solutions relate to each other and how the results depend on the research productivity in the North and the regions' relative market sizes. Although growth rates increase substantially when IPR enforcement is harmonized at the North's desired level, our numerical simulation suggests that the South may also benefit in terms of long-run welfare.",2015,Business & Economics
How does green technology influence CO2 emission in China? - An empirical research based on provincial data of China,CO2 Emissions; Green patent; STIRPAT Model; Regional effect; IMPACT FACTORS; INNOVATION; ENERGY; POPULATION; STIRPAT; CONSUMPTION; SPILLOVERS; DIFFUSION; US,"This paper investigates the role of green innovations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions as a factor that compensates for growth and population effects. It has been shown from tests that the positive effect of green innovations on carbon emissions exists within a STIRPAT framework from a local perspective. The panel data is derived from China Statistical Yearbook and China Intellectual Property Office covered from 1999 to 2013. In addition,the static panel model was run to estimate the diversity among three typical regions of China. The main result shows that the green technology change has not played a dominant role yet in promoting environmental protection, while a scale effect (Affluence and Population)still prevails, although green patents show positive influences on the CO, emission reduction inthe whole country as well as the East and West regions, except the Central region. Moreover, it turns out that the classical EKC hypothesis does stand in China, referring to the three regions with the inverted U shape.

The analysis of the patent portfolio of a company as well as its evolution in the time line is of interest for technology analysts and decision makers. However, the need for the participation of experts in the field of a company as well as patent specialists, slows down the process. Bibliometrics and text mining techniques contribute to the interpretation of specialists. The present paper tries to offer a step by step procedure to analyze the technology strategy of several companies through the analysis of their portfolio claims, combined with the use of TechMining with the help of a text mining tool. The procedure, complemented with a semantic TRIZ analysis provides key insights in disclosing the technological analysis of some competitors in the field of probiotics for livestock health. The results show interesting shifts in the key probiotic and prebiotic ingredients for which companies claim protection and therefore offers clues about their technology intention in the life sciences industry in a more dynamic, convenient and simple way.",2017,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science
Open innovation and IPRs: Mutually incompatible or complementary institutions?,Open innovation; IPRs; Knowledge spillovers; R&D; ,"In this paper, we explain the analytics of a particular type of mechanism of open innovation (OI), namely the management of non-pecuniary exchange of information, and address the relationship between intellectual property rights (IPRs), particularly patent rights, and OI using a static game-theoretic setting of research and development (R&D) competition. We develop a duopoly model in which for-profit firms can contribute to downstream improvements to be made by a diverse community of inventors, workers and users of technology by creating knowledge spillovers which the development community employs as an input for its innovative efforts. Although a money market for R&D information does not exist, the commercial firms may appropriate an indirect return on innovative efforts. The degree of spillover information is determined endogenously, and equilibria with voluntary revealing may arise in our theoretical model. We show that, surprisingly perhaps, a rise in the strength of patent protection induces the free sharing and dissemination of technological information and other contributions to the OI development of innovations. Conversely, a fall in the strength of the patent system induces the exercise of traditional IPRs by innovative firms to protect their intellectual assets. (C) 2018 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge.

The relationship between intellectual property and human right and a policy oriented recommendations,Human right; Intellectual Property; Health Right; Right to Life; Patents; ,"The objective of this review is to analyze possible interrelation and conflicts between intellectual property law and human right, with particular attention to the right of health, as well as their impact on social acceptability and effectiveness of the legal norms. Intellectual property protection has been debated for long time because of its impact on the society and the environment. It is important to take into consideration when nation do not adopt the legislation as it makes a back step historically in the protection of human due to the fact that the importance of human rights is established by it's implementation. We will examine different legal mechanism that are used and can be used in order to balance the interest involved, focusing on human rights norms recognized by national and international law. We aim to analyze the different aspects of the relationship between human rights and Intellectual property with a special focus on the right of health. Intellectual property protection, have implication on the right to health and related human rights in a different ways. Intellectual property protection can affect medical research and the access to medicines. We will see how medicines are of decisive importance for the preservation and maintenance of the health of citizens, especially in developing countries which justifies the special attention that governments give to their regulation. A balance must be sought between these international rights and access to medicines by patients in developing countries at affordable prices. Companies need to use patents not only as incentives and mechanisms of innovation, but as strategic assets for the generation and conservation of dominant positions. We will set policy-oriented recommendations with the aim to enhance social acceptability and legitimacy of intellectual property law and guidelines on development of intellectual property norms.",2019,Government & Law

Lessons learned: a framework methodology for human rights impact assessment of intellectual property protections in trade agreements,Human rights; health; human rights impact assessment; intellectual property; international trade; affordable medicines; HEALTH; ACCESS; POLICY,"Currently, two billion people lack regular access to essential medicines in contradiction of their right to health under international law. With the rapid growth of intellectual property provisions in international trade agreements in recent years, governments are increasingly bound to provide stringent patent protection to pharmaceuticals, resulting in higher drug prices, which exacerbate the inaccessibility of medicines. As a result, there is a growing consensus in human rights and public health communities that policy-makers should ensure that trade agreements do not negatively affect the right to health, and moreover that human rights impact assessment offers a pragmatic and increasingly well-considered framework for achieving this aim. Drawing on numerous case studies and international human rights standards, this article proposes a pragmatic framework methodology for non-governmental organizations to carry out human rights impact assessment of trade-related intellectual property protections as part of their advocacy campaigns.",2016,Environmental Sciences & Ecology
Trend on the protection of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources within intellectual property chapters of Free Trade Agreements: the Peruvian experience,; ,"During negotiations of Free Trade Agreements, the bargaining power of developed countries has pushed developing countries to yield to higher standards of intellectual property protection in exchange of commercial benefits. However, there is evidence that developing countries can also seek and ensure the adoption of measures aimed at safeguarding their legitimate interests as a result of these negotiations. An example is Peru, which has sought to ensure the inclusion of provisions to require patent applicants to disclose the origin of the genetic resources and the associated traditional knowledge when they are used in the development of an invention, as well as the presentation of the evidence as to the prior informed consent from their legitimate owners and the corresponding equitable benefit-sharing.

Despite the recent US position, the United States has not always been a leading IPR advocate. Rather, it was a leading IPR violator during the nineteenth century. An institution-based view of IPR history suggests that both the US refusal to protect foreign IPR in the nineteenth century and the current Chinese lack of enthusiasm to meet US IPR demands represent rational choices. However, as cost-benefit considerations change institutional transitions are possible. We predict that to the same extent the United States voluntarily agreed to strengthen IPR protection when its economy became sufficiently innovation-driven, China will similarly improve its IPR protection.",2017,Business & Economics

In addition to the market exclusivity provided by patents, the pharmaceutical industry has also sought to further extend their monopolies by advocating the need for additional 'regulatory' protection for new medicines, known as data exclusivity. Data exclusivity limits the use of clinical trial data that need to be submitted to the regulatory authorities before a new drug can enter the market. For a specified period, generic competitors cannot apply for regulatory approval for equivalent drugs relying on the originator's data. As a consequence, data exclusivity lengthens the monopoly for the original drug, impairing the availability of generic drugs. This article illustrates how the pharmaceutical industry has convinced the US and the EU to impose data exclusivity on their trade partners, many of them developing countries. The key arguments formulated by the pharmaceutical industry in favor of adopting data exclusivity and their underlying ethical assumptions are described in this article, analyzed, and found to be unconvincing. Contrary to industry's arguments, it is unlikely that data exclusivity will promote innovation, especially in developing countries. Moreover, the industry's appeal to a property rights claim over clinical test data and the idea that data exclusivity can prevent the generic competitors from 'free-riding' encounters some important problems: Neither legitimize excluding all others.",2017,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics
Is Compulsory Licensing Bad for Public Health? Some Critical Comments on Drug Accessibility in Developing Countries,; ESSENTIAL MEDICINES; DEVELOPING-NATIONS; ACCESS; THAILAND; BRAZIL; INNOVATION; PATENTS; CANADA,"As one of the flexibilities provided by the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) establishing minimum standards for the protection of property rights, compulsory license (CL) represents a means towards the protection of public health issues within a context of stringent protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs), most notably in poor-resource settings. However, recent literature asserts that CL constitutes a serious limitation to the full enjoyment of property rights by innovators and may therefore threaten drug accessibility in developing countries. This paper outlines the impact of CL on drug accessibility in developing countries by addressing the three main dimensions of accessibility (availability, affordability and quality) and proceeding to a literature survey of key arguments for and against CL. It concludes that CL inhibits neither the availability of essential drugs nor the affordability of life-saving treatments or the supply of high- quality drugs in developing countries, in particular antiretroviral drugs.",2017,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services
New medical uses of known medical devices - A new prespective on purpose-limited product protection for medical devices in Europe,; ,"Medical products/devices belong to a technical field attracting increasing importance in recent years in view of a growing number of applications. However, according to the prevailing jurisprudence of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO), they generally do not enjoy the novelty privilege provided by Art. 54(4) und (5) EPC, as this is said to be applicable only to classical medicaments. According to the current approach, it is decisive whether the subject is a substance or a composition. Although these terms may be interpreted broadly, obtaining patent protection for new uses of known med-tech products was successful only in narrowly-defined and limited cases. In a recently published decision, a Board of Appeal for the first time gave a detailed explanation of the narrow interpretation of the aforementioned terms and further refined the jurisprudence with respect to medical products/devices. This article reviews the legal development and summarizes the current status on the subject. It then critically deals with the current considerations of the EPO Boards of Appeal regarding the narrow interpretation of Art. 54(4) and (5) EPC and presents arguments in favor of a broader interpretation.

Three key reasons why Nigerian law and policy makers should pay attention to plant variety protection are the country's evolving agricultural sector, susceptibility to external pressures and pending international obligations. From 2010, successive Nigerian governments have promoted private sector investments in agriculture, contributing to the increase in the number of agribusinesses in the country. Agribusinesses tend to lobby for the introduction or reform of national plant variety protection systems to suit their business interests. Furthermore, as a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Nigeria has a pending obligation under Article 27.3(b) of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to protect plant varieties through a patent system, a sui generis system, or a combination of systems. This article argues that Nigeria should proactively introduce a plant variety protection system designed to suit its socio-economic realities before it is pressured to adopt an unsuitable system. In assessing the options under TRIPS vis-a-vis the small-scale centered agricultural sector in Nigeria, the article finds that the best-suited option for the country is a sui generis system which protects the interests of both small-scale farmers and agribusinesses.",2019,Government & Law

Does the Trademark Protection Regulation Protect Consumers against Counterfeit Products? Analyzing the Theories of Trademark and Indonesian Trademark Law,Counterfeit products; Indonesian trademark law; Intellectual property law; ,"Consumer protection against resellers infringing intellectual property (IP) is not guaranteed based on Consumer Protection Act No. 8 of 1999 because it is argued that it is already regulated under IP laws, such as patent, trademark, and copyright laws, prohibiting the production or sale of products infringing IP law. However, because the nature of IP is to protect private rights, how can trademarks protect consumers? This paper analyzes trademark theories and the Trademarks Act No. 20 of 2016 to establish whether trademarks protect consumers. This research concludes that most scholars use utilitarian and economic theories, supporting that trademarks protect consumers by balancing the trademark holder's economic right with the interests of the public as consumers. However, Trademarks Act No. 20 provides very limited protection with only legal, philosophical arguments. Further protection is limited to simply safeguarding consumers from being misled or deceived by stipulation that a potential trademark is distinctive and not registered in bad faith. It neither provides any legal instrument for consumers injured or having suffered any loss nor allows consumers to report counterfeit goods or be reimbursed for loss or injury from buying those goods. Therefore, protecting customers is not the Indonesian trademark law's primary objective.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Before launching the world largest ETS, China experimented with seven independent regional pilots, whose effects are only indirectly explored. Here we provide firm-level evidence of the innovation effect directly from China's pilot emissions trading, based on latest patenting information and a quasi-experimental design. China's pilots increase low-carbon innovation of ETS firms by 5-10% without crowding out their other technology innovation. The increase from ETS firms accounts for about 1% increase of the regional low-carbon patents, while a similar increase from large non-ETS firms is also induced by the ETS. Most importantly, the effect is not associated with permit price, auction, or firm characteristics, but is driven by mass-based allowance allocation.

An essential difference across innovation systems is whether disclosure is of intermediate progress and solutions or of completed innovations. We theorize and present experimental evidence linking intermediate versus final disclosure to an 'incentives-versus-reuse' tradeoff and to a transformation of the innovation search process. We find intermediate disclosure has the advantage of efficiently steering development towards improving existing solution approaches, but also has the effect of limiting experimentation and narrowing technological search. We discuss the comparative advantages of intermediate versus final disclosure policies in fostering innovation. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",2015,Business & Economics
BROADLY UNPATENTABLE: HOW BROAD METHOD CLAIMS HAVE LIMITED PATENTABILITY OF DIAGNOSTIC INVENTIONS,; ON-A-CHIP; RECENT PROGRESS,"Diagnostic tests are often patented using broad method claims, which allow inventors to secure the greatest possible protection for their inventions. However, several recent Supreme Court and Federal Circuit cases invalidated broad diagnostic method claims under 35 U.S.C. 101, holding that the claims were directed to unpatentable abstract ideas, natural laws, or natural phenomena. In light of these decisions, the continued patentability of diagnostic inventions has been called into question. However, this Note argues that these invalidations were partially due to the breadth of the claims at issue and that diagnostic inventions may still survive 101 challenges if they are claimed narrowly using machine, manufacture, or composition of matter claims rather than or in addition to method claims. Additionally, this Note endorses Judge Timothy B. Dyk's proposal for allowing patenting of diagnostic inventions that use conventional laboratory steps to detect novel analytes so long as the claims are narrowly tailored and actually reduced to practice.",2019,Government & Law

This paper also attempts to understand whether this complementary effect is significantly different across China's eastern, central and western regions. Design/methodology/approach The study sample comprised 28 provinces involved in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China from 2003 to 2014. Ordinary least squares was used to test the complementary effects of GRSs and IPR protection on innovation performance. The seemingly unrelated estimation test was also applied to ascertain whether differences existed between the eastern and western regions. Findings A complementary effect between GRSs and IPR protection in terms of improving the innovation of pharmaceutical manufacturers was found to exist only in eastern and western regions. There was no significant difference in the complementary effect between GRSs and IPR protection in terms of improving innovation among the three regions. Without considering the interaction effect of GRSs and IPR protection, the GRSs were negatively associated with innovation in the eastern region, but positively related to the innovation in central region. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on government policies and innovation by incorporating the interaction effect of GRSs and IPR protection on innovation in the context of a high-tech industry (pharmaceutical manufacturing) in an emerging economy (China). It also explores the internal differences in the influence of this complementary effect on innovation in an emerging economy, enriching the institution-based view.",2019,Business & Economics
Innovation collaboration and appropriability by knowledge-intensive business services firms,Patent; Appropriability; Innovation collaboration; Open innovation; Services; Knowledge-intensive services; Intellectual property rights; OPENNESS; STRATEGY; MODEL; CAPABILITIES; PROTECTION; PARADOX; PATENTS; SEARCH; GROWTH,"We uncover a paradox of formal appropriability mechanisms in the case of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) firms. Despite evidence that KIBS firms do not typically consider formal appropriability mechanisms, such as patents, to be central mechanisms for capturing value from innovation, we show that they are nevertheless important for their innovation collaboration. Drawing on an original survey of publicly-traded UK and US KIBS firms, we find a significant positive association between the importance of innovation collaboration and the importance of formal appropriability mechanisms. We interrogate the evidence for clients, as they are the most important partners for innovation collaboration. We find that the importance of innovation collaboration with clients goes hand-in-hand with the importance of formal appropriability mechanisms, although a negative relation appears when firms assign very high importance to formal appropriability mechanisms. Thus, modest levels of emphasis on formal appropriability mechanisms may prevent conflicts over ownership of jointly developed knowledge assets and knowledge leakages, while also avoiding the possibly negative effects of overly strict controls by legal departments on innovation collaboration. As well as exploring formal appropriability mechanisms, we also investigate the relationship between contractual and strategic appropriability mechanisms and innovation collaboration for KIBS firms. 2016 The Authors.

Middle managers may curtail the rate and scope of innovation when executives are expected to reduce their innovation involvement. We test our prediction by exploiting a natural experiment in Delaware where court rulings increased takeover protection for Delaware firms. Difference-in-differences estimates show that increased takeover protection reduced the rate of innovation by firms, and that it also reduced the scope of innovation across several key dimensions (technological, temporal, organizational, and international). Consistent with our argument, we find that the negative effect of takeover protection on innovation was weaker for larger firms, where innovation decision making authority is more likely to be delegated to middle managers and executive involvement is lower. Finally, we examine the substitutive relationship between competitive pressures from the takeover market and the product market, and find that the negative effect of takeover protection on innovation was stronger for firms facing low competitive pressure from the product market.

We hypothesize that, when the above mechanisms are not available, firms are more likely to fragment processes across multiple foreign production units instead of collocating all process tasks in the same unit. Thanks to IT-enabled integration capabilities, firms can exploit the complementarities between the dispersed fragments of a process while reducing the misappropriation hazard of individual fragments. Empirical results and robustness tests are strongly congruent with these hypotheses. We find also that the propensity to turn to the process fragmentation protection mechanism increases with firm host-country-specific experience and with the alternative value of the proprietary information involved in the activity sourced abroad.",2016,Business & Economics

We further investigate how direct and nominee shareholder structures in ECF firms are associated with firm performance. Research findings/insightsWe find that ECF firms have 8.5 times higher failure rates than matched NECF firms. However, 3.4 times more ECF firms have patent applications than matched NECF firms. Within the group of ECF firms, we find that ECF firms financed through a nominee structure make smaller losses, whereas ECF firms financed through a direct shareholder structure have more new patent applications, including foreign patent applications. Theoretical/academic implicationsOur findings suggest that there are important adverse selection issues on equity crowdfunding platforms, although these platforms also serve as a catalyst for innovative activities. Moreover, our findings suggest that there is a more complex relationship between dispersed versus concentrated crowd shareholders and firm performance than currently assumed in the literature. Practitioner/policy implicationsFor policy makers and crowdfunding platforms, investor protection against adverse selection will be important to ensure the sustainability of equity crowdfunding markets. For entrepreneurs and crowd investors, our study highlights how equity crowdfunding and the adopted shareholder structure relate to short-term firm performance.",2018,Business & Economics

This study aims to answer this question by examining the impact of the key determinants of IP appropriability, namely organizational resources, IP management practices and organizational learning culture, on innovation performance. The study uses quantitative survey data obtained from the Australian biotechnology, pharmaceutical and ICT industries in order to test several hypotheses. Our results show that exploitation and protection of IP within an organisational learning culture have a significant effect on the firm's innovation performance. The implication for managers is that IP appropriation is likely to be most successful when trade secrets and profits from innovation are applied simultaneously within an organizational learning culture.",2018,Business & Economics
Great expectations: Learning the boundaries of design rights,Intellectual property right; Design right; Uncertainty; Beliefs; Learning; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PATENT; INNOVATION; MARKET; FIRMS; INCENTIVES; STRATEGIES; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; LITIGATION,"We present a case study of an increase in design right filings and concurrent design right litigations in an industry that previously had little experience of design right protection. The motives for and outcomes of filing, and how these changed over time are discussed. We go on to explore the events, which offered the decision makers opportunities to update their beliefs about the scope of design right protection. We find that filing motives changed from specific protection goals to freedom to operate over time. We also find that the actors faced several, but sometimes contradictory, learning opportunities. There are two types of learning relating to the usage of design rights: 1) learning the initial scope of protection and 2) learning the dynamism of scope that results from the growing number of designs in the product category. The evidence suggests that the scope of existing design rights is negatively affected by new design right grants. Our findings highlight the essential role of belief formation and updating in innovation activity and intellectual property rights-based competition. We conclude that uncertain design rights and information asymmetries may have fostered entrepreneurial optimism.",2019,Business & Economics
Layer Protecting the Surface of Zirconium Used in Nuclear Reactors,ESCA; plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; Raman spectroscopy; SEM; thin polycrystalline diamond film; Zircaloy2 pins protection against oxidation; DIAMOND FILMS; THIN-FILMS; ALLOYS; SPECTROSCOPY; CORROSION; FUEL,"Background: Zirconium alloys have very useful properties for nuclear facilities applications having low absorption cross-section of thermal electrons, high ductility, hardness and corrosion resistance. However, there is also a significant disadvantage: it reacts with water steam and during this (oxidative) reaction it releases hydrogen gas, which partly diffuses into the alloy forming zirconium hydrides. A new strategy for surface protection of zirconium alloys against undesirable oxidation in nuclear reactors by polycrystalline diamond film has been patented-Czech patent 305059: Layer protecting the surface of zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors and PCT patent: Layer for protecting surface of zirconium alloys (Patent Number: WO2015039636-A1). The zirconium alloy surface was covered by polycrystalline diamond layer grown in plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition apparatus with linear antenna delivery system. Substantial progress in the description and understanding of the polycrystalline diamond/ zirconium alloys interface and material properties under standard and nuclear reactors conditions (irradiation, hot steam oxidation experiments and heating-quenching cycles) was made. In addition, process technology for the deposition of protective polycrystalline diamond films onto the surface of zirconium alloys was optimized. Results: Zircaloy2 nuclear fuel pins were covered by 300 nm thick protective polycrystalline diamond layer (PCD) using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition apparatus with linear antenna delivery system. The polycrystalline diamond layer protects the zirconium alloy surface against undesirable oxidation and consolidates its chemical stability while preserving its functionality. PCD covered Zircaloy2 and standard Zircaloy2 pins were for 30 min. oxidized in 1100 degrees C hot steam. Under these conditions alpha phase of zirconium changes to beta phase (more opened for oxygen/ hydrogen diffusion). PCD anticorrosion protection of Zircaloy nuclear fuel assemblies can significantly prolong lifetime of Zirconium alloy in nuclear reactors even above Zirconium phase transition temperatures. Even after ion beam irradiation (10 dpa, 3 MeV Fe2+) the diamond film still shows satisfactory structural integrity with both sp(3) and sp(2) carbon phases. Zircaloy2 under the carbon-based protective layer after hot steam oxidation test differed from the original Zircaloy2 material composition only very slightly, proving that the diamond coating increases the material resistance to high temperature oxidation. Conclusions: Zirconium alloys nuclear fuel pins' surfaces were covered by compact and homogeneous polycrystalline diamond layers consisting of sp(3) and sp(2) carbon phases with a high crystalline diamond content and low roughness. Diamond withstands very high temperatures, has excellent thermal conductivity and low chemical reactivity, it does not degrade over time and (important for the nuclear fuel cladding) being pure carbon, it has perfect neutron cross-section properties. Moreover, polycrystalline diamond layers consisting of crystalline (sp(3)) and amorphous (sp(2)) carbon phases could have suitable thermal expansion. Zirconium alloys coated with polycrystalline diamond film are protected against undesirable changes and processes. Further, the polycrystalline diamond layer prevents the reaction between the alloy surface and water vapor. During such reaction, water molecules dissociate and initiate formation of zirconium dioxide and hydrogen, accompanied by the release of large amount of heat. Thus the protective layer prevents the formation of hydrogen and the release of reaction heat. Few relevant patents to the topic have been reviewed and cited.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics

Unlike existing studies, this study explicitly distinguishes IPR protection and IPR enforcement by incorporating illegal imitation and seizure activity into the model. The four main results are, first, a higher seizure rate does not always decrease imitation rate in the South. Second, a higher seizure rate does not always encourage innovation in the North. Third, although a sufficiently high seizure rate is required to enhance economic growth, such a policy reform would deteriorates welfare in both the North and South. Finally, unlike seizure, prohibiting imports of illegal imitations from the South always lowers illegal imitation.",2015,Business & Economics

Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been the dominant energy storage technology for applications in consumer electronics, electrified transportation and stationary electricity storage, further technological progress is required for achieving the climate protection objectives. In this context, continuous exploration of new technological opportunities is favorable to advance the global energy transition towards sustainability to success. To facilitate such progress and to avoid potential technological lock-in situation, understanding the underlying latent knowledge construct revealed in patents may prove beneficial. However, previous studies have either focused on analyzing the technological improvements along a particular development path or emphasizing the necessity for improvements in environmental-economic dimensions. Accordingly, a novel patent-based analysis framework is proposed to obtain an inclusive view on the continuing path of technology development concerning the research of LIBs as well as to predict its future development potential based on two machine learning algorithms: Principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest classifier (RFC). In this study, PCA is firstly applied to group various knowledge areas into key technological knowledge stocks. Building upon these results, RFC is adopted to forecast the future developmental potential of technological knowledge areas. The findings show that the research landscape of LIBs is a dynamic environment where new knowledge stocks emerged overtime and the identified knowledge stocks within a defined time interval play an orchestrating role in the advancement of lithium-ion battery technology. In particular, knowledge stocks related to battery management system and hybrid capacitors have gained relevance. The proposed analysis framework can be used to track the past chronology of knowledge accumulation trajectory and can proactively enhance the knowledge management capabilities of experts, who wish to create a path towards a low-carbon economy.

It adopts a gravity model for unbalanced panel data of China's 146 important trading partners over the period of 2002-2012. To eliminate the effects of FDI in determining the linkage between IPR and exports, the panel excludes the destination countries and territories that invest in China. The results reveal that the level of IPR protection in destination countries has a positive impact on China's flow of exports. Further analysis on data disaggregated by IPR score demonstrates that a higher level of IPR protection in destination countries and territories is positively linked with China's exports of these items in each of the IPR protection clusters and indicates a strong market power effect by the interplay between R&D expenditure and IPR in the destinations. Finally, both market power and market expansion effects are found to be prevalent in the destinations, as implied by the coefficient of IPR protection disaggregated by income level of China's export destinations. The results generally resemble those in the literature that describe the linkage between IPR protection and trade flows.",2016,Business & Economics

The purpose of this study was to assess the grain quality properties of ex-PVP maize short-season inbred lines. Three sets of North Carolina Mating Design II crosses were made with 12 NDSU lines, 24 ex-PVP lines, and seven current industry testers in the 2010 and 2010-2011 seasons. Hybrids and checks were arranged in partially balanced lattice trials across six ND environments in 2011 and 2012. Both general combining ability and specific combining ability were important for regulating most grain quality traits with the preponderance of additive genetic variance. However, there is still lack of interest for developing inbred lines and hybrids with top grain quality traits. If ex-PVP inbred lines do not have the potential to compete with current lines, still, those with good combining ability for grain quality could complement other germplasm sources when the market is ready to pay premiums for a better maize quality.

Moreover, it is a tool for female self-protection against HIV, making it highly relevant to sub-Saharan regions, where women have the highest infection burden. To date, Truvada is the only medication for PrEP. However, the cost of Truvada limits its uptake in resource-constrained countries. Similarly, several currently investigated, patent-protected compounds may be unaffordable in these regions. We set out to explore the potential of the patent-expired antiviral efavirenz (ERV) as a cost-efficient PrEP alternative. A population pharmacokinetic model utilizing data from the ENCORE1 study was developed. The model was refined for metabolic autoinduction. We then explored EFV cellular uptake mechanisms, finding that it is largely determined by plasma protein binding. Next, we predicted the prophylactic efficacy of various EFV dosing schemes after exposure to HIV using a stochastic simulation framework. We predicted that plasma concentrations of 11, 36, 1287 and 1486ng/mL prevent 90% sexual transmissions with wild type and Y181C, K103N and G190S mutants, respectively. Trough concentrations achieved after 600 mg once daily dosing (median: 2017 ng/mL, 95% CI:445-9830) and after reduced dose (400 mg) efavirenz (median: 1349ng/mL, 95% CI: 297-6553) provided complete protection against wild-type virus and the Y181C mutant, and median trough concentrations provided about 90% protection against the K103N and G190S mutants. As reduced dose ER/ has a lower toxicity profile, we predicted the reduction in HIV infection when 400 mg EFV-PrEP was poorly adhered to, when it was taken on demand and as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Once daily EFV-PrEP provided 99% protection against wild-type virus, if >= 50% of doses were taken. PrEP on demand provided complete protection against wild-type virus and prevented >= 81% infections in the mutants. PEP could prevent >98% infection with susceptible virus when initiated within 24 h after virus exposure and continued for at least 9 days. We predict that 400 mg oral ER/ may provide superior protection against wild-type HIV. However, further studies are warranted to evaluate ER/ as a cost-efficient alternative to Truvada. Predicted prophylactic concentrations may guide release kinetics of ER/ long-acting formulations for clinical trial design.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
"Intellectual Property (IP) and Intellectual Property Right (IPR), Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Protection of Traditional Medical Knowledge (TMK)",Intellectual property (IP); Intellectual property right (IPR); Traditional knowledge(TK); ,"Intellectual property (IP), creations of the mind, has both a moral and a commercial value. Traditional medical knowledge, such as the medicinal use of herbs, is often associated with genetic resources. Herbal genetic resources exist in nature and are not creations of the human mind; therefore, they cannot be directly protected as intellectual property (IP). They are subject to access and benefit-sharing regulations under international agreements. Patents based on traditional Indian medicine have included the use of turmeric for healing wounds; the antifungal properties of neem and a diabetes medicine made from extract of black plum (Syzygium cumini) were subsequently revoked. IP includes inventions, literary and artistic works, designs and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected by patents, copyright, trademarks, trade secret, geographical indication, etc. IP law grants the author of an intellectual creation exclusive right for exploiting and benefiting from their creation. Intellectual property right (IPR) is a right of a person or a company to have exclusive authority over the use of its own plans, ideas, or other intangible assets without the worry of competition. This right safeguards creators and other producers and may be enforced by a court via a lawsuit. The plant variety protection and farmers rights act enacted in many countries of the world was designed to protect the new plant and crop variety. On April 26 every year, we celebrate World Intellectual Property Day to promote discussion of the role of IP in encouraging innovation and creativity. According to Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary, or artistic production of which he is the author. The ethical problems brought up by intellectual property rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life-saving medicines and genetically modified seeds that are given intellectual property protection. Traditional knowledge (TK) about the use of medicinal herbs of many nations is highly valuable. TK of various communities has even led to discovery and development of drugs like digitalis, morphine, colchicine, artemisinin, podophyllotoxin, salicin, etc., from various plant species. Biodiversity rich regions of various continents across the globe harbor flora of immense medicinal importance. The fastest growing international drug market for botanical medicines has seriously affected many species almost to the level of extinction because many of their ruthless exploitation in an unsystematic manner. The traditional knowledge is drawing global attention, popularity, and patronization due to awareness regarding the side effects of allopath but this has made the traditional knowledge system prone to `biopiracy' and `patenting' both within the country of origin as well as outside. The false claim on novelty and use of indigenous knowledge for commercial benefits needs to be checked. It is essential not only to preserve the traditional and indigenous knowledge but also to preserve the biodiversity of a locality and culture of the indigenous people from wrongful ownership. The major International Regulations effecting IPRs and traditional knowledge are Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs). The provisions of TRIPs and CBD have tried to develop a system of protection of traditional knowledge globally, which needs to be further strengthened in terms of providing incentives for disclosure and dissemination of valuable traditional knowledge. The disclosure and dissemination of traditional knowledge is to be achieved by linking the grassroots knowledge systems with the global opportunities for financing the commercial use of biological diversity. The developing countries have a rich abundance of indigenous and local knowledge systems, and documentation of this knowledge is of prime importance. This documentation in electronic format would serve as a databank for searching for information before grant of patent and would register the traditional use patterns.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
"SPECULATIVE PROFITS, INNOVATION, AND GROWTH",; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ACCUMULATION; INFORMATION; INVESTMENT,"When technological change affects the prices of tradeable assets, innovators can obtain speculative profits by exploiting their inside information as to the occurrence of innovations. We propose a tractable model of endogenous growth that formalizes this argument, originally due to Hirshleifer (1971). We then use the model to assess two claims advanced by Hirshleifer, namely, that speculative profits can generate excessive investment in R&D when they add to monopoly rents guaranteed by patent protection, or else even in a perfectly competitive economy. The analysis confirms the first claim, but casts doubts on the second one. (JEL O30, O40)",2017,Business & Economics

What Is a Biosimilar?,; ,"Biosimilars, also known as 'follow-on biologics', are biopharmaceutical products developed with the aim to mimic an innovator product as closely as possible, once the relevant patent protection has expired. Biosimilars and the corresponding innovator products are typically therapeutic proteins that may have the same amino acid sequence but for which complete identity is hard to achieve in practice due to the complex nature of protein structures. In most territories, the approval process for biosimilars requires the execution of clinical trials. Typically, the approval of a biosimilar product does not automatically imply interchangeability with the innovator product. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel",2015,Oncology; Gastroenterology & Hepatology

REEFS can harness both, potential energy as well as kinetic energy, of sea waves. Its structure consists of a nearshore fixed submerged caisson placed on the seabed at low depth. REEFS can contribute to shore protection because it originates storm waves breaking like natural reefs do. Due to its stay vanes and variable porosity enveloping surface the REEFS WEC creates an inner sea water flow that drives a low head turbine located inside the device. In this paper a detailed description of the REEFS concept comprising its most relevant characteristics and its theoretical functioning principles is presented. The 1.5:100 small scale laboratory functional proof of concept is described and the corresponding results that confirmed the theoretical expectations are reported. Based on the experimental results, conclusions about the potential of the REEFS wave energy harnessing concept are presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although emigration may directly cause brain drain, it generates a flow of knowledge acquired by emigrants abroad back to their home countries, which could be exploited under sound IPR institutions. IPRs can thus stimulate domestic innovation by creating the right environment to absorb potential gains from international migration. Using a panel dataset of emerging and developing countries, we show that emigration has a favorable effect on strengthening the link between IPR protection and innovation by making a new source of knowledge available to domestic innovators.

Addition data were collected from public research institutes and universities and patent data from the Derwent Innovations Index database. It employs four count data models for the empirical analysis. Findings - This study finds a positive impact of public biotechnology (measured by the number of biotech patents of government research institutes and public universities) on commercial innovation measured by the number of patents granted to the commercial firms. As expected the firm's research expenditure and having their own R&D center (as opposed to contracting R&D or no R&D investment at all) have a positive and statistically significant effect on the number of patents granted. The impacts of public R&D investment spending have no statistically significant effect on commercial innovation. Multi-national firms and publicly traded firms have fewer patents than their counterparts suggesting that policies to encourage multi-nationals and financing through stock markets had no impact on innovation. Originality/value - This study is one of the first studies to untangle the relationship between government policies and innovation by commercial agricultural research output and public R&D investment and biotechnology. The main findings suggest that simply increasing research money to public research does not increase commercial innovations, but moving resources to the development patentable biotech does improve commercial research productivity. The results also suggest that policies to increase commercial research will also increase innovation. These could include strengthening the legal framework and institutional resources for public institutes to the protection and enforcement of intellectual properties.",2017,Agriculture; Business & Economics
Universal intellectual property rights: Too much of a good thing?,Intellectual property rights; Innovation; Imitation; Duopoly; Developing countries; PATENT PROTECTION; PARALLEL TRADE; INNOVATION; PRICE; PHARMACEUTICALS; DIFFERENTIATION; CHOICE,"Developing countries' incentives to protect intellectual property rights (IPR) are studied in a model of vertical innovation. Enforcing IPR boosts export opportunities to advanced economies but slows down technological transfers and incentives to invest in R&D. Asymmetric protection of IPR, strict in the North and lax in the South, leads in many cases to a higher world level of innovation than universal enforcement. IPR enforcement is U-shaped in the relative size of the export market compared to the domestic one: rich countries and small/poor countries enforce IPR, the former to protect their innovations, the latter to access foreign markets, while large emerging countries free-ride on rich countries' technology to serve their internal demand.

A 63-year-old male who had a history of two strokes and episodes of transient neurological deficit was diagnosed to have a small right-to-left shunt. At the time of PFO closure, an angiogram of the atrial septum revealed a small PFO associated with a RASP. The small PFO was crossed with a straight-tipped guide wire and was closed using a 25-mm GORE CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder (W.L. Gore and Associates, AZ). It is hypothesized that stagnant blood in the RASP may generate a clot that can cross the PFO and cause an infarct. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Factors Affecting Pricing in Patent Licensing Contracts in the Biopharmaceutical Industry,valuation; licensing deal; drug class; royalty rate; up-front fee; milestones; deal value; regression; biotech industry; attrition rate; TECHNOLOGY; PROTECTION; MARKET,"This paper analyzes factors affecting pricing in patent licensing contracts in the biopharmaceutical industry based on a dataset that includes royalty-related data such as running royalty rate, up-front payment, milestones, and deal value. Data on drug candidates for 11 drug classes is obtained for regression analysis between royalty-related data and multiple input descriptors such as market factors, licensor factors, and licensee factor in order to derive the formula for predicting royalty-related estimates such as royalty rate, up-front payment, milestones, and deal value. Data is gathered from multiple sources including MedTrack and is processed through merging and cleaning. We found that the three most important factors in pricing in patent licensing in the biopharmaceutical industry are CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), PDELR (Previous Deal Experience of Licensor), and AR (Attrition Rate). We found that factors in the formula used to estimate the license fee are totally different by drug class. We found that the three most important factors in the frequency in the formula used to estimate the license fee are PDELR, RnDLR (R&D Costs of Licensor), and PDELE (Previous Deal Experience of Licensee). This study suggests a method of estimating the proper royalty rate, up-front payment, milestones, and deal value of the drug candidates of 11 drug classes by using easily obtained input data.",2018,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
Formal and informal appropriation mechanisms: The role of openness and innovativeness,Appropriation mechanisms; Formal appropriation; Informal appropriation; External search openness; Incremental innovators; Radical innovators; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; CAPTURE VALUE; PATENTS; SEARCH; INNOVATIONS; PERFORMANCE; PROTECTION; APPROPRIABILITY; DISCLOSURE; STRATEGY,"This paper analyses how firms' degree of openness and innovativeness influence their use of formal and informal appropriation mechanisms. Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and design rights are formal appropriation mechanisms. Secrecy, lead-time, and complexity are examples of informal appropriation mechanisms. Both external search breadth and depth are positively associated with firms' use of informal appropriation mechanisms, while only external search breadth is positively associated with formal appropriation mechanisms. Finns' degree of radical (incremental) innovation orientation is negatively (positively) associated with their use of formal appropriation mechanisms. Analysis of the joint impact of openness and innovativeness, suggests that for radical innovators it is external search breadth (rather than depth) that has a positive association with the use of informal appropriation mechanisms. In contrast, for radical innovators external search depth (rather than breadth) is associated with the use of formal appropriation mechanisms. For incremental innovators, external search breadth (rather than depth) is associated with the use of both formal and informal appropriation mechanisms.",2017,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science

It is well known that indocyanine green is toxic to the retina and consequently not the ideal dye for chromovitrectomy. Different vital dyes has been tested for chromovitrectomy including trypan blue, patent blue, triamcinolone acetonide, infracyanine green, sodium fluorescein and brilliant blue. Brilliant blue seems to be the ideal dye for internal limiting membrane due to its afinity, lower toxic profile and to reduce the appearance of apoptosis. Besides the dye itself, the injection technique is crucial to avoid additional toxicity, slow injection, far from the retina and protection of the macular hole are some tips. More recently the use of dyes has been applied to stain perfluorcarbon liquids that may enhance its visualization during vitrectomy. (C) 2016 S.

CAPTURING VALUE FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) IN A GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT,Appropriation strategy; counterfeit; intellectual property rights; litigation; value capturing; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; STRATEGIES; PATENTS,"Globalization should provide firms with an opportunity to leverage their know-how and reputation across countries to create value. However, it remains challenging for them to actually capture that value using traditional Intellectual Property (IP) tools. In this paper, we document the strong growth in patents, trademarks, and industrial designs used by firms to protect their IP globally. We then show that IP protection remains fragmented; the quality of IP applications might be questionable; and developing a comprehensive IP footprint worldwide is very costly. Growing numbers of applications are causing backlogs and delays in numerous Patent and Trademarks Offices and litigation over IP rights is expensive, with an uncertain outcome. Moreover, local governments can succeed in transferring value to local firms and influencing global market positions by using IP laws and other regulations. In essence, the analysis shows a global IP environment that leaves much to be desired. Despite these challenges, there are successful strategies to capture value from know-how and reputation by leveraging an array of IP tools. These strategies have important implications for management practice, as we discuss in our concluding section. Global companies will need to organize cross-functional value capture teams focused on appropriating value from their know-how and reputation by combining different institutional, market, and nonmarket tools, depending on the institutional and business environment in a particular region.",2017,Business & Economics
Molecular identification of antelope horn by melting curve analysis,Antelope horn; Cyt b; identification; melting curve analysis; LINKED-IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY; PCR; DIFFERENTIATION; PRODUCT,"Antelope horn is a valuable Chinese traditional medicine and widely used in clinic. However, with the deterioration of antelope's living environment and a lot of killing, the saiga population begins falling and in some places plummet. Since the increasing demand of this expensive and good bioactive medicine, the horn of artiodactyla animals is often used as the antelope horn. The adulterated or impostor not only cause damage to clinical medicine but also affect the antelope resources protection and sustainable development. Here, in order to establish a melting curve analysis (MCA) method to distinguish the antelope horn from other animal horns and identify the decoction pieces and Chinese patent medicine in a fast and easy way, animal horns and its decoction pieces, Chinese patent medicines were collected from the market and the DNA of all the collected samples were extracted. The melting curve of two universal fragments (COI and Cyt b) was scanned and Cyt b was selected as feasibility fragment for identifying authentic antelope horn from eight adulterant animal horns. After optimizing the condition for MCA, inspecting the precision and the replication of the method, a reference melting curve modern was established and we performed MCA on the antelope horns, fakes, and adulterants on a 1: 1 mix, decoction pieces, and Chinese patent medicine. Thus, this study provides fast and easy methods so that MCA can detect the truth, fakes, and adulterations of antelope horns.",2016,Genetics & Heredity
Quantity and collection decisions in a closed-loop supply chain with technology licensing,Remanufacturing; Patented product; Fixed-fee licensing; Royalty licensing; Game theory; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TAKE-BACK; COMPETITION; STRATEGY; CONTRACTS; CHANNEL; MARKET; PRODUCTS,"Industry practice has shown that technology licensing has an important effect on the remanufacturing of patented products by third parties. Different licensing methods significantly impact a supply chain member's production and collection decisions, and they also have influential effects on reverse channel performance. However, there is scant literature investigating the decision on technology licensing and its impact on a supply chain member's production and collection decisions. To address this gap, we consider a manufacturer, as the patent holder, who produces new and remanufactured products and, simultaneously, he and a remanufacturer (as the licensee, who by law can only produce remanufactured products) competitively collects used products from the market in a two-period closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). We investigate two licensing patterns, fixed fee versus royalty, within the CLSC in a Cournot duopoly model. We find that royalty licensing is dominated by fixed fee licensing from the viewpoints of both the consumer surplus and environmental protection. Our result also shows that the manufacturer's optimal licensing strategy is determined by a threshold of the fixed fee: when the fixed fee is below a threshold, it is better for the manufacturer to use a royalty licensing, whereas fixed-fee licensing should be used when the fixed fee is higher than a threshold.

However, while international IP systems have radically transformed after the implementation of the TRIPS agreement, these contextual changes have not been accounted for in existing international management research approaches. This study examines the institutional context of IP systems in the post TRIPS implementation years by conceptualizing how IP Law on the books (regulations) and IP Law in practice (enforcement) combine. This enables the identification of two new contextual categories of IP systems that have not been conceptually, theoretically, or empirically captured in existing international management research. A review of the existing literature on indices measuring different aspects of national IP systems provides insights into how to improve future theoretical and empirical international management work that aims to study the effects of the context of IP systems in the post TRIPS era.",2019,Business & Economics

Results: A total of 18 drugs under patent protection or orphan drug designation for non-oncological UODs were identified. Furthermore, 29 ultra-orphan drugs for non-oncological diseases under development that have the potential of reaching the market by 2021 were found. Total budget impact over 10 years was estimated to be (sic)15,660 and (sic)4965 million for approved and pipeline ultra-orphan drugs, respectively (total: (sic)20,625 million).

Using the threat of imitation and wage differences of researchers across regions, this study proposes a partial equilibrium model to explain the lack of innovative R&D in developing countries. I build a North-South model examining a single firm's choice of research locations. The model predicts that weak IPR-protection in developing countries does not necessarily explain the lack of Southern research. In some situations, reduced IPR-protection can even increase Southern research. Harsh competition resulting from information leaks coupled with weak IPR-protection can explain much of the lack of innovative research investment in the developing world. My model also predicts that firms with low research needs, or firms in low-tech industries, locate their R&D in the North. Firms with medium research need locate in both countries while the firms with the largest research needs, or firms in high-tech industries, locate research in just the South.",2019,Business & Economics
Intellectual Property and Consolidation in the Seed Industry,; ,"Intellectual property protections on seeds have increased dramatically in recent decades, from the granting of patent-like protections on certain types of seeds in 1970 to the enforcement of contract provisions for seeds beyond the first sale in 2013. During this same period, the seed industry has experienced rapid consolidation. Although as recently as the 1970s, it was characterized by thousands of small, mostly family-owned business, by 2011, just three agrochemical firms controlled more than half of the global proprietary seed market. These trends have resulted in rapidly increasing prices for commodity seeds and reduced farmers' ability to save seeds. Given these important negative impacts, why do these trends continue? Expanding intellectual property protections and reducing the number of competitors are strategies that the largest firms understandably employ to increase their power but government support has also been essential to their success. Policy changes have reduced the enforcement of antitrust laws and increased the enforcement of alleged intellectual property infringements. In addition, synergies between stronger intellectual property protections and consolidation have further reinforced the dominance of top firms at the expense of a freely competitive industry. A better understanding of these trends is unlikely to reverse them in the near term but may increase the effectiveness of creating alternatives to a seed oligopoly.",2015,Agriculture

Groundwater is also used for agricultural irrigation and for the domestic supply of drinking water in most nations. However, groundwater contamination has led to many research efforts on groundwater remediation technologies and strategies. This study evaluated a total of 5486 groundwater remediation-related publications from 1995 to 2015 using bibliometric technology and social network analysis, to provide a quantitative analysis and a global view on the current research trend and future research directions. Our results underline a strong research interest and an urgent need to remediate groundwater pollution due to the increasing number of both groundwater contamination and remediation publications. In the past two decades, the United States (U.S.) published 41.1% of the papers and it was the core country of the international collaboration network, cooperating with the other 19 most productive countries. Besides the active international collaboration, the funding agencies also played positive roles to foster the science and technology publications. With respect to the analysis of the distribution of funding agencies, the National Science Foundation of China sponsored most of the groundwater remediation research. We also identified the most productive journals, Environmental Science and Technology and Journal of Contaminant Hydrology, which published 334 and 259 scientific articles (including research articles and reviews) over the past 20 years, respectively. In addition to journal publications, a patent analysis was performed to show the impact of intellectual property protection on journal publications. Three major remediation technologies, including chemical oxidation, biodegradation and adsorption, have received increasing interest in both journal publication and patent development. Our results provide a valuable reference and global overview to identify the potential obstacles and opportunities for researchers who currently work on groundwater contamination, remediation and related topics.

Global Access to Maize Germplasm Provided by the US National Plant Germplasm System and by US Plant Breeders,; GENETIC-RESOURCES; DENT CORN; GREEN-REVOLUTION; DIVERSITY; IMPROVEMENT; PROTECTION; INBREDS,"Access to high-yielding germplasm increases agricultural productivity. Plant Variety Protection (PVP) is the most globally used form of Intellectual Property Protection. Commercially available varieties protected solely by PVP can be accessed for further breeding within the country or region of protection. Unlike the practice in most other countries, the USDA has a policy of providing parental inbred lines of hybrids into the public domain following expiration of their protection by PVP. Parental lines and varieties protected by utility patents are also available in the public domain following expiration of protection. These distributions represent fresh opportunities for researchers, hybrid seed producers and plant breeders, nationally and internationally. As a contribution to the continuing debate over ownership and access to plant germplasm we report distributions of maize (Zea mays L.) by the US National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS). During 1988-2015 the NPGS distributed 251,926 packets to 7,582 requestors, fulfilling 10,432 orders. Distributions were primarily to US entities (87%), with 32,520 (13%) to a total of 79 foreign countries. Of the total NPGS maize distributions reported here, 45,968 (18%) were expired or off-PVP germplasm. We hope that access provided to this germplasm will act as a reminder that the primary benefit of the Multilateral System under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) is indeed that of having facilitated global access to germplasm and that this concept will remain an important guiding principle during further implementation of the Treaty.",2016,Agriculture
Experimental Investigations on the Basis for Intellectual Property Rights,intellectual property; copyright; patent; plagiarism; creative commons; DISREGARD INADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE; CHILDRENS RESPONSE; PIRACY; LAW; COPYCAT; NORMS,"Lay people routinely misunderstand or do not obey laws protecting intellectual property (IP), leading to a variety of (largely unsuccessful) efforts by policymakers, IP owners, and researchers to change those beliefs and behaviors. The current work tests a new approach, inquiring whether lay people's views about IP protection can be modified by arguments concerning the basis for IP rights. Across 2 experiments, 572 adults (recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk) read 1 of 6 arguments about the basis for IP protection (incentives, natural rights, expressive rights, plagiarism, commons, or no argument). Participants then reported their general support for IP protection. Participants also reported their evaluations of 2 scenarios that involved infringement of IP rights, including cases in which there were mitigating experiences (e.g., the copier acknowledged the original source), and completed several demographic questions. Three primary findings emerged: (a) exposure to the importance of the public commons (and to a lesser extent, exposure to the argument that plagiarism is the basis of IP protection) led participants to become less supportive of IP protection than the incentives, natural rights, expressive rights, and control conditions; (b) people believed that infringement was more acceptable if the infringer acknowledged the original creator of the work; and (c) older adults and women were especially likely to see infringement as problematic. These findings illustrate several ways in which lay beliefs are at odds with legal doctrine, and suggest that people's views about IP protection can be shaped in certain ways by learning the basis for IP rights.",2016,Government & Law; Psychology
Protection of the Spectr-R Spacecraft Against ESD Effects Using Satellite-MIEM Computer Code,Electrostatic discharges (ESDs); lumped-element model (LEM); protection; spacecraft (SC) Spektr-R; ,"There are two competing tendencies in spacecraft (SC) design and manufacturing. On the one hand, it is a never-ceasing upgrading of the SC electronics to lower energy consumption and increase its functionality, which in turn makes it more susceptible to electrostatic discharges (ESDs). On the other hand, designers constantly seek to improve electronics protection against ESDs. Spectr-R SC features on-board equipment, which is highly sensitive to possible ESDs. To exclude ESD-related failures, the following protection measures have been taken. Based on the Satellite-MIEM computer code, we developed the lumped-element model of the Spectr-R body currents and cable-affected electronic response. This model made it possible to compute SC body currents initiated by ESDs originating at various structural sites. For various cable harnesses, we measured transformation coefficients converting body currents into the amplitude of the noise voltages appearing in a cable (a patented methodology was used for this purpose). Afterward, these transformation coefficients together with the ESD-induced currents have been fed into the Satellite-MIEM software to compute noise voltages appearing in electronic input circuits, connected via these cables to the satellite exterior surface. Comparing protection efficiency of cables and electronic equipment allowed us to select suitable cable harnesses and the appropriate equipment protection to insure reliable in-flight performance of the space vehicle. From the launch in July 2011 and up to the present time, there were no failures of the Spectr-R electronics, which could be traced to ESDs.",2015,Physics
Environmental technology: Fluidised-bed steam dryers - latest developments and practical experience,fluidised-bed steam dryer; product inlet; distribution plate; plug protection system; rotary weir; ,"Fluidised-bed steam dryers have been in use for industrial scale drying of pressed beet pulp for more than 20 years. This highly energy-efficient process can be considered to be state of the art in the industry. Scientific laboratory and pilot-plant testing have provided the basis for a detailed description of the principles of fluidisation and drying in superheated water vapour. Advances in production data acquisition, in particular regarding the options for the real-time presentation and evaluation of high-resolution operating data (Industry 4.0), have opened up new potentials for optimisation of the drying process in fluidised-bed steam dryers. By analysing and interpreting sequences of events, or simultaneous events, it is now possible to analyse process behaviour in great depth. This allows malfunctions to be avoided by improved design or, assisted by suitable measuring and control systems, to be detected at an early stage. Failures can then be prevented altogether by initiating automated countermeasures. On the basis of more recent insights gained from the analysis of faults and disruptions using modern operating data acquisition, BMA's fluidised-bed steam dryer (WVT) has been subjected to fundamental technological and technical improvements, so it now meets today's demands for efficiency and reliability.

Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory qualitative study was performed using semi-structured interviews with chief executive officers and innovation managers of 22 industrial firms and institutions from the machine-tool industry. Findings - Key forms of knowledge must be shared by the two agents. Producers have to obtain in-depth knowledge about customers' needs and customers need knowledge on producer's absorptive capacity. Producers distinguish between three types of customers: reference customers, necessary for innovations with greatest scope, clientes amigos or test users, required to test innovations currently being developed, and traditional customers, associated with incremental innovations. The traditional means of protecting innovations is a detailed contract between customer and supplier; and patents are used for innovations of greater technological scope, as a form of defense against third-party patents and as a signaling element of absorptive capacity. Originality/value - The paper draws on the direct experience of executives from companies whose innovation is based on a close relationship with customers to answer questions to which the literature has yet to provide definitive answers: What sort of information to be shared is relevant for the generation of innovations? Are all customers equal or are there profiles that contribute more effectively to the development of innovations?

Severity of symptoms and prognosis for recovery are variable. We transected the RLN unilaterally in an infant mammalian animal model to characterize the degree and variability of dysphagia in a controlled experimental setting. We tested the hypotheses that (1) both airway protection and esophageal function would be compromised by lesion, (2) given our design, variability between multiple post-lesion trials would be minimal, and (3) variability among individuals would be minimal. Individuals' swallowing performance was assessed pre- and post-lesion using high speed VFSS. Aspiration was assessed using the Infant Mammalian Penetration-Aspiration Scale (IMPAS). Esophageal function was assessed using two measures devised for this study. Our results indicate that RLN lesion leads to increased frequency of aspiration, and increased esophageal dysfunction, with significant variation in these basic patterns at all levels. On average, aspiration worsened with time post-lesion. Within a single feeding sequence, the distribution of unsafe swallows varied. Individuals changed post-lesion either by increasing average IMPAS score, or by increasing variation in IMPAS score. Unilateral RLN transection resulted in dysphagia with both compromised airway protection and esophageal function. Despite consistent, experimentally controlled injury, significant variation in response to lesion remained. Aspiration following RLN lesion was due to more than unilateral vocal fold paralysis. We suggest that neurological variation underlies this pattern.",2015,Otorhinolaryngology

It contributes to a better understanding of the emergence and development of the system by utilizing three levels of analysis: the institutional framework of the system, the market dynamics of production and deployment, and the composition of innovation-related activities. The analysis demonstrates the interrelated roles of transnational factors, local government policies, and research and development (R&D) activities undertaken by the main actors in shaping the system dynamics. Tracking the relative position of China in the global PV manufacturing, installation and technological development, the analysis shows a gap between the growth of China's market share and its modest share of transnational patent applications. This suggests a puzzle, which the paper attempts to answer by inspecting the individual companies in the system against four aspects. First, the dynamic development of their size and performance. Second, the nature of their international involvement through foreign direct investment and mergers and acquisition deals. Third, their technological specialization within the PV value chain over time. Fourth, the spatial scope of their patenting protection endeavours. The analysis recognises four periods of system development driven jointly by market dynamics and government plans. Behind the continuous growth of the system, there were different driving and moderating factors in each period.",2019,Business & Economics

Though countries around the world are increasingly interested in using tax incentives and other policy initiatives to address this underinvestment problem, there is little empirical evidence comparing the effectiveness of alternative domestic policies and institutions at spurring R&D. Using data from a broad sample of OECD economies, we find that financial market rules that improve accounting standards and strengthen contract enforcement share a significant positive relation with R&D in more innovative industries, as do stronger legal protections for intellectual property. In contrast, stronger creditor rights and more generous R&D tax credits have a negative differential relation with R&D in more innovative industries. These results suggest that domestic policies directly dealing with appropriability and financing problems may be more effective than traditional tax subsides at promoting the innovative investments that drive economic growth.

It firstly seeks to define the boundaries of oceans and human health research. We use three case studies as examples: biomedical research, marine litter and human well-being. Biomedical research raises complex issues relating to coastal states' sovereign rights to exploit their marine resources and the patenting processes. Coastal states have differing degrees of control over research at sea. There are differences in EU and US law over the status of genetic discoveries, with the US having stricter criteria to qualify for patent protection. International law sets the standard for bioprospecting in developing countries under the Nagoya Protocol. The cost and complexity of marine biomedical research mean that it cannot be left to commercial exploration and needs some public funding. The second case study highlights the rise in marine plastics pollution using Marine Conservation Society beachwatch data. It details the need to alter product design to avoid marine pollution and records an unsuccessful attempt by academics and an NGO to make contact with the manufacturers of one polluting product.

HOW DOES THE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AFFECT HI-TECH EXPORTS FROM THE MOST ADVANCED ECONOMIES?,intellectual property rights; development; international trade; threat of imitation; FOREIGN PATENT RIGHTS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; US EXPORTS,"The aim of the paper is to find the relationship between the threat of the imitation of intellectual property (IP) and the exports of high-tech commodities from the five advanced economies (G-5: Germany, France, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States) during 1970-2010. Theoretical models do not explain clearly the impact of the stronger protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) on trade. Thus, more empirical research in this area is needed. The results show that the threat of imitation is an important factor influencing exports from the most advanced economies to all countries of the world. In the case of high and upper middle-income importers, the stronger threat of imitation (resulting from low IP protection and strong imitation abilities) results in increased exports from the five advanced economies, especially in the case of high tech goods. Regarding low and lower middle-income importers, when the threat of imitation rises, the exports, especially of non-high-tech goods from the G-5 economies, decreases.",2018,Business & Economics
Protecting knowledge: How legal requirements to reveal information affect the importance of secrecy,Secrecy; Information disclosure; Knowledge visibility; Technological clusters; Innovation performance; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTERORGANIZATIONAL IMITATION; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; DISCLOSURE; PATENTS; SEARCH; FIRMS; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; COMPLEMENTARITY,"Most firms use secrecy to protect their knowledge from potential imitators. However, the theoretical foundations for secrecy have not been well explored. We extend knowledge protection literature and propose theoretical mechanisms explaining how information visibility influences the importance of secrecy as a knowledge protection instrument. Building on mechanisms from information economics and signaling theory, we postulate that secrecy is more important for protecting knowledge for firms that have legal requirements to reveal information to shareholders. Furthermore, we argue that this effect is contingent on the location in a technological cluster, on a firm's investment in fixed assets and on a firm's past innovation performance. We test our hypotheses using a representative sample of 683 firms in Germany between 2005 and 2013. Our results support the moderation effect of a technological cluster and a firm's investment in fixed assets. Our findings inform both academics and managers on how firms balance information disclosure requirements with the use of secrecy as a knowledge protection instrument.",2018,Business & Economics
Reverse technology transfer from the East to the West: Evidence from R&D sites of Western multinationals in China,Technology transfer; International business; Reverse technology transfer; INNOVATION; PROTECTION,"Purpose The approach of Western companies to internationalise their R&D by establishing R&D sites in emerging markets (EMs) has led to a discussion about the role of R&D in home markets and host markets. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the evolution of foreign R&D sites of Western companies in EMs and their role using China as the empirical context. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the State Intellectual Property Office database, and investigates about 2,000 patent families of the top 14 Western patent applicants in China. Findings The results indicate a gradual shift from an exploitative to an exploratory role of R&D sites in China. The study also shows evident learning effects on Western R&D from local counterparts. Research limitations/implications The paper motivates further research of R&D internationalisation approaches within EMs, and explores the changing role of local subsidiaries. While the study is only focussed on China, the applicability of the results is limited in context of other countries, due to cultural, economic and legislative differences. Practical implications This study shows the increasing importance of EMs such as China and how these markets, known for imitations and cheap resources, are gradually moving towards innovations and creating new technologies locally. Originality/value Based on the patent analysis, this study shows the growing importance of the local R&D subsidiaries of Western multinationals in China.",2018,Business & Economics

In this study, we further assessed the Plasmodium falciparum antigen upregulated in infective sporozoites 3 (PfUIS3)as a vaccine candidate. PfUIS3 was expressed in the viral vectors chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and used to immunize mice in a prime-boost regimen. We previously demonstrated that this regimen could provide partial protection against challenge with chimeric P. berghei parasites expressing PfUIS3. We now show that ChAd63-MVA PfUIS3 can also provide partial cross-species protection against challenge with wild-type P. berghei parasites. We also show that PfUIS3-specific cellular memory responses could be recalled in human volunteers exposed to P. falciparum parasites in a controlled human malaria infection study. When ChAd63-MVA PfUIS3 was coadministered with the vaccine candidate P. falciparum thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (PfTRAP) expressed in the ChAd63-MVA system, there was no significant change in immunogenicity to either vaccine. However, when mice were challenged with double chimeric P. berghei-P. falciparum parasites expressing both PfUIS3 and PfTRAP, vaccine efficacy was improved to 100% sterile protection. This synergistic effect was evident only when the two vaccines were mixed and administered at the same site. We have therefore demonstrated that vaccination with PfUIS3 can induce a consistent delay in patent parasitemia across mouse strains and against chimeric parasites expressing PfUIS3 as well as wild-type P. berghei; when this vaccine is combined with another partially protective regimen (ChAd63-MVA PfTRAP), complete protection is induced.",2017,Immunology; Infectious Diseases

The issue has been extensively studied in general, but there is no previous research on the effects that an international strengthening of legal protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) due to the Uruguay Round Agreement and the Annex on Trade-Related aspects of the IPR (TRIPs, for short), underwritten in 1994, may have had on worldwide emissions, as a result of the discovery of new or more efficient air pollution abatement technologies. Different econometric models are used to give a quantitative measure of the TRIPs agreement to reduce air pollution. In particular, the impact of the TRIPs is addressed using a dummy variable and the index of Ginarte and Park (Ginarte, Park 1997) that is one of the more commonly used indicators of TRIPs enforcement employed in economic literature. The findings of this research partially support the idea that the strengthening of a uniform minimum standard protection level of IPR, among the member countries of the World Trade Organization, may help to reduce air pollution emissions.",2017,Business & Economics
Impaired antimicrobial response and mucosal protection induced by ibuprofen in the immature human intestine,; PATENT DUCTUS-ARTERIOSUS; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; GENE-EXPRESSION; INDOMETHACIN; DRUGS; PERFORATION,"BACKGROUND: The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as indomethacin (INDO) and ibuprofen (IBU) has been shown to be an effective therapy for the closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). However, this treatment has been associated with an increased risk of developing enteropathies in neonates. Whether the use of IBU is safer than INDO for the immature intestine remains to be elucidated. METHODS: The direct impact of IBU on the human immature intestinal transcriptome was investigated using serum-free organ culture. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software and compared with those previously reported with INDO. Validation of differentially expressed genes was confirmed by qPCR. RESULTS: We identified several biological processes that were significantly modulated by IBU at similar levels to what had previously been observed with INDO, while the expression of genes involved in antimicrobial response and mucus production was significantly decreased exclusively by IBU in the immature intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that IBU has a harmful influence on the immature intestine. In addition to exerting many of the INDO observed deleterious effects, IBU alters pathways regulating microbial colonization and intestinal epithelial defense.",2018,Pediatrics

DN cardioplegia has been used for pediatric cardiac surgery but its use in complex reoperative surgery has not been studied. We specifically report the outcomes of patients undergoing reoperative cardiac surgery after previous coronary artery bypass grafting with a patent internal mammary artery (IMA). Methods: Patients undergoing reoperative cardiac surgery with prior coronary bypass grafting surgery were studied between 2010 and 2013. Fourteen patients were identified who required continued retrograde cardioplegia administration. In all cases, an initial antegrade dose was given, followed by continuous retrograde administration. Demographics, co-morbidities, intra-operative variables including cardioplegia volumes, post-operative complications, and patient outcomes were collected. Results: The mean age of all patients was 73.3+/-6.7 years, and 93 % were male. Aortic cross clamp time and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 81+/-35 and 151+/-79 mins, respectively. Antegrade, retrograde and total cardioplegia doses were 1101+/-398, 3096+/-3185 and 4367+/-3751 ml, respectively. An average of 0.93+/-0.92 inotropes and 1.50+/-0.76 pressors were used on ICU admission after surgery. ICU and total hospital lengths of stay were 5.5+/-7.4 and 9.6+/-8.0 days, respectively. Complications occurred in two patients (14 %) (pneumonia and prolonged mechanical ventilation) and new arrhythmias occurred in five patients (36 %) (four new-onset atrial fibrillation and one pulseless electrical activity requiring 2 min of chest compression). No perioperative myocardial infarctions were noted based on electrocardiograms and cardiac serum markers. Postoperatively, left ventricular function was preserved in all patients whereas two patients (14 %) had mild decrease in right ventricular function as assessed by echocardiography. No mortality was observed. Conclusion: Del Nido cardioplegia solution provides acceptable myocardial protection for cardiac surgery that requires continuous retrograde cardioplegia administration. DN cardioplegia's administration in a continuous retrograde fashion with a patent IMA is believed to provide adequate myocardial protection while avoiding injuring the IMA through dissection and clamping.",2015,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Surgery

We explore how a country's information environment affects innovation, an activity characterized by high information asymmetries and potentially severe proprietary costs. Studying both long-run cross-country differences in the availability of firm-specific information to corporate outsiders, as well as quasi-experimental shocks to the information environment following transparency-enhancing security market reforms, we document significantly higher rates of R&D and patenting in richer information environments. The effects of transparency are strongest in industries that rely on external equity rather than bank debt, indicating that transparency facilitates innovation by reducing the information costs associated with arm's-length financing. In contrast, transparency has no impact on physical capital accumulation, consistent with fewer information asymmetries in tangible assets. An economy's information environment has important but heterogeneous effects on the nature and extent of real economic activity.",2019,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science

To analyze this question, we develop a monetary hybrid endogenous growth model in which R&D and capital accumulation are both engines of long-run economic growth. We find that monetary expansion hurts economic growth and social welfare by reducing R&D and capital accumulation. Furthermore, a larger market power of firms strengthens these growth and welfare effects of monetary policy through the R&D channel but weakens these effects through the capital-accumulation channel. Therefore, whether the market power of firms amplifies or mitigates the welfare cost of inflation depends on the relative importance of the two growth engines. Finally, we calibrate the model using data in the United States and the Euro Area to quantitatively evaluate and compare the welfare cost of inflation in these two economies and find that the R&D channel dominates in both economies.",2019,Business & Economics
Competition policies for water environment technology imports in China,Water environment; Technology importing; Competition policies; Green exemption; ,"This paper analyzes the current state of water environment protections in China and explores the need for technology imports in this field. Few studies have discussed the import of water environment technologies in China. In particular, there is a lack of research on the competition policies of technology-importing countries. Based on the retrieval and analysis of technology patents in the water environment field, as well as the research on relevant competition policies, this paper indicates that China shall import and learn about related technologies from developed countries, such as the US and the EU. In addition, China ought to pay more attention to relevant EU competition policies. The relationship between water environment protections and EU market competition policies could serve as a reference for green exemption practices in Chinese anti-trust law. Lastly, this paper analyzes China's relevant competition policy.

This article explores the consequences of the UK's withdrawal from the EU for intellectual property (IP) law and policy. Compared with other fields such as Economic and Monetary Union and the development of the EU's 'social chapter', the UK has been a supportive and proactive player in internal market integration, particularly pertaining to IP protection. As a result of 'Brexit', the EU may find that the impetus for further harmonization and integration in this field is lost, such as with the EU unitary patent. However, the consequences for the UK are likely to be more severe - a loss of influence, both over laws that govern it and in exporting IP norms internationally, as well as a loss of access to certain protections, agencies and market sectors that are within the UK's economic interests.",2017,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law

This paper studies whether domestic environmental policies affect the inward technology transfer of cleaner innovation from abroad. We focus specifically on the power sector, for its important role in the decarbonization process, by looking at zero-carbon (renewable) and carbon-saving (efficient fossil) technologies for energy production. Using data on cross-country patent applications, we provide evidence that environmental policy contributes to attracting foreign cleaner technology options to OECD markets but not to non-OECD markets. We show that this is due to the nature of the implemented policy instruments. Market-based approaches positively impact technology transfer to both OECD and non-OECD economies, while non-market based approaches have at best only a weak effect in OECD countries. Domestic environmental policies may provide too weak a signal for foreign innovators in countries off the technological frontier. This calls for a strengthening of policy incentives for technology transfer in light of pressing climate change objectives.",2017,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

To solve the problems of vibration isolation of marine diesel power plants in the framework of development and improvement of the shock absorption system, the original patented elastic supports with elastic elements made of steel wire rope in the form of a torus are presented. When commercially available vibration isolators do not meet the relevant requirements of vibration protection of a particular object, the solution to the existing problem can be achieved by using the proposed wire rope vibration isolators. The technical results of the original patented inventions are: equal stiffness in the horizontal plane ensuring the reliability and high vibration efficiency of protection against impacts and shocks. The proposed designs of vibration isolators are easy (technological in manufacturing) to manufacture and assemble, reliable and durable - the service life is 10 years or more. Vibration efficiency is confirmed by the vibration acceleration spectra before and after the vibration isolator of the damping system of the ship diesel-generator GA-500 and the diesel unit with a 2H 8.5/11 engine and water brake on a common sub-frame.

On the surface, such activity seems benign and perhaps even salutary. Nonetheless, antitrust litigation has revealed that firms sometimes modify existing drugs not because new formulations would demonstrably improve health outcomes, but principally because so-called secondary patents covering the new version of the drug enable them to maintain some effective market power over the active ingredient for which original, primary patent protection has expired. This product hopping strategy runs counter to the goal of the legislative framework for regulating branded and generic drug approvals, which is to create appropriate incentives for discoveries that elevate the quality of patient care and human health by providing a period of reward for the brand followed by timely and effectual generic entry. In this Article, I explain that the rules and institutions involved in determining the validity of patents on chemical inventions, certain features of drug regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and unique market forces in the pharmaceutical sector combine to allow strategic product hopping. To address this problem, I propose a novel regulatory scheme that would empower the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to induce pharmaceutical companies to generate comparative data indicative of therapeutic distinctiveness between related forms of small-molecule drugs. I explain that the FDA is institutionally well-positioned to serve as an information intermediary that can help increase transparency with respect to drug changes, and show that the relevant disclosures can be presented in a manner that is useful to patients, prescribers, and payers. The proposed framework would then enable these market participants to identify and reject strategic drug product changes, reducing the manufacturer's incentive to pursue such modifications. Ultimately, the FDA's new authority for comparative data development could lead to improvements in patient care and promote downstream clinical research based on scientific evidence gathered under the directives of the proposed scheme.",2019,Government & Law
Does intellectual property lead to economic growth? Insights from a novel IP dataset,economic development; growth; index; intellectual property; international comparison; PATENT PROTECTION; RIGHTS; IMPACT; INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS; TECHNOLOGY; SEARCH; TRADE,"While policymakers often make bold claims as to the positive impact of intellectual property (IP) rights on both developed and developing country economies, the empirical literature is more ambiguous. IP rights have both incentive and inhibitory effects that are difficult to isolate in the abstract and are dependent on economic context. To unravel these contradictory effects, this article introduces an index that evaluates the strength of IP protection in 124 developing countries for the years 1995 to 2011. We illustrate the value of this index to economics study and show evidence that is consistent with IP leading to increased growth. Our results are further consistent with two causal pathways highlighted in the literature: that IP leads to greater levels of technology transfer and increased domestic inventive activity. Yet other aspects of our study fit uneasily with this simple story. For example, we find evidence suggesting that increased levels of growth lead to greater levels of IP protection, contradictory evidence in the literature linking IP with growth, a lack of evidence that increased levels of IP protection lead to actual use of the IP system, and problems with what IP indexes measure. Because of this, we suggest another - and so far undertheorized - explanation of the links between IP and growth: that IP may have few direct effects on growth and that any causality is a result of belief rather than actual deployment of IP.",2019,Government & Law; Public Administration

Employment growth heterogeneity under varying intellectual property rights regimes in European transition economies: Young vs. mature innovators,Employment growth; Intellectual property rights; Innovative youngsters; Transition economies; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; FIRM GROWTH; GIBRATS LAW; SIZE; BEHAVIOR; AGE,"Young innovative companies are supposed to be key drivers of sustainable economic growth. This study examines the employment growth of young, small innovative firms (denoted as innovative youngsters) and contrasts it with the employment growth of established 'mature innovators' in 23 European transition economies, where varying degrees of intellectual property protection apply. The growth figures of the two firm groups vary significantly across different intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes. Innovative youngsters seem to benefit from strong intellectual property protection, while mature innovators exhibit the highest employment growth rates when IPRs are rather weak. These findings point to important undiscovered differences in employment growth patterns, which might explain some of the ambiguous results of former research on IPRs, and provide a reason why certain countries might benefit from strong IPRs while others might not.

Drawing on the appropriability literature, we argue that the inclusion of a grantback clause in technology licensing agreements is an attempt to balance the gains from and protection of the focal firms' technologies. We hypothesize that the closer the licensed technology is to the licensor's core patented technologies, the more likely the licensing agreement will include a grant-back clause, while the closer the licensed technology is to the licensee's core patent portfolio, the less likely the agreement will include a grant-back clause. We hypothesize also that technological uncertainty is a positive moderator in the decision to include a grant-back clause, if the licensed technology is close to either the licensee's or the licensor's core technologies. We employ a hierarchical nested decision model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 397 licensed technologies. This method allows us to model the choice to include a grant-back clause as nested in the decision about which technologies to license out. We find broad support for our theoretical arguments.",2017,Business & Economics

Adaptive monitoring, assessment, and management programs will be required to reduce the environmental hazards of pharmaceuticals of concern. Potentially underappreciated factors that drive the environmental dose of pharmaceuticals include regulatory approvals, marketing campaigns, pharmaceutical subsidies and reimbursement schemes, and societal acceptance. Sales data for 5 common antidepressants (duloxetine [Cymbalta], escitalopram [Lexapro], venlafaxine [Effexor], bupropion [Wellbutrin], and sertraline [Zoloft]) in the United States from 2004 to 2008 were modeled to explore how environmental hazards in aquatic ecosystems changed after patents were obtained or expired. Therapeutic hazard ratios for Effexor and Lexapro did not exceed 1; however, the therapeutic hazard ratio for Zoloft declined whereas the therapeutic hazard ratio for Cymbalta increased as a function of patent protection and sale patterns. These changes in therapeutic hazard ratios highlight the importance of considering current and future drivers of pharmaceutical use when prioritizing pharmaceuticals for water quality monitoring programs. When urban systems receiving discharges of environmental contaminants are examined, water quality efforts should identify, prioritize, and select target analytes presently in commerce for effluent monitoring and surveillance.

Probiotics possibly stimulates the growth of preferred microorganisms, crowds out potentially harmful microorganisms, and reinforces the body's natural defense mechanisms. Microencapsulation of probiotic microorganisms protects them from the destructive environment and prolongs their survival. Use of mucoadhesive and pH responsive polymers could impart extended retention, pH sensitive release and mucoadhesive properties to the system. The probiotic formulations could be used for therapeutic, diagnostic, and prophylactic purposes. Areas covered: Layer-by-layer techology was developed for encapsulating Bacillus coagulans employing chitosan and alginate as mucoadhesive polymers (for attachment to the gastrointestinal mucosa) and Eudragit EPO and Eudragit L100 as pH responsive polymers (for site-specific delivery). The formulation was evaluated for layer stability, mucoadhesion capability, protection of microorganisms from biological insults, pH responsive layer removal, in vitro evaluation in three-dimensional intestinal tissue model, probiotic bacterial delivery. Expert opinion: In this patent, a unique layer-by-layer assembly of two differently charged polymers (mucoadhesive and pH repsonsive) was achieved for encapsulating the probiotic microorganism. For assessing the clinical applicability of the invention, further studies may be needed since the conclusions are drawn solely based on in vitro data.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
HEALTH CARE'S GRAND CHALLENGE: STIMULATING BASIC SCIENCE ON DISEASES THAT PRIMARILY AFFLICT THE POOR,; INNOVATION; MARKET,"Perhaps the most compelling Grand Challenge in health care is addressing diseases that primarily afflict the poor. Policies and practices conceived in high-income countries for improving the lives of patients in low-income countries have been criticized as ineffective or harmful. We examine the impact of one such policy, the World Trade Organization's 1994 Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which was partly justified by a claim that patents and other intellectual property protections would improve the availability of drugs for neglected diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. There is little evidence associating TRIPS with clinical trials, patents, or trade-in drugs for these diseases. One explanation for this is that basic science is required as a prerequisite to drug development. We theorize, test for, and find evidence that TRIPS encouraged the time-consuming and complex development of managerial institutions required for basic science on neglected diseases. The results indicate an increase in basic science on neglected diseases and in applied science on nonneglected diseases as countries became TRIPS compliant. In newly TRIPS-compliant, low-income countries, scientists intensified basic research on locally relevant diseases. We call for the application of management theories to grand challenges, and to the evaluation of policies such as TRIPS.",2016,Business & Economics

Research objectives were i) to identify and validate heterotic groups and patterns, and ii) to determine if ex-PVP lines are useful for continued genetic progress in short-season environments. Three groups of crosses were made following North Carolina Mating Design II (NCII) including 12 NDSU, 24 ex-PVP lines, and seven current industry testers. Hybrids were planted in four different experiments at six ND environments following partially balanced lattice experimental designs in 2011 and 2012. Top heterotic patterns were selected based upon grain yield and other agronomic traits. Our research indicates most ex-PVP lines are genetically narrow and may not be immediately useful. Less protection (5-yr vs. 20-yr) might increase usefulness of ex-PVP lines. This change in intellectual property will allow public breeders to develop better versions of industry lines carrying known weaknesses.",2016,Agriculture; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

Content Analysis and Basic Evaluation of the Third Revised Version of China's Provisions for Drug Registration,drug registration; CRDA; traditional Chinese medicine; patent linkage; ,"China's Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) published three revised versions of Provisions for Drug Registration from 2014 to 2017. The Third Revised Version of Provisions for Drug Registration was promulgated recently and approaches maturity. On the one hand, the Third Revised Version of Provisions for Drug Registration enhances the authority of CFDA; sets requirements for types of drug registrations, clinical drug trial authenticity, drug registration application review, and drug registration standards; and strengthens both drug intellectual property protection and drug experimental data protection, resulting in a reduction in the pass rate for drug registration applications. On the other hand, The Third Revised Version of Provisions for Drug Registration relaxes restrictions on drug registration applicant qualifications and on the use of overseas experimental data, introduces priority review and approval regulations, allows drug advance marketing authorizations (with conditions), and approves drug extended therapy. Under it, in the future, more attention will be paid to new drugs and drug quality in China's drug registration application.",2018,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

Technology licensing enables licensees to access proven technologies without development delays, although licensors might deny licenses for strategic reasons. Results show that firms with own R&D are more likely to license foreign technologies, as are larger firms and firms in the nations' main business cities. However, the macroeconomic and institutional environment matters as well: domestic interest rates, informal sector competition, and the literacy of a country's labor force all impact foreign technology licensing.

COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE USE OF NEW STURGEON MIGRATION MONITORING SYSTEMS ON THE LOWER DANUBE,monitoring systems; receiver stations; sturgeons; ultrasonic transmitters; BEHAVIOR; FISH,"The hydrotechnical works (bottom sills, banks protections, and guiding wall) performed during 2011 -2017 period on the Danube river, between Calarasi and Braila (km 375-175), aimed to improve the fluvial navigation, and have imposed a continuous monitoring of biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The aim of these hydraulic works is to identify the possible negative effects which might appear and find the alternative solutions to eliminate the risks. The sturgeons, which are migratory species protected by Romanian law and closely monitored by international organizations, can be affected by these works, in the sense that the newly constructed bottom sills would prevent the migration to the breeding habitats. For the migration monitoring, ultrasonic receiver stations and ultrasonic transmitters developed by the Vemco Canada Company were used.

Based on a dataset comprising 170 R&D subsidiaries (classified by 57 parent companies and 23 host countries) it is shown that a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship exists between external host knowledge sourcing and innovative performance. In terms of the moderating effects, the findings reveal that the influence of alternative sources of knowledge affects the aforementioned relationship in a negative way. Finally, a stronger IPR protection regime in the host location weakens, rather than strengthens the relationship between the external host knowledge sourcing and innovative performance.",2018,Business & Economics

Focusing on the differential effects of stronger IPR on industries, we suggest four causal paths from IPR through R&D to economic performance. Using firm-level panel data in semiconductor, pharmaceutical and shipbuilding industries in Korea, we find that effective causal paths vary not only by industry but by firm size. Stronger IPR are beneficial to R&D-intensive industries where large domestic firms have strong R&D and IPR capabilities, but have no impact on globalized industries. On the other hand, stronger IPR are detrimental to industries and to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) characterized by limited resources. Thus, to boost innovation and economic growth, IPR policies need to be customized to industries as well as SMEs. Universally strong IPR policies are likely to discourage innovation and growth, causing some industries to suffer.",2015,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration

We report our strategy and outcomes, especially those of spinal cord protection.MethodsOutcomes of 178 patients (age: 26-88years) who underwent thoracoabdominal aortic replacement were retrospectively analyzed. 65 had aortic dissection, 14 had infected aneurysms, and 22 presented with rupture. Operations were non-elective in 24 and redo through re-thoracotomy in 21. Extent of replacement was Crawford-I in 39, II in 26, III in 78, and IV in 35. Staged repair was recently preferred, which resulted in decrease in extent II repair and increase in redo since 2009. Operations were performed under distal aortic perfusion and multi-segmental sequential repair to maximize collateral blood flow, and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was preserved for those requiring open aortic anastomosis (n=20). A total of 166 separate grafts were used for intercostal reconstruction in 88 patients, which was guided by preoperative feeding artery localization. Their patency was studied by postoperative MD-CT in 74 patients for 145 grafts.ResultsThere were 3.9% hospital mortality and 5.1% spinal cord injury. Preoperative feeding artery localization resulted in reduced number of reconstruction and improved patency, and grafts connecting to the feeding artery were patent in 92%. Results of redo operations were not different (no mortality and spinal cord injury) from the de novo operations.ConclusionsOur concept of spinal cord protection, which was based on selective intercostal reconstruction while maximizing spinal cord collateral blood flow, seems justified.",2019,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Surgery

Recent work has shown that intraoral transport and swallow kinematics change following RLN lesion, suggesting potential changes in bolus formation prior to the swallow. In this study, we used geometric morphometrics to understand the effect of bolus shape on penetration and aspiration in infants with and without RLN lesion. We hypothesized (1) that geometric bolus properties are related to airway protection outcomes and (2) that in infants with RLN lesion, the relationship between geometric bolus properties and dysphagia is changed. In five infant pigs, dysphagia in 188 swallows was assessed using the Infant Mammalian Penetration-Aspiration Scale (IMPAS). Using images from high-speed VFSS, bolus shape, bolus area, and tongue outline were quantified digitally. Bolus shape was analyzed using elliptical Fourier analysis, and tongue outline using polynomial curve fitting. Despite large inter-individual differences, significant within individual effects of bolus shape and bolus area on airway protection exist. The relationship between penetration-aspiration score and both bolus area and shape changed post lesion. Tongue shape differed between pre- and post-lesion swallows, and between swallows with different IMPAS scores. Bolus shape and area affect airway protection outcomes. RLN lesion changes that relationship, indicating that proper bolus formation and control by the tongue require intact laryngeal sensation. The impact of RLN lesion on dysphagia is pervasive.",2017,Otorhinolaryngology
MUSIC AS A MATTER OF LAW,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT; PROTECTION; PATENT; RULES,"What is a musical work? Philosophers debate it, but for judges the answer has long been simple: music means melody. Though few recognize it today, that answer goes all the way back to the birth of music copyright litigation in the nineteenth century. Courts adopted the era's dominant aesthetic view identifying melody as the site of originality and, consequently, the litmus test for similarity. Surprisingly, music's single-element test has persisted as an anomaly within the modern copyright system, where multiple features of eligible subject matter typically are eligible for protection. Yet things are now changing. Recent judicial decisions are beginning to break down the old definitional wall around melody, looking elsewhere within the work to find protected expression. Many have called this increasing scope problematic. This Article agrees but not for the reason that most people think. The problem is not, as is commonly alleged, that these decisions are unfaithful to bedrock copyright doctrine. A closer inspection reveals that, if anything, they are in fact more faithful than their predecessors. The problem is instead that the bedrock doctrine itself is flawed. Copyright law, unlike patent law, has never shown any interest in trying to increase the predictability of its infringement test, leaving second comers to speculate as to what might or might not be allowed. But the history of music copyright offers a valuable look at a path not taken, an accidental experiment where predictability was unwittingly achieved by consistently emphasizing a single element out of a multi-element work. As a factual matter, the notion that melody is the primary locus of music's value is a fiction. As a policy matter, however, that fiction has turned out to be useful. While its original, culturally myopic rationale should be discarded, music's unidimensional test still offers underappreciated advantages over the everything counts analysis that the rest of the copyright system long ago chose.",2018,Government & Law

Mechanistic framework predicts drug-class specific utility of antiretrovirals for HIV prophylaxis,; IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1; STEADY-STATE PHARMACOKINETICS; PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; PROTEIN-BINDING; VIRAL LOAD; IN-VIVO; INTRACELLULAR CONCENTRATIONS; HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION; PLUS RITONAVIR; INFECTION,"Currently, there is no effective vaccine to halt HIV transmission. However, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the drug combination Truvada can substantially decrease HIV transmission in individuals at risk. Despite its benefits, Truvada-based PrEP is expensive and needs to be taken once-daily, which often leads to inadequate adherence and incomplete protection. These deficits may be overcome by next-generation PrEP regimen, including currently investigated long-acting formulations, or patent-expired drugs. However, poor translatability of animal-and ex vivo/in vitro experiments, and the necessity to conduct long-term (several years) human trials involving considerable sample sizes (N>1000 individuals) are major obstacles to rationalize drug-candidate selection. We developed a prophylaxis modelling tool that mechanistically considers the mode-of-action of all available drugs. We used the tool to screen antivirals for their prophylactic utility and identify lower bound effective concentrations that can guide dose selection in PrEP trials. While in vitro measurable drug potency usually guides PrEP trial design, we found that it may over-predict PrEP potency for all drug classes except reverse transcriptase inhibitors. While most drugs displayed graded concentration-prophylaxis profiles, protease inhibitors tended to switch between none-and complete protection. While several treatment-approved drugs could be ruled out as PrEP candidates based on lack-of-prophylactic efficacy, darunavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine and rilpivirine could more potently prevent infection than existing PrEP regimen (Truvada). Notably, some drugs from this candidate set are patent-expired and currently neglected for PrEP repurposing. A next step is to further trim this candidate set by ruling out compounds with ominous safety profiles, to assess different administration schemes in silico and to test the remaining candidates in human trials.",2019,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Mathematical & Computational Biology

In contrast to most of the literature that focuses on the performance of female managers/owners, this paper addresses conduct with regard to innovation. Results show that female owners, rather than female managers, were more likely to introduce innovations. Further, R&D performing firms introduced innovations, as did larger and older firms. The presence of an informal sector and finance availability constraints actually spurred innovation introductions, with economic prosperity leading to complacency in innovation introductions.",2019,Engineering; Business & Economics

Novel High-Power Nonresonant Multichannel LED Driver,High-power light-emitting diode (LED) lighting; multichannel LED driver; nonresonant converter; quadrupler rectifier; DESIGN,This paper reports a multichannel high-power light-emitting diode (LED) driver employing a single-stage dc-dc power conversion and control technique with dimming capability. A half-bridge nonresonant converter with symmetrical quadrupler rectifier output is implemented to convert available dc power to multiple current regulated dc outputs for driving LED loads. The dc-dc power conversion efficiency of about 98% is obtained from advantageous operation of the converter with complete soft switching of all semiconductor devices and reduction in power conversion stages. The driver possesses inherent protection against LED failures due to its topology for both electrically open and short-circuit conditions of the LEDs. This patented converter is applicable for high-power LED lighting.,2017,Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation
Quantification of technological progress in greenhouse gas (GHG) capture and mitigation using patent data,; CARBON CAPTURE; FUNCTIONAL-APPROACH; COMBINED-CYCLE; DESIGN,"Greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic sources are believed to be the main cause of global warming and climate change. Furthermore, fossil fuels are forecasted to remain the dominant source of energy in the near future. Therefore, capture and sequestration of greenhouse gases and in particular carbon dioxide is likely to be a major pathway toward environmental protection and energy sustainability. Such clarity has stimulated an intense and diverse range of research into various capture and mitigation technologies, which race with global warming in real-time. Quantification of the performance improvement rates of these technologies can inform decision-makers' long-term investment strategies, and help researchers to identify technical bottlenecks and research potential. The present research estimates the yearly performance improvement rate of CO2 capture, non-CO2 GHG capture, and GHG mitigation technologies, using a novel method based on patent data and the corresponding citation network. Our findings suggest that membrane-based, condensation/rectification-based, and adsorption-based carbon capture are the most promising technologies. Furthermore, the average CO2 capture technologies are likely to improve slightly faster than solar, wind, and battery technologies, indicating their important role in future electrical grids. Unfortunately, subterranean or submarine CO2 storage was identified as a slow-growing technological domain and potentially a bottleneck in the future sustainable carbon chain, which requires further efforts.",2019,Chemistry; Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
The impact of Medicare part D prescription drug benefit program on generic drug prescription A study in long-term care facilities,difference-in-difference analysis; generic drug; Medicare Part D; medication prescription; FEATURES,"To examine whether the Medicare Part D program had an impact on the generic drug prescription rate among residents in long-term care facilities. We analyzed prescription data for 3 drug classes (atypical antipsychotic, proton pump inhibitor, and statin) obtained from a regional online pharmacy serving long-term care centers in Pennsylvania from January 2004 to December 2007. Difference-in-difference is used as a primary analysis method, and different regression methods (probit and multinomial) are used to accommodate different types of outcome measures. Contrary to expectations, the Part D program did not have a statistically significant impact on the generic prescription rate in the long-term care setting during the study period. Only the statin class showed a dramatic increase in generic drug prescriptions, mainly due to the loss of patent protection for one of the most popular brand-name drugs in the class. The complex dynamics of the prescription drug market, particularly the availability of generic versions of popular prescription medications, had a bigger role in increasing the prescription rate of generic drugs than the Part D program. This warrants the need to relax prescription medicines' patent policies and for further study on the impact of such policies.",2019,General & Internal Medicine

Lost cost savings to the NHS in England due to the delayed entry of multiple generic low-dose transdermal buprenorphine: a case scenario analysis,buprenorphine; patent; evergreening; budget impact; utilisation; CHRONIC PAIN; DRUGS; UK,"Objective Originator pharmaceutical companies prolonging the patent of a medicine prevents rivals' entry to the market and competition. As the entry of generic alternatives usually results in price reduction, any delay in their entry potentially deprives the National Health Service (NHS) of much-needed savings. This study estimates the potential cost savings lost to the NHS as a result of delayed entry of generic low-dose buprenorphine (LDTB) patches in England. Design Two case scenarios were modelled to determine the savings from the entry of generic LDTB Butec only between February and August 2016 and the potential savings which could have been achieved if all generic LDTB patches had entered the market at the same time. Setting The volume of utilisation of branded and generic LDTB in UK primary care was derived from the NHS business services authority website for prescriptions dispensed between February 2015 and January 2018. Main outcome measures Cost savings associated with the entry of generic LDTB. Results The cumulative cost savings from the introduction of Butec alone was 0.7 ($0.92) million. The model predicted that if all generic buprenorphine entered the market at the same time with Butec, they could have been achieved a 1.2 pound ($1.57) million saving. This means that approximately 0.5 pound ($0.65) million savings was lost to the NHS over the 6-month time period. Conclusions The entry of Butec was associated with cost savings. We estimated that more cost savings could have been achieved if other generic LDTB patches had entered the market at the same time to drive competition between rivals. Patent protection strategies which delayed the entry of multiple generics were responsible for the reduced cost savings to the NHS in England.",2019,General & Internal Medicine

The paper develops a structural model of demand and supply using data on price, sales, and the characteristics of statins in Denmark and simulates outcomes under a complete ban of parallel imports, keeping other regulatory schemes unchanged. There are two sets of key results. The first set focuses on price effects. On average, prices increase more in markets where the molecule has lost patent protection; wholesale prices for both generic and original products increase after competition from parallel importers is removed, but the final price paid by consumers (after deducting reimbursement) increases more for original products than for generics because most changes in wholesale prices are absorbed by the prevailing reimbursement rules. The second set of results reports the effects on market participants. My model takes into consideration consumers' preferences, allowing them to substitute between products. Prohibiting parallel imports induces consumers to substitute towards original products for which they have stronger preferences. In sum, banning parallel imports leads to (a) an increase in variable profits for original producers and a decrease for generic firms, (b) an increase in governmental health-care expenditures, and (c) a decrease in the welfare of Danish patients and firms.",2018,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services

To establish a more rigorous animal model, we acquired African woodland thicket rats of the genus Grammomys, the natural hosts for Plasmodium berghei. Thicket rats were acquired and identified as Grammomys surdaster by skull and teeth measurements and mitochondrial DNA genotyping. Herein, we demonstrate that thicket rats are highly susceptible to infection by P. berghei, and moderately susceptible to Plasmodium yoelii and Plasmodium chabaudi: 1-2 infected mosquito bites or 25-100 sporozoites administered by intravenous injection consistently resulted in patent parasitemia with P. berghei, and resulted in patent parasitemia with P. yoelii and P. chabaudi strains for at least 50% of animals. We then assessed efficacy of whole-organism vaccines to induce sterile immunity, and compared the thicket rat model to conventional mouse models. Using P. berghei ANKA radiation-attenuated sporozoites, and P. berghei ANKA and P. yoelii chemoprophylaxis vaccination approaches, we found that standard doses of vaccine sufficient to protect laboratory mice for a long duration against malaria challenge, are insufficient to protect thicket rats, which require higher doses of vaccine to achieve even short-term sterile immunity. Thicket rats may offer a more stringent and pertinent model for evaluating whole-organism vaccines.",2017,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Tropical Medicine"

PATENT PROTECTION FOR A METHOD OF RATOON RICE MANAGEMENT IN SUPPORTING FOOD SECURITY,food security; patent; management; Ratoon's rice; method; ,"Pursuant to Article 25 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1945) that: Everyone has the right to a standard of living, adequate health and well-being of himself and his family including the right for food. Essentially food security can be described as a phenomenon relating to individual food security which exists when all people at all the times have physical , social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. However, since 2009 the food security situation has worsened and continuous to pose a serious threat especially in the developing nations. The internationally agreed target from the World Food Summit of 1996 to halve hunger by 2015 was not met. Despite progress in some countries, United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)'s estimates in 1997-1999 there 865 million people were undernourished, 777 million in developing countries, 27 million in transition countries and 11 million in the industrialized countries. Even if the target is met, it would still leave 400 million people under nourished. The fact that in the year 2017 there was 19, 4 million Indonesian people who did not meet their required food needs. Pursuant to Article 33 paragraph 3 of the 1945 Constitution (UUD1945) stated that: The earth, the water and all the wealth contained therein are controlled by the State and used as much as possible for the welfare of the people. Production branches that are important and affect the livelihood of many people controlled by the State shall be used for the greatest prosperity of the people.

Of especial concern was the protection of intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry. Two cases from 2013 were selected: FTC v. Activis (loosely characterized as pay for delay) and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. (loosely characterized as can you patent genes?). Part of the rationale for the selection was the importance of the Supreme Court rulings and the importance of the pharmaceutical sector. A qualitative content analysis of the Court's reported decision in each case was analyzed. Since ethical considerations may or may not be consistent with efficiency considerations of plaintiffs, defendants, or the courts, both efficiency and ethical arguments were included. Equally important to the understanding of the economic and ethical issues in the two above- mentioned cases was the development of a rationale for including and excluding a variety of ethical theories, ultimately influenced by Markkula Center For Applied Ethics Of Santa Clara University and Schumann (Hum Resour Manag Rev 11(1):93-111, 2001). The refinement and use of a levels analysis approach portrays societal, organizational, and individual impacts, and allows for deeper understanding of litigated cases, irrespective of the country in which the litigation takes place (van Oosterhout et al., J Bus Ethics 55(4):385-393, 2004; Foss et al., J Manag Stud 47(3):455-482, 2010).

However, this is not always good for the market. The damages for IP infringement increased drastically in China in recent years. This has drawn our attention to the application of the Chinese IP laws. This article analysed the rules in Chinese patent, trademark and copyright laws and their application by Chinese courts regarding damages adjudication with most updated legislative documents, statistics, important cases as well as the judicial policies of the Chinese Supreme Court. The article found that, driven by judicial policy, the courts used significant discretion to achieve increase of damages unjustifiably. This is a double edged sword for the market because, though favourable to IPR owners, it is harmful to the rule of law and it makes IP enforcement a business to misappropriate licit profit of infringer, especially in view of the emerging IP trolls. China should carry out reform to improve the legal regime of damages for IP infringement. The solution to these problems lies in resorting to the strict application of compensatory damages.",2019,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law

Based on an international survey of 415 manufacturing firms, we investigate how the use of different kinds of intellectual property protection mechanisms (IPPMs) affects interfirm R&D collaboration while considering partner location in the analysis as well. Our results show that the use of formal, semi-formal or informal IPPMs has different effects on openness in terms of partner variety and depth of collaboration with academic partners, value chain partners and competitors. Moreover, when considering location we uncover previously hidden appropriability-openness liaisons showing that semi-formal or informal IPPMs are mainly valid in relation to national partners, whereas formal appropriability explains international collaborations. One implication of the study is that to better understand the appropriability-openness relationship it is imperative to differentiate between national and international settings. We further suggest that the potential paradox delineating this relationship has a geographical dimension.",2016,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
The IP Strategic Dealer,; ,"Firms defined as IP Strategic Dealers are the most adept at working with IP, using best practice or being at an advanced stage approaching best practice. These are internationally oriented, innovative firms that are continuously challenged both by other IP Strategic Dealers encroaching on their market position and by infringement of their IP rights. The IP Strategic Dealer has a formalized IP strategy as an integrated part of the firm's strategy, and commonly employs a dedicated IP manager. IP Strategic Dealers tend to have formalized their IP processes, many to the point where IP is integrated into the stage-gate models the firms use in product development. As a part of the formalized process, the IP Strategic Dealer has a systematic learning process, where experiences are retained and invoked into new routines. The IP Strategic Dealer employs multiple layers of protection, using several patents, trade secrets, trademarks, design rights and/or copyrights to protect firm assets. This provides the IP Strategic Dealer with a synergetic effect that increases the levels of protection. Not all Strategic Dealers are at the most advanced level, however all are strongly committed to using IP as a central part of their firm's strategy and continuously learn and develop their competencies in working with IP.",2015,Government & Law
Market trends and statistics for the agrochemical and biological sectors within agriculture,Agrochemical; crop protection; non-crop; R&D; generics; growth; forecast; technology; ,"In the last two years the agrochemical industry has suffered a downturn in value terms, principally as a result of low crop prices and weaker farm economics affecting the crop protection sector. The noncrop agrochemical market, which is more driven by the general economy, has been more resilient. This article investigates the trends in market development by product sector, geographical region and key country. A key driver in the industry is innovation. Data is presented to show the rise in the cost of bringing a new active ingredient to the market, which along with increasing regulatory demands has resulted in slowdown in the number of new products being introduced and also entering development. A consequence of this is a greater market share for off-patent chemistry. An analysis of the breakdown and trends in the generic agrochemical market is presented. The article concludes with a forecast for future market growth, which is expected to be in line with the steady performance between 2006 and 2010, not the rapid expansion seen between 2011 and 2013 when crop prices were at record levels.",2017,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Chemistry
"Interactions Between Science, Technology and Society: An Introduction",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS; PATENTS; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; FREEDOM,"This introductory chapter aims to explore and understand the way particular scientific and technological developments affect legal values and institutions and how such phenomena can influence scientific and technological regulations. Scientific discoveries and technological innovations are in fact at the root of the progress made in many areas (in the field of information and telecommunications, agriculture, health, education, environment, etc.). Scientific research and technological innovations are also crucial factors in implementing changes in society and in the economy (See generally Cutcliffe SH, Ideas, machines and values: an introduction to science, technology and social studies, 2000). In particular, advances in fields like medicine, biology, chemistry, information technology, and telecommunications have wrought a Copernican revolution into our daily lives. These are fascinating subjects, but they also have many ethical, legal and social implications. In the following pages, we will firstly clarify essential theoretical and practical concepts for interpreting and understanding the aspects of the investigation. Then, using some practical and illustrative examples, we will try to explain some of the most challenging issues at the intersection of law, science and technology. In particular, we will illustrate the deep interrelation between science, technology and legal protection of individual rights.",2016,Government & Law

Ironically, during the 19th century the United States was not a leading IPR advocate as it is today, but was a leading IPR violator. Developing an institution-based view of IPR history, we identify three underlying theoretical mechanisms that help to explain IPR in the two countries - path dependence, long-term processes, and institutional transitions. We argue that both the US refusal to protect foreign IPR in the 19th century and the current Chinese lack of enthusiasm to meet US IPR demands embody rational responses to their respective situations. However, given long-term processes with intensifying isomorphic pressures, institutional transitions in favor of better IPR protection are quite possible. Finally, going above and beyond these two countries, we draw on the IPR history in over ten other countries to develop a more globally generalizable framework, which in turn contributes to the key question of how history matters.",2017,Business & Economics

Most of these contain obligations on the protection and enforcement of IP that set significantly higher standards than those of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), commonly referred to as 'TRIPS-plus'. Human rights bodies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and academic commentators often criticise these standards for undermining flexibilities available under TRIPS. Such policy space, however, is critical to design national IP laws in accordance with domestic needs. This chapter makes a case for the continued relevance of the TRIPS Agreement as an overarching, multilateral framework. My argument is based on the role treaty law affords to the object and purpose expressed in Articles 7 and 8 TRIPS. They have not only been recognised as essential for promoting access to medicines in the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. As integral objectives and principles of TRIPS, Articles 7 and 8 limit the ability of World Trade Organization (WTO) Members to modify their IP-related treaty obligations inter se. Based on their negotiation history and common understandings expressed by WTO Members, I argue for an enhanced role of TRIPS' object and purpose as a loose constitutional frame for IP commitments in bilateral and regional treaties.",2018,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Designing acorn protection for direct seeding of quercus species in high predation areas,sowing; underplanting; trial-and-error; seed protector; afforestation; oak; OAK QUERCUS; FORESTS; SPAIN; L.,"Aim of the study: a) To present the trial-and-error approach followed in the design and patent of a manufactured seed and seedling protector effective against mice and voles, rabbits, wild boar and deer (http://bopiweb.com/elemento/829172/). b) To assess the viability of direct oak seeding with and without protection in the complex acorn predation reality of post fire restoration and underplanting in existing pine afforestations. Study area: Northern Plateau of Spain, in an area of extreme acorn predation. Material and methods: We followed a classical trial-and-error approach for problem solving. Different modifications to a wire mesh screen cylinder were tested in subsequent trials aiming to evaluate the effects on acorn predation and early emerging plant survival and growth. The final protector is based on a thin wire mesh cylinder with three innovations: a truncated cone, a circular crown and a sphere compartment. Further we assessed the viability of direct oak seeding with and without protection in the complex acorn predation reality of post fire restoration and underplanting in existing pine afforestations. Main results: The manufactured seed protector was found to be effective against synergic attacks of mice, rodents, wild boars and herbivores. Survival of protected oak was 77% under canopies and 32% in open light conditions two years after sowing. Research highlights: Our results confirm the viability of direct oak seeding for woodland restoration if seed predation is controlled.",2015,Forestry
Institutional complementarities between labour laws and innovation,; EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION LEGISLATION; WRONGFUL-DISCHARGE LAWS; MARKET; FLEXIBILITY; PROPERTY; COSTS,"We analyse how institutional complementarities between employee representation laws and dismissal restrictions influence aggregate innovation outcomes. We argue that greater employee voice, due to improved employee representation legislations, may spur innovative effort by employees only when shareholders cannot renegotiate ex-ante agreements with workers over revenue sharing, by threatening dismissal. We perform a panel regression analysis, exploiting country-sector panel data over the 1977-2005 period, and find that stronger employee representation laws in the presence of stricter firing restrictions are in fact associated with higher patenting activity. Consistently with our theoretical argument, the magnitude of this empirical relationship is seen to be relatively larger in those sectors where the human capital contribution to production is higher. Implications for the analysis of economic institutions and for legal policy making are proposed.",2019,Business & Economics

It describes how Samsung and other companies advertised in the Eastern District of Texas a patent litigation hot spot to curry favor with the people who live there, including by sponsoring an ice rink located directly outside the courthouse. To be sure, image advertisements are constitutionally protected speech and might even warrant the highest level of protection under the First Amendment when they are not purely commercial in nature. Still, the Article argues, courts should be able to prohibit such advertisements altogether, or at the very least limit their impact through voir dire and discovery, because they threaten the right to an impartial jury guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment.",2019,Government & Law
The Postcolonial Time That Remains,"Australian colonization; Agamben, Giorgio; postcolonial law; social transformation; discontinuity; postcolonial temporality; Indigenous sovereignty; ","Sovereign authority to establish the colony of South Australia was given by Letters Patent (1836), signed by King William IV. The Letters Patent made explicit provision for the recognition and protection of Indigenous rights and interests in traditional lands and waters, establishing the basis for a peaceable and respectful interaction between Indigenous and settler societies. However, the preexisting sovereignty of Indigenous peoples was not respected and these written orders were ignored by the South Australian Company in its executive action to establish the Province of South Australia. Accordingly, the potential for development of positive forms of intercultural social relationship remained unrealized in this region, as was also the case throughout the Australian colonies. This essay reflects upon the transformative force of this unrealized potential, which remains immanent within the trajectory of Australian history. It makes use of Agamben's conceptualization of time and exigency in The Time That Remains (2005) to theorize directed processes of historical discontinuity. We analyse colonial sources of contemporary Australian society, with a renewed attention to those aspects of political recognition and positively shared social life that were always possible but never came to pass into history. We argue that the experience of time and temporality in the 'messianic mode' enables new understanding of the problematic 'time of the now' and recreates possibilities for the communal invention of postcolonial futures that respond properly to ongoing and contemporary Indigenous practices of sovereignty and nationhood.",2015,Cultural Studies; History
Biosimilars: How Can Payers Get Long-Term Savings?,; GENERIC COMPETITION; MARKETS,"The term 'biosimilar' refers to an alternative similar version of an off-patent innovative originator biotechnology product (the 'reference product'). Several biosimilars have been approved in Europe, and a number of top-selling biological medicines have lost, or will lose, patent protection over the next 5 years. We look at the experience in Europe so far. The USA has finally implemented a regulatory route for biosimilar approval. We recommend that European and US governments and payers take a strategic approach to get value for money from the use of biosimilars by (1) supporting and incentivising generation of high-quality comprehensive outcomes data on the effectiveness and safety of biosimilars and originator products; and (2) ensuring that incentives are in place for budget holders to benefit from price competition. This may create greater willingness on the part of budget holders and clinicians to use biosimilar and originator products with comparable outcomes interchangeably, and may drive down prices. Other options, such as direct price cuts for originator products or substitution rules without outcomes data, are likely to discourage biosimilar entry. With such approaches, governments may achieve a one-off cut in originator prices but may put at risk the creation of a more competitive market that would, in time, produce much greater savings. It was the creation of competitive markets for chemical generic drugs-notably, in the USA, the UK and Germany-rather than price control, that enabled payers to achieve the high discounts now taken for granted.",2016,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Effective drug delivery to the eye is a challenging proposition for the pharmaceutical scientist. Eye drops have been globally accepted as a formulation for anterior segment applications. On one hand it is widely used owing to its convenience but is also associated with some limitations in terms of desired pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile, dosing frequency, systemic untoward effects, patient noncompliance, low drug bioavailability due to transient contact time, rapid washout by tearing and nasolacrimal drainage. The need to overcome these major issues related to ocular pharmacotherapy has been long recognized. Several novel nanocarriers including nanolipid based carrier systems have been widely explored and investigated for ophthalmic applications. These include solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), liposomes, in situ gels, niosomes, mucoadhesive systems and discomes. Since lipids have similar structure to human cell lipids, their biodegradable, non-toxic and biocompatible profile are particularly useful. Additionally, they also offer protection against drug degradation, impart controlled drug release characteristics and site specific delivery. This review explores the potential feasibility of lipid component in formulation of nanomedicine for ophthalmic delivery and reports the clinical findings in order to improve the ocular pharmacotherapy. Here, we also discussed for patents related to the topic.",2015,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics

These new drugs, numbering about 200, are now losing patent protection and imitators are entering the market of comparable drugs, called biosimilars. According to a popular belief, these producers of biosimilars (erroneously called copycats) are everywhere, except in the United States. In North America, on both sides of the US border, the increase in the number of biosimilar producers is evident. In addition, although the US federal government tries to erect barriers against the entry of foreign-made biosimilars in the country, many states are lobbying the federal government and allowing the use of biosimilars. And biosimilars represent a very convenient ladder for emergent and industrial countries to learn the enigmatic routines of the pharmaceutical industry.

Decentralized Production: The Need for Social Norms-Based Intellectual Property?,Engineering; information technology; innovation; inventions; social norms; OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; RIGHTS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; ECONOMY; PATENTS; BENEFIT; VIEW,"The objective of this paper is to explore the need for and possible benefits of social norms-based intellectual property systems in the context of the renaissance of decentralized production. Innovative engineering in addition to powerful information and communications technology enables a renaissance of decentralized production. A central form of such is co-engaging production. This renaissance can already be observed in small-scale 3D printing, microbreweries, small-scale food production in rooftop greenhouses, and small-scale electricity generation with solar panels installed by users of electricity. Individuals engaging in decentralized production typically have limited resources, which may hinder them from applying registration for industrial property rights. Therefore, social norms-based intellectual property can, in some cases, be more cost efficient in the case of decentralized production. In the case of cross-border groups, social norms-based intellectual property can evolve regardless of territorially restricted national legal-based intellectual property rights. The advantages of social norms may override their disadvantages when no great economic interests are involved and the production and the need of protection are short-term by nature. The decentralized characteristic of social norms-based intellectual property brings in new people as creators of creations for which intellectual property protections exist. This can enhance creativity by broadening the cognitive and cultural diversity of the creations. Social norms-based and legal norms-based intellectual property systems are not mutually exclusive and can exist side-by-side.",2019,Business & Economics

It was found that the grooves on the blank fiber were covered by Al2O3, accordingly decreasing the surface defects. In this case, the coating effectively improved the breaking strength of the quartz fiber at elevated temperatures. The coated fiber still exhibited relatively higher strength of 0.38 N/tex after annealing at 600 degrees C for 60 min, nearly three times as that of the blank fiber. Both the formation mechanism and the protection mechanism of the Al2O3 coating were systematically investigated.

Patents and Logocentric Differences: Protecting the Competitive Advantage,; ,"The discussion progressed in this chapter is about the protection of organizational knowledge in competitive environments. Knowledge can leak in the value creation networks embedded in knowledge-intensive firms, and a collaborative approach can be utilized to minimize risk and increase sustainability. For knowledge to be preserved from unintentional outflow, its confidential nature and description must be understood at all levels. Loss of knowledge can occur at any point; whether it is through the process of consultation or when employees do their work. Forfeiture of information can be unintended or a planned effort. To prevent such unintended leakage, it is important to develop a shared mindset among employees to minimize the risk. The socio-technical system is a philosophical framework that enables companies to simultaneously consider both ethical and technical systems in order to best match the technology and the people involved. In this paper we show how the socio-technical system can be applied to prevent knowledge leakage.",2017,Business & Economics

Innovation and imitation as an interactive process,Imitation innovation; Lotka-Volterra system; intellectual property; dynamic uncertainty; real option; DYNAMIC COMPETITION ANALYSIS; LOTKA-VOLTERRA EQUATIONS; PATENT LIFE; DIFFUSION; MARKET; OPTIONS; POLICY,"This article deals with the problem of the coexistence of innovators and imitators in a competitive market. The study proposes a model of innovation and diffusion of productive knowledge as an interactive process between innovators and imitators under conditions of dynamic uncertainty. The process can be modelled as a Stackelberg game, where the innovator acts as a leader in choosing whether to share knowledge or set up private protection and the imitator as a follower in choosing when becoming active. Under these conditions, activation thresholds are derived for both innovators and imitators. If protection policies are effective, the imitator can be trapped into an inaction region by the innovator. Thus, there will be two regimes without and with diffusion, according to whether the inaction region is enacted or not. Under these conditions, discovery and diffusion appear to be dynamic complements, as a higher speed of activation of innovating firms is favoured by a higher level of imitation and a higher speed of activation of imitating firms is favoured by a higher level of discoveries. In order to explore some of the quantitative implications of these results, the paper also proposes an application of the model to four European countries.",2016,Business & Economics

Because funding across governments might be positively correlated due to unobserved drivers they have in common, we use variation in the representation of research-intensive universities on US Congressional appropriations committees as an instrument for US funding. We find that a 10 % increase in US government funding for a disease is associated with a 2 to 3 % reduction in funding for that disease by another government in the following year.",2017,Business & Economics

Technological and non-technological innovation and productivity in services vis-a-vis manufacturing sectors,Innovation; productivity; services; manufacturing; innovation surveys; Latin America; ,"In this paper, the links between investment in innovation activities, innovation outputs (technological and non-technological innovation) and productivity in services vis-a-vis the manufacturing sector are explored using innovation survey data from Uruguay. The size of firms, their cooperation in R&D activities, the use of public financial support, patent protection and the use of market sources of information are very important drivers of the decision to invest in innovation activities across sectors. The main determinants of technological and non-technological innovations are the level of investment in innovation activities and the size of the firm. The results indicate that both technological and non-technological innovations are positively associated to productivity gains in services, but non-technological innovations have a more important role. The reverse happens for manufacturing, where technological innovations are more relevant for productivity.",2016,Business & Economics
Business Conflict and Risk Regulation: Understanding the Influence of the Pesticide Industry,; POLITICS; PROTECTION,"Despite the criticism, frequent in the literature, of business influence on the formulation of pesticide risk regulation, there has been remarkably little systematic study of this practice. This article discusses Costa Rica pesticide producers' business influence on global and national efforts to improve risk regulation. Generic pesticide producers, selling off-patent chemicals, contest the views of traditional, research-based pesticide companies, which demand stricter application of global regulatory guidelines. These business sectors use different forms of power (as identified in neo-Gramscian theory) for bending regulation to their advantage. The argument developed here builds on neo-pluralist business conflict theory for explaining shifts in environmental governance. It challenges a recently made argument that business conflict increases the state's ability to issue more restrictive environmental regulation. Instead, to truly understand the outcomes of business conflict-environmental governance interactions and the implementation of global environmental standards, researchers should analyze the structural heterogeneity within states.",2017,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations; Government & Law

Increasing drug resistance of the parasite and insecticide resistance of mosquitoes necessitate alternative control measures. Numerous vaccine candidates have been identified but none have been able to induce robust, long-lived protection when evaluated in malaria endemic regions. Rodent studies have demonstrated that chemically attenuated blood stage parasites can persist at sub-patent levels and induce homologous and heterologous protection against malaria. Parasite-specific cellular responses were detected, with protection dependent on CD4+ T cells. To investigate this vaccine approach for Plasmodium falciparum, we characterised the persistence and immunogenicity of chemically attenuated P. falciparum FVO strain parasites (CAPs) in non-splenectomised Aotus nancymaae monkeys following administration of a single dose. Control monkeys received either normal red blood cells or wild-type parasites followed by drug treatment. Chemical attenuation was performed using tafuramycin A, which irreversibly binds to DNA. CAPs were detected in the peripheral blood for up to 2 days following inoculation as determined by thick blood smears, and for up to 8 days as determined by quantitative PCR. Parasite specific IgG was not detected in monkeys that received CAPs; however, in vitro parasite-specific T cell proliferation was observed. Following challenge, the CAP monkeys developed an infection; however, one CAP monkey and the infection and drug-cure monkeys showed partial or complete resistance. These experiments lay the groundwork for further assessment of CAPs as a potential vaccine against malaria. (C) 2016 Australian Society for Parasitology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"MACHINES AS THE NEW OOMPA-LOOMPAS: TRADE SECRECY, THE CLOUD, MACHINE LEARNING, AND AUTOMATION",; COPYRIGHT; LAW; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; PATENT; PROTECTION; CONTRACT; STANDARD; HISTORY; FUTURE,"In previous work, I wrote about how trade secrecy drives the plot of Roald Dahl's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, explaining how the Oompa-Loompas are the ideal solution to Willy Wonka's competitive problems. Since publishing that piece I have been struck by the proliferating Oompa-Loompas in contemporary life: computing machines filled with software and fed on data. These computers, software, and data might not look like Oompa-Loompas, but they function as Wonka's tribe does: holding their secrets tightly and internally for the businesses for which these machines are deployed. Computing machines were not always such effective secret-keeping Oompa Loompas. As this Article describes, at least three recent shifts in the computing industry-cloud computing, the increasing primacy of data and machine learning, and automation-have turned these machines into the new Oompa-Loompas. While new technologies enabled this shift, trade secret law has played an important role here as well. Like other intellectual property rights, trade secret law has a body of built-in limitations to ensure that the incentives offered by the law's protection do not become so great that they harm follow-on innovation-new innovation that builds on existing innovation-and competition. This Article argues that, in light of the technological shifts in computing, the incentives that trade secret law currently provides to develop these contemporary Oompa-Loompas are excessive in relation to their worrisome effects on follow-on innovation and competition by others. These technological shifts allow businesses to circumvent trade secret law's central limitations, thereby overfortifying trade secrecy protection. The Article then addresses how trade secret law might be changed- by removing or diminishing its protection-to restore balance for the good of both competition and innovation.",2019,Government & Law

The new method implements an invented Disinfectant (WSD) for decontamination of rearing surfaces, and a developed drinking water-herbal coccidiostat (EOBWE) supplement. The experimental design has 8 treatments (TRTs), with four pens/TRT, and 25 broiler chicks/pen. The floors of TRT1 to TRT7 are contaminated with 4.0 x 10(5) sporulated oocysts/m(2) of each of E. acervulina, E. maxima, and E. tenella, while TRT8-floor is left uncontaminated. The floors of TRTs 1 and 2 are disinfected with chlorine, while that of TRTs 3-6 are disinfected by WSD. Floors of TRTs 7 and 8 are deprived of disinfection. Birds in TRTs 1, 6, 7, and 8 are deprived of coccidiostat, while birds in TRTs 2 and 3 are fed salinomycin in their feed; birds of TRT 4 are administered EOBWE in drinking water, while birds of TRT 5 are administered simultameously both, the salinomycin and EOBWE. Birds in TRT 4 (WSD/EOBWE treated) and TRT 5 (WSD/salinomycin + EOBWE) had improved protection (lowest oocyst output and intestinal lesions) and enhanced production (lowest mortality, lowest feed conversion ratio, and highest live body weight) compared to the other five challenged treatments, associated with significant improvements compared to positive controls (TRT 7) (P < 0.05).",2019,Agriculture
Development of a Novel Magnetic Brake Shoe for Mine Hoists Based on Nano-Fe3O4 and Nd-Fe-B Additive,Brake material; magnetic powder; friction and wear; properties; magnetism; preparation; formula optimization; formula design; TRIBOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE,"Background: The brake is an important safety protection device for mine hoists, in which the performance of the brake shoe affects directly the safe operation of the hoist system. In order to solve problems such as high wear rate and unstable friction coefficient of brake shoe under high temperature, this paper indicated that adding magnetic powder to the composite material of traditional mine hoist's brake shoe will be a creative and effective approach to improve its properties. Methods: Based on relevant China patents of the authors, several new formulas of brake shoe material were designed in the presence of Nano-Fe3O4 and Nd-Fe-B, and the methods of both preparation and performance testing of the magnetic brake shoes were introduced. The experiment of formula design was carried out by uniform prescription design, and the friction coefficient and wear rate of each kind of brake shoes made through different formulas were measured. Furthermore, the formula was optimized by application of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and analytic hierarchy process. Results: Compared with ordinary formulas, the optimized formula is higher totally and changes more steadily as well. Its wear rate is far lower than the national standard. Namely, its comprehensive properties are better. Few relevant patents to the topic have been reviewed and cited. Conclusion: This paper proved that it is practically valuable and feasible to improve the properties of hoist brake shoes by adding magnetic powder to its composite material.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics
"A method of reproducing complex, multi-object anatomical structures",Rapid prototyping; Medical; Tests and testing; Casting; FINITE-ELEMENT MODEL; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; CORTICAL BONE,"Purpose - This paper aims to present a method of reproducing multi-object structures from materials of diverse physical properties with the use of models fabricated by means of rapid prototyping (RP) techniques. Design/methodology/approach - A process of modelling complex anatomical structures of soft tissues and bones using mandible models as examples was described. The study is based on data acquired through standard computed tomography. Physical models of examined objects were fabricated with RP technology from a 3D-CAD virtual model. Findings - In the analysis of complex medical issues, beside numerical methods, one can simultaneously make use of experimental tests to verify obtained results. In the case of experimental tests, it is necessary to fabricate physical models with appropriate material properties. RP techniques used in the method ensure accurate reproduction of the external shape of the fabricated model, whereas consecutive stages allow us to construct moulds and create internal structures within a finished model by wax cast models. Practical implications - The application of a physical RP model makes the identification of medical problem more efficient and the reconstruction of pathological alterations for experimental tests clearer. It prevents the simplification of assumptions to experimental analysis. The approach may reduce costs of fabricating models for experimental studies and offers the possibility of using materials of desired properties. Originality/value - The approach developed by the authors and presented in this paper was submitted for patent protection as A Method of Reconstructing Medical Models with Internal Structure and the Use of Materials of Diverse properties - patent application no.

When Collaboration Bridges Institutions: The Impact of University-Industry Collaboration on Academic Productivity,university-industry collaboration; division of labor; scientific productivity; innovation; interorganizational relationships; simultaneous discoveries; knowledge production; PUBLIC RESEARCH; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; LIFE; SCIENTISTS; ECONOMICS; NETWORKS; COMMERCIALIZATION,"Prior research suggests that academic scientists who collaborate with firms may experience lower publication rates in their collaborative lines of work because of industry's insistence on intellectual property protection through patenting or secrecy. In contrast, we posit that university-industry collaboration can sometimes foster specialization and boost academic contribution to open science. Specifically, research lines with both scientific and commercial potential (i.e., in Pasteur's quadrant) provide an opportunity for a productive division of tasks between academic scientists and their industry counterparts, whereby the former focus on exploiting the scientific opportunities and the latter focus on the commercial ones. The main empirical challenge of examining this proposition is that research projects that involve industry collaborators may be qualitatively different from those that do not. To address this issue, we exploit the occurrence of simultaneous discoveries where multiple scientists make roughly the same discovery around the same time. Following a simultaneous discovery, we compare the follow-on research output of academic scientists who collaborated with industry on the discovery with that of academic scientists who did not. We find that academic scientists with industry collaborators produced more follow-on publications and fewer follow-on patents than did academic scientists without industry collaborators. This effect is particularly salient when the research line has important commercial implications and when the industry partner is an established firm.",2019,Business & Economics

The overall objective of this research was to assess the usefulness of patent expired maize inbred lines. Factorial crosses were made including North Dakota State University (NDSU) lines, ex-PVP lines, and top industry testers in the 2010 NDSU Fargo summer nursery and in the 2010-2011 NDSU New Zealand winter nursery. Hybrids were planted across six different ND environments in 2011 and 2012 following partially balanced lattice experimental designs. Combining ability analyses were performed following a factorial design with fixed parents. Our research identified ex-PVP inbreds PH207, Q381, PHP02, S8324, PHK76, CR1Ht, PHT77, LH205, LH54, and PHJ40 as above average lines in hybrid combinations to increase yield. Our trials suggest most ex-PVP lines are not useful directly for commercial purposes but could be used as potential breeding sources for short-season maize breeding programs. Improvements in intellectual property and re-thinking of breeding rights access are encouraged to explore more suitable hybrids for northern U.S. farms. Current industry lines have important trait weaknesses for northern U.S. climates that public sector breeders in strategic breeding locations could improve in order to develop better hybrids for farmers. Our preferred choice would be to partner with industry in order to improve current industry lines with known weaknesses, especially for northern U.S. and Canada environments.",2016,Agriculture; Plant Sciences
'Digital tech' and the public sector: what new role after public funding?,Innovation systems; entrepreneurial ecosystems; digital technology; cybersecurity; electronic trading; ,"Innovation scholars have long recognized entrepreneurship is imitative', whereas the commercialization of novelty is innovative'. Thus they are highly distinctive skill-sets. Entrepreneurship, first, involves optimizing market sentiment for pure profit sometimes to the point of catastrophe and even fraudulence in many markets. These include: payment protection insurance (PPI) to flash crashes', automotive emission defeat devices', corporate bribery settlements, social media hacking', fake news' and a litany of other infractions and catastrophes. Innovation, by contrast, is more explorative and team-reliant. Even if patenting betrays the hope for commercialization on markets, patented innovation frequently fails. Some academic innovators even profess a preference for prizes over profits. Second, this means that collective bonding' among entrepreneurs, in the form of claimed entrepreneurial ecosystems', is often based on a single customer platform or as a supplier of a highly specialist type of imitative' service from identikit pizza chains to me-too' smartphone apps. Through the latter, fused with artificial intelligence some interactive machine-learning services have long-existed as postsocial' algorithms serving customers of, for example, investment banks in stock and currency markets. Finally, entrepreneurship is fundamentally competitive, individualistic and non-solidaristic, whereas open innovation' was born from the practices of open science' and the collegiate tradition of research. Accordingly, entrepreneurial ecosystems' can display more closure than RIS set-ups. This special issue explores aspects of these ecosystem platforms and their implications for emergent forms of urban and regional evolution in the near and nearly present future.",2017,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies
Central nervous system integration of sensorimotor signals in oral and pharyngeal structures: oropharyngeal kinematics response to recurrent laryngeal nerve lesion,dysphagia; tongue kinematics; swallow control; infant; mammalian feeding; VOCAL FOLD IMMOBILITY; PATENT DUCTUS-ARTERIOSUS; AIRWAY PROTECTION; MECHANISMS; PARALYSIS; REFLEX; INPUT; DETERMINANTS; STIMULATION; INNERVATION,"Safe, efficient liquid feeding in infant mammals requires the central coordination of oropharyngeal structures innervated by multiple cranial and spinal nerves. The importance of laryngeal sensation and central sensorimotor integration in this system is poorly understood. Recurrent laryngeal nerve lesion (RLN) results in increased aspiration, though the mechanism for this is unclear. This study aimed to determine the effect of unilateral RLN lesion on the motor coordination of infant liquid feeding. We hypothesized that 1) RLN lesion results in modified swallow kinematics, 2) postlesion oropharyngeal kinematics of unsafe swallows differ from those of safe swallows, and 3) nonswallowing phases of the feeding cycle show changed kinematics postlesion. We implanted radio opaque markers in infant pigs and filmed them pre- and postlesion with high-speed videofluoroscopy. Markers locations were digitized, and swallows were assessed for airway protection. RLN lesion resulted in modified kinematics of the tongue relative to the epiglottis in safe swallows. In lesioned animals, safe swallow kinematics differed from unsafe swallows. Unsafe swallow postlesion kinematics resembled prelesion safe swallows. The movement of the tongue was reduced in oral transport postlesion. Between different regions of the tongue, response to lesion was similar, and relative timing within the tongue was unchanged. RLN lesion has a pervasive effect on infant feeding kinematics, related to the efficiency of airway protection. The timing of tongue and hyolaryngeal kinematics in swallows is a crucial locus for swallow disruption. Laryngeal sensation is essential for the central coordination in feeding of oropharyngeal structures receiving motor inputs from different cranial nerves.",2016,Physiology; Sport Sciences
Endovascular management of carotid and vertebral artery dissections with new generation double-mesh stent and protection systems - single-center early and midterm,carotid artery; dissection; protection system; double-mesh stent; COMMUNITY,"Introduction: Symptomatic dissections (SD) of cervical arteries are still a therapeutic problem. Although endovascular management (EM) is currently a preferred method of treatment of SD, complications associated with this method of treatment in published reports are quite frequent (3-16%). Aim: In this retrospective study we analyzed the results of EM with novel, double-mesh stent and protection systems (PS) for SD of the internal carotid (IC) or vertebral arteries (VA) that coexisted with hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysmatic dilatation of the dissected artery. Material and methods: We evaluated the results of EM in 19 patients (men 15, median age: 55, range: 25-83), presenting with SD of the IC or VA with coexisting stenosis and/or aneurysmatic dilatation of the artery in segments C1-C5 of IC or V0-V4 of VA. Twelve patients had a stroke, 6 TIA, and 3 patients a headache and/or a neck pain with Horner syndrome. Stents and PS were tailored according to the location, length of dissection and coexisting stenotic or aneurysmatic lesions. Results: There were no new strokes, in-hospital deaths or other serious morbidities during the procedure and postprocedural hospital stay. There were no fatalities during 6-40 months of follow-up. In control angiographies performed after interventions all patients demonstrated a patent target artery, complete coverage of the dissection and aneurysm by stents and no new lesions in the area of the previous dissection. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that EM of SD of IC and VA with the new stents and PS is safe and effective with good early and midterm results.",2019,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
A smart device for islanding detection in distribution system operation,Distributed generation; Distribution system; Smart grids; lslanding; Distribution system protection; Anti-islanding relay; GENERATION; PROTECTION,"The present paper focuses on the design, realization and validation of the prototype of an innovative relay, named SmartID, for islanding detection in LV distribution systems. The SmartID adopts a patent-pending detection method: it uses local measurements to estimate the parameters of a linear model of the distribution system, which can be used to distinguish grid-connected from islanded operation. The hardware of the SmartID prototype is composed of a voltage transducer, some conditioning stages, a commercial mu controller and an output stage. The software implements the A/D conversion of the measurements, the phasors evaluation by Kalman Filters, the model parameters estimation by a constrained recursive least-squares algorithm, and the detection criteria. The validation of the SmartID is performed on a test site in a smart grid located in Isernia (Molise, Italy). Experimental results show the good performance of the SmartID in the detection of both grid-connected and islanded operation; transitions from one condition to the other is only partially analyzed, due to the limitations introduced by the use of a commercial DG.

"Intellectual Property, Scientific Independence, and the Efficacy and Environmental Impacts of Genetically Engineered Crops",; AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY; INDUSTRY; INNOVATION; PATENTS; SCIENCE; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; CAPITALISM; LIFE,"Neoliberalism is the political ideology behind efforts to commercialize university science. The development of genetically engineered (GE) crops has facilitated the commercialization process because GE crops generally have more restrictive intellectual property protections than conventional crops. Those restrictions have led some to question whether long-term university research and innovations are being compromised to protect short-term intellectual property interests. This concern is evident in two letters submitted by public-sector entomologists in February 2009 to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The letters asserted that scientists are prohibited from conducting fully independent research on the efficacy and environmental impact of GE crops. In response to the letter, the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) negotiated an agreement between university scientists and seed companies to protect industry property rights while enabling university scientists to conduct research with more independence. Through a survey of public- and private-sector entomologists who are members of two regional entomologist research groups, we document scientists' perspectives on the adequacy of the ASTA agreement and whether those scientists have experienced limitations on their research projects involving efficacy and environmental impacts. Our findings show that limitations exist and that certain forms of public knowledge about crops are likely being compromised. These findings have implications for the legitimacy of current risk management institutions, as well as for future technological breakthroughs and innovations.",2015,Sociology
A Statistical Analysis of IrisCode and Its Security Implications,Biometrics; iris recognition; statistical dependence; Daugman algorithm; template protection; RECOGNITION,"IrisCode has been used to gather iris data for 430 million people. Because of the huge impact of IrisCode, it is vital that it is completely understood. This paper first studies the relationship between bit probabilities and a mean of iris images (The mean of iris images is defined as the average of independent iris images.) and then uses the Chi-square statistic, the correlation coefficient and a resampling algorithm to detect statistical dependence between bits. The results show that the statistical dependence forms a graph with a sparse and structural adjacency matrix. A comparison of this graph with a graph whose edges are defined by the inner product of the Gabor filters that produce IrisCodes shows that partial statistical dependence is induced by the filters and propagates through the graph. Using this statistical information, the security risk associated with two patented template protection schemes that have been deployed in commercial systems for producing application-specific IrisCodes is analyzed. To retain high identification speed, they use the same key to lock all IrisCodes in a database. The belief has been that if the key is not compromised, the IrisCodes are secure. This study shows that even without the key, application-specific IrisCodes can be unlocked and that the key can be obtained through the statistical dependence detected.",2015,Computer Science; Engineering
Intellectual property management at the National Animal Science Research Institute in India: A case study,Indian Council of Agricultural Research; intellectual property management system; intellectual property rights; National Institute of Veterinary Epidemiology and Disease Informatics; strengths; weaknesses; opportunities; threats analysis; ,"Background and Aim: The National Institute of Veterinary Epidemiology and Disease Informatics is an animal science research institute under the aegis of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. The intellectual property management system (IPMS) of the institute oversees technology creation, protection, and transfer/commercialization. This study reviews the effectiveness of the IPMS using traditional strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) evaluation. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive repository was developed to compile the SWOT pertaining to the IPMS based on relevant document reviews and the inputs of experts and stakeholders. The repository was shared among scientists of the institute for rating. The rating process revealed the top ten key SWOT associated with the structure and operation of the IPMS. The weighted SWOT matrix technique was used to identify the best strategies to improve and develop the IPMS further. This included strategies derived from the best combinations of key strengths and opportunities (S-O strategies), key weaknesses and opportunities (W-O strategies), key strengths and threats (S-T strategies), and key weaknesses and threats (W-T strategies). Results: The top-ranked strengths included possession of patented technology and state-of-the-art biosafety laboratory facilities, while lack of in-house faculty with legal expertise in intellectual property rights (IPR) and lack of technology incubation facilities were the key weaknesses. The key opportunities included external funding for research projects and market demand for onsite diagnostic tools. The major threats were lack of market for veterinary diagnostics and broadbased patents on research tools and technologies. Conclusion: The strengths of the system, such as a state-of-the-art biosafety laboratory and technology-marketing collaboration with Agrinnovate India Ltd., could be employed effectively to gain from the opportunities tendered by the market demand for on-site disease diagnostic tools (S-O strategies). The limitation arising from a dearth of technical staff could be overcome by technological backstopping through international linkages in the area of disease monitoring and surveillance. Funding from externally supported projects could also be utilized for recruitment of personnel (W-O strategies). Limitations arising from the combination of inadequate in-house IPR expertise and the threat arising from broad-based patents on research tools warrant vigilance (W-T strategies).",2019,Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences
From Transfer of Technology to Innovation Through Access,; COMPETITION,"While, in a traditional perception, IP law is all about protection and exclusivity, recent developments such as the strategic use of standard-essential patents (SEPs) present access rather than exclusion as a key driver for innovation. Although standardization generates important benefits to society it does also entail substantial risks such as the abuse of SEPs. From an analysis of important SEP-related practices it becomes evident that they constitute an important context in which a new demand for access to proprietary technology arises. When TRIPS is put to their litmus test, the result is double-edged. On the level of its fundamental provisions TRIPS cannot only accommodate the need for access. With its goal to balance the interests of technology owners and those who urge for a right to use protected technology TRIPS is even in the position to foster fair access. However, specific provisions on access requirements, such as Article 31 TRIPS on compulsory licenses, prove unsatisfactory. Until reform is brought about, the existing set of provisions must be read appropriately.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law

Ethnopharmacologists do fieldwork with indigenous peoples in traditional societies, where they encounter a wide range of cultural values and varying ideas about the nature of property relations. This poses difficulties for protecting indigenous intellectual property and for making just trade agreements. This Note reviews the legal issues relevant to the protection of indigenous resources in ethnopharmacology trade agreements, and suggests that recent developments in anthropology and the social study of science could be instructive in furthering the legal discourse and in providing policy directions. Specifically, the Note introduces the concepts of 'ontological pluralism' and 'epistemic subsidiarity', which could help lawmakers write sui generis trade agreements to better protect indigenous knowledge and resources.",2016,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine
Trends in Medicaid Reimbursements for Insulin From 1991 Through 2014,; HUMAN NPH INSULIN; DIABETES-MELLITUS; COSTS; GLARGINE; THERAPY; ADHERENCE; ACCESS,"IMPORTANCE Insulin is a vital medicine for patients with diabetes mellitus. Newer, more expensive insulin products and the lack of generic insulins in the United States have increased costs for patients and insurers. OBJECTIVE To examine Medicaid payment trends for insulin products. Cost information is available for all 50 states and has been recorded since the 1990s. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A time-series analysis comparing reimbursements and prices. Using state-and national-level Medicaid data from 1991 to 2014, we identified all patients who used 1 or more of the 16 insulin products that were continuously available in the United States between 2006 and 2014. Insulin products were classified into rapid-acting and long-acting analogs, short-acting, intermediate, and premixed insulins based on American Diabetes Association Guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Inflation-adjusted payments made to pharmacies by Medicaid per 1mL (100 IU) of insulin in 2014 US dollars. RESULTS Since 1991, Medicaid reimbursement per unit (1 mL) of insulin dispensed has risen steadily. In the 1990s, Medicaid reimbursed pharmacies between $2.36 and $4.43 per unit. By 2014, reimbursement for short-acting insulins increased to $9.64 per unit; intermediate, $9.22; premixed, $14.79; and long-acting, $19.78. Medicaid reimbursement for rapid-acting insulin analogs rose to $19.81 per unit. The rate of increase in reimbursement was higher for insulins with patent protection ($0.20 per quarter) than without ($0.05 per quarter) (P < .001). Total Medicaid reimbursements peaked at $407.4 million dollars in quarter 2 of 2014. Total volume peaked at 29.9 million units in quarter 4 of 2005 and was 21.2 million units in quarter 2 of 2014. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Between 1991 and 2014, there was a near-exponential upward trend in Medicaid payments on a per-unit basis for a wide variety of insulin products regardless of formulation, duration of action, and whether the product was patented. Although reimbursements for newer, patent-protected insulin analogs increased at a faster rate than reimbursements for older insulins, payments increased for all products we examined. Our findings suggest a lack of price competition in the United States for this class of medications.",2015,General & Internal Medicine

Unlike the other Burton brewing chemists, Griess paralleled his work at the brewery with significant contributions to the chemistry of synthetic dyes, managing to keep the two activities separate-to the extent that some of his inventions in dye chemistry were filed as patents on behalf of the German dye company BASF, without the involvement of Allsopp's. This seemingly unlikely situation can be explained partly by the very different attitudes to patent protection in Britain and in Germany combined with an apparent indifference to the significant business opportunity that the presence of a leading dye chemist presented to Allsopp's. Although his work for the brewery remained largely proprietary, Griess's discoveries in dye chemistry were exploited by the German dye industry, which quickly outpaced its British counterpart. One less well-known connection between brewing and synthetic dyes, and one that may further explain Allsopp's attitude, is the use of synthetic dyes in identifying microorganisms-the perennial preoccupation of brewers seeking to maintain yield and quality. Developments of Griess's original work continue to be applied to many areas of science and technology.",2016,History & Philosophy of Science

Firm characteristics (i.e., firm size and firm age) also show a moderating effect on the relationship between political connection and enterprises' private R&D investment; larger and older enterprises are more likely to have innovative resources and business cooperation partners, and thus are able to reduce their degree of reliance on political connections and government funding. The results of our study suggest the importance of having a transparent and fair institutional environment for enterprise innovation activities.",2019,Business & Economics
Fabric infused with a botanical repellent for protection against mosquitoes,Infused; repellent; fabric; protective; garment; insect; INSECT REPELLENTS; ESSENTIAL OILS,"Mosquito resistant apparel has become increasingly sought-after due to the rise in vector-borne illnesses such as the Zika Virus, Malaria, and Dengue Fever. Botanical insect repellents have been introduced to the market for consumers that desire a natural solution involving no pesticides or added chemicals. Fabric swatches consisting of 80% nylon and 20% elastane were separately treated with an organic repellent using a patented nonwoven vessel. The fabrics were then tested for effectiveness in repelling the mosquito Aedes aegypti using an arm-in-cage assay, the most commonly used method for mosquito repellents. The repellents were also evaluated and rated by study participants according to their preference for the appeal of the scent. The treatment method is user-friendly, enabling consumers to treat their clothing with an organic insect repellent as opposed to applying a synthetic chemical to their clothing and skin. The infused fabrics showed to be effective at repelling mosquitoes for up to 8 h after repellent infusion.",2019,Materials Science
Solution-driven approaches to generic substitution challenges - a survey among international experts,bioequivalence; experts opinions; generic substitution; patent protection; patient co-payment; patients' rights; COMPETITION; MEDICINES; DRUGS; BEHAVIOR; PATENTS; PRICE,"The main objective of this study was to explore the perception and understanding of economic, legal, and social barriers that may restrain generic uptake among recognized international experts in health care, and to identify and verify recommendations on how to streamline generic substitution (GS) at no expense of therapeutic safety. A questionnaire survey was devised, and experts with world-renowned expertise in the field of generic medicinal products were selected. Almost 3/4 of respondents claimed that all drugs that satisfy bioequivalence criteria represent similar efficacy and adverse effects, and 1/4 of respondents believed that some differences could be reported. The majority of experts supported (i) the right of patients to refuse GS, (ii) the right of physicians to veto GS, and (iii) the introduction of a statutory obligation to provide patients with access to the cheapest generics available on the market. The main obstacles to more general uptake of generics were as follows: (i) perception of generics as lower quality products, (ii) absence of a transparent policy governing GS, and (iii) disincentives to pharmacists and physicians. Among the most popular recommendations were as follows: (i) introduction of various measures to aid physicians in generic prescribing, (ii) setting clear guidelines specifying when GS is not advisable, (iii) supporting competition on the generic market. The views of experts and the resulting recommendations were strongly affected by their opinion on the bioequivalence of generics. From this analysis, we have selected several principal recommendations which could help shape successful healthcare policies regarding GS.",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

We report the fourth update of European Guidelines for the Management of RDS by a European panel of experienced neonatologists and an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the end of 2018. Optimising outcome for babies with RDS includes prediction of risk of preterm delivery, need for appropriate maternal transfer to a perinatal centre and timely use of antenatal steroids. Delivery room management has become more evidence-based, and protocols for lung protection including initiation of CPAP and titration of oxygen should be implemented immediately after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of management of RDS, and newer protocols for its use recommend early administration and avoidance of mechanical ventilation. Methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been further developed and may cause less distress and reduce chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease, although minimising time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and, if necessary, postnatal steroids are also important considerations. Protocols for optimising general care of infants with RDS are also essential with good temperature control, careful fluid and nutritional management, maintenance of perfusion and judicious use of antibiotics all being important determinants of best outcome.

Intellectual Property Strategy and the Long Tail: Evidence from the Recorded Music Industry,copyright; long tail; technology; intellectual property; digitization; WORD-OF-MOUTH; ONLINE; PIRACY; SALES; KNOWLEDGE; PATENTS; INFORMATION; COMPETITION; PROTECTION; SEARCH,"Digitization has impacted firm profitability in many media industries by lowering the cost of copying and sharing creative works. I examine the impact of digital rights management (DRM), a prevalent strategy used by firms in media industries to address piracy concerns, on music sales. I exploit a natural experiment, where different labels remove DRM from their entire catalogue of music at different times, to examine whether relaxing an album's sharing restrictions increases sales. Using a large sample of albums from all four major record labels, I find that removing DRM increases digital music sales by 10%, but relaxing sharing restrictions does not impact all albums equally. It increases the sales of lower-selling albums (i.e., the long tail) significantly (40%) but does not benefit top-selling albums. These results suggest that reducing search costs facilitates the discovery of niche products.",2018,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science

Process and organizational innovations abound more than product or supply chain management innovations. Foreign multinationals, the major contributor of patents in India, appear to be uninhibited by the current state of the IP protection regime, although this has deficiencies in enforcement. A new noteworthy trend is the rise of start-ups that hold promise as a source of product and business model innovations. Our analysis of the (limited) extant literature indicates a general dearth of empirical research on this topic relative to work on China; as such, there is scope for further research. Managerial Summary: This article offers a perspective on innovation in India by both Indian and foreign companies. Using an inward-outward lens, we conclude that while many Indian organizations have been the source of myriad process and incremental-as well as frugal-innovations that have cumulatively created value for companies and consumers, much of this has happened within the technological frontier and has been focused on lowering costs to meet the constrained affordability of Indian consumers (inward lens). At the same time, foreign multinationals have played an important role in initiating patent-creating R&D activity, mostly for global products (outward lens). Spillovers from these entities have, in part, fueled the emergent rise of start-ups, many of which are pursuing product innovation and, in some instances, frugal innovation.",2019,Business & Economics
Intellectual property rights hinder sequential innovation. Experimental evidence,Innovation; Intellectual property; Laboratory experiment; Real effort task; Creativity; PATENTS; COMPETITION; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; PROTECTION; TIME,"In this paper we contribute to the discussion on whether intellectual property rights foster or hinder innovation by means of a laboratory experiment. We introduce a novel Scrabble-like word-creation task that captures most essentialities of a sequential innovation process. We use this task to investigate the effects of intellectual property allowing subjects to impose license fees on their innovations. We find intellectual property to have an adverse effect on welfare as innovations become less frequent and less sophisticated. Introducing communication among innovators does not reduce this detrimental effect. Introducing intellectual property results in more basic innovations, with subjects failing to exploit the most valuable sequential innovation paths. Subjects act more self-reliant and non-optimally in order to avoid paying license fees. Our results suggest that granting intellectual property rights hinders innovation, especially for sectors characterized by a strong sequentiality in innovation processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Biosimilars: considerations in light of the Italian legal framework,Advertising; biosimilars; competition; Italy; public tenders; scientific information; ,"Biological and biotechnological medicines are important pharmaceutical innovations due to their influence on the treatment of many conditions and because they have led the way in devising new and innovative pharmacological therapies. In addition, biosimilars, which can be authorized on the date of expiry of a biological originator's patent, give an opportunity for the sustainability of national healthcare services. This paper explores aspects of Italy's 2017 Budget Law that emerged following a heated debate on legal doctrine and jurisprudence about biosimilars, the automatic substitutability between biological and biosimilar products, the purchasing processes of such medicines, and also on physician's freedom of prescription. This Law encourages the widespread adoption and use of biosimilar products, which is pivotal to making these next-generation medicines more economically viable for use in hospitals. It also sets out some principles that define the regulatory framework that always ensures the physician's freedom of prescription is a priority, as is patients' safety and protection.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

The fact that knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial firms publish their innovative ideas seems counterintuitive because publishing discloses ideas important to their market position. The literature holds at least two explanations for why such firms publish: Firms use competitive publication logic to invalidate or preempt intellectual property protection, and (more recently) scholarship holds that entrepreneurial firms use accretive publication logic to attract financial resources, enhance the reputation of in-house scientists, and obtain new technologies critical to the development of new products. After offering explanations as to why knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial firms publish, we examine the benefits and costs of doing so, examine under which conditions firms should publish, and articulate implications for future research.",2018,Business & Economics
Analysis of the Italian generic medicines retail market: recommendations to enhance long-term sustainability,demand-side policiy; generic medicine; Italy; market access; pharmaceutical; pricing; reimbursement; IMPACT; POLICY,"Italy is among the European countries with the lowest uptake of generic medicines. This paper provides a perspective on the Italian generic medicines retail market. Fast market entrance of generic medicines in Italy is hindered by several factors: the existence of Complementary Protection Certificates in the past, the large market for copies and multiple cases of patent linkage. Prices of generic medicines in Italy are low compared to other European countries. To contain pharmaceutical expenditure, pharmaceutical companies are currently forced to pay back in case of overspending, which disproportionally penalizes small and fast growing companies, to which most generic companies belong to. Current demand-side policies do not successfully stimulate the use of generic medicines. The current market environment surrounding the Italian generic medicines retail market (i.e., low prices, low volumes) threatens its long-term sustainability.

Some companies are improving the original product, and these drugs are called biobetters. Even among the producers of biosimilars one finds different strategies, and these are linked to different government regulations concerning the approval of these products. Some biosimilar companies are aiming at developed-country markets (North America, the European Union and Japan), while other producers are targeting emerging, less-regulated markets. This introduction will present the dynamic picture of an industry in transition.

This paper reviews design protection in the European Union, discusses this legal instrument to protect designs and design innovations, and provides an overview of how RCDs are used by firms from different countries and industries. To develop a more detailed understanding of their usage, we also report an exploratory qualitative study on the use of RCDs by German firms in three industries: footwear, car manufacturing and tool-making. This revealed some important differences, notably between judicious filing and all-you-can-file strategies, which implies that future research using this instrument requires attention be paid to firm and industry level behaviors. We develop a set of propositions, and set out a research agenda. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015,Business & Economics

DR usually focuses on drugs that have cleared phase-I safety trials but has yet to show efficacy for the intended indication. Therefore, DR can probably skip the preclinical and phase-I study, which can reduce the cost throughout drug development. However, the expensive phase-II/III trials are required to establish efficacy. The obstacles to DR include identification of new indications with a high success rate in clinical studies, obtaining funding for clinical studies, patent protection, and approval systems. To tackle these obstacles, various approaches have been applied to DR worldwide. In this perspective, we provide representative examples of DR and discuss the ongoing efforts to overcome obstacles to DR in Japan.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Activating Actavis in Europe - the proposal of a structured effects-based' analysis for pay-for-delay settlements,; ,"Striking the right balance between the protection of competition law and intellectual property rights is of utmost importance, especially in the pharmaceutical sector; affordable generic drugs are as important as new innovative drugs. Pay-for-delay settlements take place at exactly this intersection. They end patent infringement litigation but, at the same time, delay entry of generic drugs by means of a substantial payment from the brand company to the generic. Whereas the US Supreme Court opted for a rule of reason approach that requires an analysis of the potential anticompetitive effects, the European Commission regarded such settlements as restriction by object, finding an infringement without the need for an effects-based analysis. This approach is criticised and a novel structured effects-based' approach is proposed allowing the authority to effectively scrutinise such settlements while striking the right balance in order to protect the innovative process and the exercise of intellectual property rights.",2016,Government & Law
Foreign direct investment and collective intellectual property protection in developing countries,Intellectual property rights; Foreign direct investment; Developing countries; TRIPS agreement; PATENT RIGHTS; FDI; DETERMINANTS,"This paper analyzes spillovers associated with intellectual property rights (IPRs) in developing countries, and investigates how these spillovers influence the desirability of IPRs reform. I provide evidence that foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into a developing country are positively associated with IPRs in that country, as well as IPRs in adjacent developing countries. This finding suggests the presence of multilateral effects related to IPRs that existing analyses do not account for. I develop a general equilibrium international product cycle model to accommodate these spillovers, and find that they create an individual incentive to maintain weak IPRs. However, strengthening IPRs through a multilateral agreement improves welfare among all reforming countries. I argue that this finding suggests a novel justification of international IPRs agreements among developing countries; by preventing free-riding behavior, these agreements allow mutual benefit through collective policy action.

By employing cross-country IQ scores traditionally used by psychological literature to represent national intelligence, and Economic Complexity Index as a novel measure of innovation, our study shows that there is a positive connection between them. We use a variety of tests to check the robustness of the nexus. Overall, our findings indicate that more intelligent nations export more sophisticated and diverse products to the world market and thus are more innovative. Therefore, developing countries should consider investing in human capital and related institutions if they are to boost innovative capabilities and move up the technology ladder in producing and exporting sophisticated and varied lines of products. This should bring them greater economic diversity which could be a right lever in mitigating negative external shocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Biosimilars in Developed and Developing East and Southeast Asian Countries: Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia-Overview, Evolution, and Regulations Assessment",; SAFETY,"The development of biological products has experienced continuous growth over the past three decades. The expiration of patent protection for many biological medicines has led to the development of biosimilars in many countries around the world. This paper reviews the literature on biosimilar drugs and covers their therapeutic status, clinical trials, approved biosimilars, and regulatory guidelines in Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. The literature suggests that biosimilars are comparable but not identical to the reference product. They are not a generic version of an innovative product and do not ensure therapeutic equivalence. Biosimilars present more challenges than conventional generics and their marketing approval is also much more complicated. Guidelines for biosimilars were published in Japan in July 2009 by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), in South Korea in March 2009 by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), and in Malaysia in July 2008 by the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB).",2016,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Research & Experimental Medicine
Protecting the Rights of Farmers and Communities While Securing Long Term Market Access for Producers of Non-timber Forest Products: Experience in Southern Africa,; ,"The participatory domestication of agroforestry trees as an incentive to alleviate poverty, malnutrition, hunger and land degradation has to be linked to the commercialization of the products in ways that ensure that the farmers are the beneficiaries of their germplasm improvement activities, as well as from the marketing of the products. Currently, international law is deficient in providing adequate protection of the rights of poor farmers and their communities, as the legal instruments of Intellectual Property legislation are focused more on the protection of commercial companies and entrepreneurs. PhytoTrade Africa is engaged in addressing the sustainable use and commercialization of natural products produced by indigenous plants, especially trees of the Miombo woodlands in southern Africa. Initially the market focus has been on wild-harvested naturally occurring resources using innovative approaches to protecting the Intellectual Property Rights of poor communities and the businesses they work with, including Patents, Trademarks, and Geographical Indicators, with the intention of securing long-term strategic market access and to be able to influence commercial strategy. The approach which has been developed is to work with indigenous communities and local companies and to help them to secure long-term access to these markets through the protection of their intellectual property rights. Experience to date indicates that, by enabling market opportunities for these local resources, significant livelihood options for otherwise marginalized farmers and producers can be facilitated. Partnerships between producers and the local-to-global cosmetic, food, beverage, herbal medicine and pharmaceutical industries are developed by carefully constructing commercial agreements with leaders in the relevant sector. Critically this involves the establishment of a strong and viable trade association that is forward thinking and market oriented. Through these partnerships it is possible to ensure long-term relationships and supply agreements. Such agreements ensure that the target producers remain in the value chain. This paper also explores opportunities for protecting farmer-improved germplasm through the registration of Plant Breeders Rights in compliance with the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) and proposals for an affiliated African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI).",2017,Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry

They support activation of the complement lectin cascade in the presence of MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2), a protein that cleaves the C4 and C2 complement components. Recent studies found that distinct MBL2 and FCN2 promoter variants and their corresponding serum levels are associated with relative protection from urogenital schistosomiasis. Methods We investigated the contribution of MASP-2 levels and MASP2 polymorphisms in a Nigerian study group, of 163 individuals infected with Schistosoma haematobium and 183 healthy subjects. Results MASP-2 serum levels varied between younger children (12years) and older children (>12years) and adults (P=0.0001). Younger children with a patent infection had significantly lower MASP-2 serum levels than uninfected children (P=0.0074). Older children and adults (>12years) with a current infection had higher serum MASP-2 levels than controls (P=0.032). MBL serum levels correlated positively with MASP-2 serum levels (P=0.01). MASP2 secretor haplotypes were associated with MASP-2 serum levels in healthy subjects. The heterozygous MASP2 p.P126L variant was associated with reduced serum MASP-2 levels (P=0.01). Conclusions The findings indicate that higher MASP-2 serum levels are associated with relative protection from urogenital schistosomiasis in Nigerian children.",2015,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Tropical Medicine"
"Validation of Fermentation and Processing Procedures for the Commercial-Scale Production of a Live, Attenuated Edwardsiella ictaluri Vaccine for Use in Channel Catfish Aquaculture",; ENTERIC SEPTICEMIA,"Mortality associated with Edwardsiella ictaluri infection is a serious impediment to the commercial production of fingerling Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus. A patented, live, attenuated, orally delivered vaccine has been developed that offers exceptional protection against E. ictaluri infection in both laboratory and small-scale pond trials. Further vaccine development is contingent on the successful completion of large-scale field trials that accurately reflect industry conditions. This current work focuses on the validation of fermentation protocols and the optimization of downstream processing procedures to produce sufficient quantities of vaccine to conduct commercial-scale field trials. Eight vaccine serials were produced from a master seed stock (S97-773-340X2) in a 50-L floor model fermenter over two consecutive years. Following fermentation, cells were harvested, concentrated 10-fold, and cryogenically stored (-74 degrees C). To assess processing protocols and determine shelf life of cryogenically stored vaccine, serials were tested for cell viability and vaccine potency at various intervals over 24 months. There were no significant differences in cell viability between the fresh vaccine and the stored frozen product. All serials provided a high level of protection (77-100% relative percent survival) against E. ictaluri infection in juvenile Channel Catfish and exhibited excellent poststorage viability. This data demonstrates that the live, attenuated, orally delivered vaccine can be stored at -74 degrees C for at least 2 years with no reduction in cell viability or vaccine potency.",2017,Fisheries; Veterinary Sciences

We earlier demonstrated recombinant heavy chain myosin of B. malayi (Bm-Myo) as a potent vaccine candidate whose efficacy was enhanced by heterologous DNA prime/protein boost (Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo) vaccination in BALB/c mice. BALB/c mouse though does not support the full developmental cycle of B. malayi, however, the degree of protection may be studied in terms of transformation of challenged infective larvae (L3) to next stage (L4) with an ease of delineating the generated immunological response of host. In the current investigation, DNA vaccination with Bm-Myo was therefore undertaken in susceptible rodent host, Mastomys coucha (M. coucha) which sustains the challenged L3 and facilitates their further development to sexually mature adult parasites with patent microfilaraemia. Immunization schedule consisted of Myo-pcD and Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo followed by B. malayi L3 challenge and the degree of protection was evaluated by observing microfilaraemia as well as adult worm establishment. Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo immunized animals not only developed 78.5% reduced blood microfilarial density but also decreased adult worm establishment by 75.3%. In addition, 75.4% of the recovered live females revealed sterilization over those of respective control animals. Myo-pcD+BmMyo triggered higher production of specific IgG and its isotypes which induced marked cellular adhesion and cytotoxicity (ADCC) to microfilariae (mf) and L3 in vitro. Both Th1 and Th2 cytokines were significantly up-regulated displaying a mixed immune response conferring considerable protection against B. malayi establishment by engendering a long-lasting effective immune response and therefore emerges as a potential vaccination method against LF.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics

The Agreement, which was concluded as part of and under the pressure of the GATT/WTO trade package, provides for internationally uniform standards of adequate protection of intellectual property in all States Members of the WTO, regardless of the differences of their economic development, industrial structures and social needs. As a global deep trade agreement, which governs not only cross border trade, but Members' internal markets, it raises issues both of its compatibility with the principle of comparative advantage underlying international trade, and of the legitimacy of its interfering with domestic market regulation. The flexibilities, which have been built into the TRIPS Agreement, may mitigate concerns. However, the growing new biand pluri-lateralism of regional free trade agreements with their asymmetric intellectual property rules, the re-distribution of economic power among the developed and the emerging or rather the emerged countries, and the nature of strategic competition between globally acting multinational corporations have changed the rules of the game. The task ahead is to re-conceptualize the TRIPS Agreement as a framework regulation for national innovation markets, which at the same time are integrated into global markets to varying degrees. As such, it would form part of an open international economic law, which, in its turn, needs to be developed in order to overcome the rigid and already fading paradigms of international trade law. Only such a vision will help to accommodate intellectual property protection with the large diversity of industrial policies and with the many intellectual property-related public interests and policies, which WTO Members may or do adhere to.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
The Effect of Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Host Economies on The Sustainable Development of China's Outward Foreign Direct InvestmentEvidence from a Cross-Country Sample,outward foreign direct investment (OFDI); intellectual property rights protection (IPRP); the Belt and Road initiative (B&R); sustainable development; investment risk; dynamic panel data; PATENT RIGHTS; LOCATION CHOICE; PANEL-DATA; GRAVITY; IMITATION,"Intellectual property rights protection (IPRP) has caused great concern in China, especially since the introduction of the Belt and Road (B&R) initiative. The Chinese government has increased investments to the countries along the B&R, most of which are developing countries with high investment risks. Using the panel data of China's outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) in 121 countries from 2003 to 2017, the sustainable relationships between the IPRP of host countries and China's OFDI has been analyzed. The results of this paper show that, from the worldwide perspective, the stronger the IPRP of the host country, the greater attraction to China's OFDI. While the IPRP of the countries along the B&R has a nonlinear U-shaped effect on China's OFDI, which is related to the complex environments of the countries. When the IPRP of the B&R countries is within a certain range, China's OFDI is biased toward a country with lower IPRP, and when the IPRP exceeds a certain range, China's OFDI is biased toward a country with higher IPRP. Moreover, the market size, natural resources endowment and political environment of the host country are influential upon China's OFDI as well. What deserves our attention is that China's OFDI is more biased towards countries with poor political conditions, which can be related to the enterprise type and that most of the large multinational enterprises in China are state-controlled, resulting in investment decisions largely reflected by the national political goals rather than simple market targets.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
Controlled human malaria infection by intramuscular and direct venous inoculation of cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in malaria-naive volunteers: effect of injection volume and dose on infectivity rates,Controlled human malaria infection; Malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; Cryopreserved sporozoites; Human challenge infection; INTRADERMAL INJECTION; CHALLENGE; VACCINE; MOSQUITOS; IMMUNIZATION; PROTECTION; EFFICACY; IMMUNITY; POVERTY,"Background: Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by mosquito bite is a powerful tool for evaluation of vaccines and drugs against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, only a small number of research centres have the facilities required to perform such studies. CHMI by needle and syringe could help to accelerate the development of anti-malaria interventions by enabling centres worldwide to employ CHMI. Methods: An open-label CHMI study was performed with aseptic, purified, cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ Challenge) in 36 malaria naive volunteers. In part A, the effect of the inoculation volume was assessed: 18 participants were injected intramuscularly (IM) with a dose of 2,500 PfSPZ divided into two injections of 10 mu L (n = 6), 50 mu L (n = 6) or 250 mu L (n = 6), respectively. In part B, the injection volume that resulted in highest infectivity rates in part A (10 mu L) was used to formulate IM doses of 25,000 PfSPZ (n = 6) and 75,000 PfSPZ (n = 6) divided into two 10-mu L injections. Results from a parallel trial led to the decision to add a positive control group (n = 6), each volunteer receiving 3,200 PfSPZ in a single 500-mu L injection by direct venous inoculation (DVI). Results: Four/six participants in the 10-mu L group, 1/6 in the 50-mu L group and 2/6 in the 250-mu L group developed parasitaemia. Geometric mean (GM) pre-patent periods were 13.9, 14.0 and 15.0 days, respectively. Six/six (100%) participants developed parasitaemia in the 25,000 and 75,000 PfSPZ IM and 3,200 PfSPZ DVI groups. GM pre-patent periods were 12.2, 11.4 and 11.4 days, respectively. Injection of PfSPZ Challenge was well tolerated and safe in all groups. Conclusions: IM injection of 75,000 PfSPZ and DVI injection of 3,200 PfSPZ resulted in infection rates and pre-patent periods comparable to the bite of five PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes.

The Risks of Revolution: Ethical Dilemmas in 3D Printing from a US Perspective,3D printing; Additive manufacturing (AM); Ethics of technology; Intellectual property; Safety; ,"Additive manufacturing has spread widely over the past decade, especially with the availability of home 3D printers. In the future, many items may be manufactured at home, which raises two ethical issues. First, there are questions of safety. Our current safety regulations depend on centralized manufacturing assumptions; they will be difficult to enforce on this new model of manufacturing. Using current US law as an example, I argue that consumers are not capable of fully assessing all relevant risks and thus continue to require protection; any regulation will likely apply to plans, however, not physical objects. Second, there are intellectual property issues. In combination with a 3D scanner, it is now possible to scan items and print copies; many items are not protected from this by current intellectual property laws. I argue that these laws are ethically sufficient. Patent exists to protect what is innovative; the rest is properly not protected. Intellectual property rests on the notion of creativity, but what counts as creative changes with the rise of new technologies.",2016,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Engineering; History & Philosophy of Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Philosophy

After a brief overview of the main evolutionary concepts which guide the subsequent discussion, our presentation identifies four main eras: from the formative stages (from the late 1800s to War World II) to the so-called Golden Age (the 1940s to the mid-1970s), the biotechnology revolution (the 1970s to the new millennium, approximately) and what we label the 'Winter of Discontent?' (the first decade of the new century). Within all these epochs, we discuss the main trends in technology, firms' strategies and structures, patterns of competition, demand, regulation and institutional developments. Section 6 concludes the article, briefly discussing some main implications for the present and future of the industry on the one hand and for the relevance of an evolutionary approach to the analysis of corporate and industrial change on the other.",2015,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics
Automated enclosure and protection system for compact solar-tracking spectrometers,; PORTABLE FTIR SPECTROMETERS; COLUMN MEASUREMENTS; EMISSIONS,"A novel automated enclosure for protecting solar-tracking atmospheric instruments was designed, constructed, and successfully tested under various weather conditions. A complete automated measurement system, consisting of a compact solar-tracking Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (EM27/SUN) and the enclosure, has been deployed in central Munich to monitor greenhouse gases since 2016 and withstood all critical weather conditions, including rain, storms, and snow. It provided ground-based measurements of column-averaged concentrations of CO2, CH4, O-2, and H2O throughout this time.& para;& para;The enclosure protects the instrument from harmful environmental influences while allowing open-path measurements in sunny weather. The newly developed and patented cover, a key component of the enclosure, permits unblocked solar measurements while reliably protecting the instrument. This enables dynamic decision regarding taking measurements, and thus increases the number of data samples. This enclosure leads to a fully automated measurement system, which collects data whenever possible without any human interaction. In the long term, the enclosure will provide the foundation for a permanent greenhouse gas monitoring sensor network.",2018,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences

After presenting the challenges associated with financing innovation from a theoretical point of view, the section synthetizes extant literature to show how these challenges constrain the process of raising funds and investing in innovation. The section then describes the role of business angels and venture capital funds, as well as public policy initiatives in support of these investors. Albeit these instruments have been traditionally conceptualized as remedies to these problems, the section also stresses their limitations and critical aspects. Finally, the section provides an overview of the most recent and emerging tools of financing innovation, such as crowd-funding. In particular, we adopt a business-law perspective to describe these instruments and illustrate the trade-off between the protection of investors and the facilitation of innovation, which challenges both scholars and policymakers. The section concludes with a synthetic research agenda with the aim to encourage future research on the functioning of these financial innovations.",2019,Business & Economics
"The Reception of Rene Lalique's Work in the United States, 1900-1940",; ,"This article discusses the arrival and reception of the works of the French artist and glass industrialist Rene Lalique (1860-1945) in the United States, based on important, recently discovered documents from the personal archive of his son-in-law, the well-known American photographer Paul Haviland (1880-1950), in Paris. It addresses the questions of how we should regard Lalique's art glass and to what extent industrial innovations, patent protection, and social circumstances played a role in his artistic developments. The article maps Lalique's quest for the creation of so-called modern industrial luxury. Topics covered in this assessment include Lalique's artistic developments in the pivotal period, about 1909, when his shift to glass was becoming unavoidable; his first all-glass presentation in the United States; and his activities during and after the war years (1914-1918). Thanks to a profusion of documents and additional finds, it is possible to provide a broader outline of Lalique the man, the artist, and the industrialist as well as the manner in which his output was regarded in the United States between 1900 and 1940.",2016,Art
Does the strengthening of IPRs widen the growth gap?,innovation; cumulative causation; growth gap; intellectual property rights; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PATENT RIGHTS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; INVESTMENT; TRANSITION; POLICY; TRADE,"This article builds a model of cumulative growth in order to analyze the relationship between intellectual property rights (IPRs) and economic growth in 38 countries from 1980 to 2005. The analysis focuses on the impacts of IPRs on the growth gap between countries using a catch-up model and USPTO database. The empirical results show that the strengthening of IPRs has a positive impact on innovation in developed and developing countries in Asia, while we fail to find evidence in Latin America. Secondly, similar to assertions made by De Long and Summers (1991) and Dowrick and Nguyen (1989), investment in fixed capital plays a critical role in growth gap dynamics. What needs to be emphasized here is the cumulative causal relationship between investment and growth: investment in fixed capital improves productivity and encourages economic growth thereby triggering even more investment. This paper confirms that the strengthening of IPRs and investment in fixed capital contribute to the widening of the economic development gap for the 1980-2005 period.",2015,Business & Economics
The Complexities of Biosimilars and the Regulatory Approval Process,; INTERCHANGEABILITY; EXTRAPOLATION; FDA; GUIDANCE; ONCOLOGY; SCIENCE; HURDLES,"Created via the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, the biosimilar class of drugs was conceived as an opportunity to introduce competition for commonly used biologics following loss of patent protection and market exclusivity, similar to the generic paradigm that has helped sustain access and innovation for more than 3 decades. The FDA approves a biosimilar after a manufacturer establishes that the product is highly similar to a previously approved originator biologic reference product without any clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. Given the concerns about increasing healthcare costs and this new opportunity to reduce the expense associated with biologics, including many commonly used oncology medications, the use of biosimilars will likely increase as numerous stakeholders, including managed care organizations, begin to implement policies to encourage adoption. As biosimilars are a relatively new class of drugs, clinical, scientific, and regulatory aspects continue to evolve and improve. Understanding those various aspects can improve clinician acceptance and advance the science of biologics and biosimilars. In this report, various factors are addressed to improve the knowledge of biosimilars, including clinical, manufacturing, and cost considerations.",2018,Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine

We report two cases of Crouzon syndrome involving a 3-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl, who were both treated with monobloc Le Fort III DO using a combination of external and internal distraction devices (Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland) to treat severe orbital proptosis and obstructed nasopharyngeal airway secondary to severe hypoplastic craniofacial skeletal components. Their skeletal segments were advanced in daily increments by 27 mm and 23 mm, respectively. Results at 18 months postoperatively showed successful outcomes, as evidenced by adequate eye protection, tracheostomy tube decannulation following objective evidence of patent nasopharyngeal airway, and acceptable facial appearance.

Complete Molecular Weight Profiling of Low-Molecular Weight Heparins Using Size Exclusion Chromatography-Ion Suppressor High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry,; SULFATE; CHIP,"Low-molecular weight heparins (LMWH) prepared by partial depolymerization of unfractionated heparin are used globally to treat coagulation disorders on an outpatient basis. Patent protection for several LMWH has expired and abbreviated new drug applications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. As a result, reverse engineering of LMWH for biosimilar LMWH has become an active global endeavor. Traditionally, the molecular weight distributions of LMWH preparations have been determined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with optical detection. Recent advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods have enabled exact mass measurements of heparin saccharides roughly up to degree-of-polymerization 20, leaving the high molecular weight half of the LMWH preparation unassigned. We demonstrate a new LC-MS system capable of determining the exact masses of complete LMWH preparations, up to dp30. This system employed an ion suppressor cell to desalt the chromatographic effluent online prior to the electrospray mass spectrometry source. We expect this new capability will impact the ability to define LMWH mixtures favorably.",2016,Chemistry

To overcome the cost and accelerate the discovery of novel drug, in silico methodologies have made an enormous contribution. This chapter discusses the paradigm of bioinformatics and its translational approaches in drug discovery. Public domain database and efficient data mining approaches are the most optimum criteria for identification and selection of data, whereas genomic technologies such as microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS) stand for its target identification and validation process. The use of molecular docking and QSAR techniques under the structure-and ligand-based discovery helps in screening the chemical data from nonfunctional to functional ones in terms of activity and toxicity. However, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) simulation can help produce desired concentrations and least side effects with an approximately computed dose regimen.",2017,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology
Organic-inorganic Hybrid Coatings via Sol-gel Route for Leather Finishing,; SURFACE MODIFICATION; PROTECTION,"Despite its popularity in other industries, including textiles, for the preparation of inorganic and hybrid coatings, the use of sol-gel for leather finishing is a barely explored field. To exploit its unique and versatile chemistry, we have here evaluated the potential of sol-gel route for preparing protective coatings and achieve, at the same time, water-repellency on treated leather. To this aim, tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (TEOS) and functionalized Si-alkoxides, containing either alkyl or fluorinated groups were selected and compared. The results of characterization indicate that, for the chosen formulations, alcohol-based sols were patently more effective than their water-based counterparts. Very high contact-angles were obtained for both alkyl-and fluorinated alkoxides, but, not surprisingly, fluorinated coatings provided a longer-lasting hydro-repellency. Sols well preserved leather grain, with no patent accumulation on pores or ridges, while only minor changes in color was observed in most formulations. Overall, our results suggest that a careful optimization of sol-gel formulation can offer unexplored, versatile and very effective solutions in leather finishing.",2019,Chemistry; Materials Science

When an Importer's Protection of IPR Interacts with an Exporter's Level of Technology: Comparing the Impacts on the Exports of the North and South,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PATENT RIGHTS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PANEL-DATA; INNOVATION; TRIPS,"Using bilateral trade data of countries from 2000 to 2007, this paper contributes to the empirical literature on the role of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in global trade. The existing literature has focused on how IPRs in the destination country affect exports from a source country. In this paper, we add an additional dimension: the level of technology of the exporting country (LT). This is quite important for distinguishing the impact of IPRs on the exports of developed and developing countries, since the technology levels vary across countries at different stages of development and intellectual property rights better protect exports that are technologically advanced than exports that are imitative and potentially infringing. By factoring in the level of technology (LT), our empirical analysis makes the case that IPRs can act as a barrier to the exports from the South, especially the rapidly catching-up economies, and thus be a source for the middle-income trap phenomenon.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations

An empirical test using a sample of 2,122 Portuguese SMEs from four different sectors of the 2012 Community Innovation Survey indicated that for manufacturing; water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation activities; and wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; informal appropriability mechanisms, such as lead-time and complexity, are more effective for converting product innovation into financial performance in the short term. On its turn, for extractive sectors (Mining and Quarrying), formal mechanisms (e.g., patents) are better to protect product innovation and informal mechanisms are more effective to protect process innovation.",2019,Business & Economics
How to Create a Friendly Environment for Innovation? A Case for Europe,Friendly innovation environment; Social and political factors; European countries; Panel data analysis; ,"It is a misjudgement to assume that R&D subsidies, patent protections or alike are sufficient to promote innovation. In fact, innovations incubate and hatch within an environment, especially if it is a friendly one. The aim of this paper is to look for the major factors which are the building blocks or pillars of such an environment. After discussing and analysing the theoretical and empirical studies on the major social and political factors which are the likely constituents of our inquired environment, four major blocks or pillars appear to be the basic components on theoretical grounds. They are identified as the four different categories of inclusiveness, namely legal/regulatory, political and economic, social, and informatory. A model is developed by employing variables representing these four groups to measure and to analyse their impact on innovation. The model is tested by utilising the panel data of European countries. The results indicate that a favourable environment for innovation requires the existence of rule of law, gender equality, economic and political stability, and access to information.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Sociology
3D Printing Techniques in the Pharmaceutical Sciences - Intellectual Property Issues,3D printing; Intellectual property; Patents; Trade marks; Designs; Infringement; ,"Additive manufacturing, specifically three-dimensional printing (3DP), has been in use in the manufacture of medical devices for some time, with the FDA recently issuing draft guidance for technical considerations in this regard. More recently however, attention has turned to the use of these techniques in modern medicinal manufacture, in particular, orally administrable dosage forms and drug-loaded implants. In addition to the technical challenges faced by inventors in this field, there are a number of legal issues which are likely to develop as 3D printing becomes more widespread, more specifically regarding not only the procurement and enforcement of intellectual property rights, but also potentially arising at the interface of 3D printed pharmaceuticals with competition and consumer protection laws. Intellectual property law can be complex and varies from country to country.

Improving the effectiveness of nondisclosure agreements by strengthening concept learning,; TRADE SECRETS; PROTECTION; PATENT; MANAGEMENT; QUESTIONS; LAW; IP,"Intellectual property infringements rank among the top economic crimes, even though there are mechanisms in place to prevent their occurrence. One such mechanism are nondisclosure agreements, which, however, have been reported to fail in practice. This article argues that this may be overcome by strengthening employees' concept learning. In an experiment, we investigated whether extended nondisclosure agreements, which provide the employee with detailed explanations and examples, lead to better recognition of trade secrets as compared to a standard nondisclosure agreement or no agreement at all. It was found that the extended nondisclosure agreement indeed increased participants' ability to judge what falls under the trade secret law, whereas the standard nondisclosure agreement showed no such effect. Furthermore, the effects of the factors `Involvement', `Specificity', `Publicity', and `Purpose' on the identification of trade secrets could be proven experimentally. Employees' judgments of whether an information represents a trade secret seem to rely on general cognitive processes. From this follows that concept learning could be integrated into systematic approaches for protecting intellectual property.",2017,Business & Economics

It is used for the prevention and treatment of apnea, although this has been associated with lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and patent ductus arteriosus as well as intact survival at 18-21 months of life. Although neurodevelopmental advantage was no longer statistically significant at age 5 years, caffeine was associated with sustained improvement in co-ordination and less gross motor impairment than placebo. The mechanism of action of caffeine on prevention of apnea and activation of breathing seems to be through central inhibition of adenosine receptors. However, its impact on BPD and neurodevelopmental outcomes might be induced through its effects as anti-inflammatory mediator, protection of white matter, and induction of surfactant protein B. Whereas long-term studies have documented the safety of caffeine as used in current practice, further studies are clearly needed to identify optimum dosing, and time of starting and discontinuing caffeine.

This sequence language allows breeders to monitor, help identify, and select for useful diversity thereby developing new improved varieties. Although much genetic diversity in wild ancestral species was not transferred into domesticated species, surprisingly high levels of diversity have been retained during the past century, a period of intensive selection for increased productivity. Diversity in modern varieties exhibits temporal flux associated with bottlenecks due to grain quality or specific introductions of germplasm. There is no evidence over many decades in the twentieth century of a narrowing of the genetic base. Diversity has increased in some crops due to conscious sourcing of landrace diversity. Finding useful diversity to provide successful genotype by environment (G x E) interaction remains both the essential challenge for plant breeders and an assurance that new genetic diversity must continue to be sourced in order to allow continued genetic gain in a dynamic agricultural environment. Plant breeders can never afford to be complacent about stewardship and use of genetic diversity. Trends of genetic diversity usage should be regularly monitored in breeding programs and in commercial agriculture.",2015,Agriculture; Biodiversity & Conservation; Plant Sciences
TRIPS and Competition Rules: From Transfer of Technology to Innovation Policy,; ,"The competition-related provisions in the TRIPS Agreement were very much influenced by the context in which the Agreement was concluded. The inclusion of competition provisions served a specific purpose. Competition law was basically seen as a tool to facilitate the transfer of technology. Twenty years after the entry into force of TRIPS, the legal landscape within which IPRs are exercised has experienced tremendous changes on the IP front, as well as on the competition law front. IP protection tends to be raised beyond the minimum standards of TRIPS, questionable protection has been granted specially in the field of patents, enforcement mechanisms and remedies have been strengthened and IP portfolios are strategically used in the markets. From an international perspective, higher IP standards have been exported through bilateral and regional trade agreements. Competition law is developing at a very fast speed, especially in emerging and developing economies. Moreover, competition law and IP laws are increasingly understood as being complementary to each other. A strict and conflict oriented reading of TRIPS' competition provisions does not help to cope with the new strategies of innovation and the new forms of use of IPRs. We argue in this paper that a flexible reading of the competition-related provisions in TRIPS provides enough room for applying competition law as an innovation instrument. Hence, the application of competition law to combat IP-related restraints of competition that inhibit innovation would be covered by the rationale of the TRIPS Agreement just as much as an application of competition law aimed at enhancing access to and dissemination of IP-protected products.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Structural preconditions for the rise of the rule of law in China,China; rule of law; governance; rationalized enforcement; accountability; intellectual property rights; environmental protection; DEMOCRACY,"This essay advocates for adopting a disaggregated approach when evaluating the progress that non-democratic countries like China are making towards establishing the rule of law. An understanding that the rule of law may develop in some areas, though not in others, allows us to identify the structural underpinnings of a limited rule-of-law system. The essay adopts a procedural definition of the rule of law as rules-based governance and argues that the regularized enforcement of laws and regulations is the key precondition for its emergence. This study defines regularized enforcement as consistent, transparent, and procedurally fair enforcement and identifies the conditions under which such enforcement may emerge. Although bureaucracies with clear mandates can provide this type of enforcement, it is more likely to develop when courts of law arise as the main enforcers of laws and regulations. The theoretical argument about the issue-specific rule of law in China is illustrated through three case studies. The first is of government accountability, where progress towards the rule of law has been minimal. The second is of intellectual property rights, where regularized enforcement has unexpectedly developed, especially for patents and copyrights. The third area is environmental protection, which is explicitly following the model of intellectual property rights. The essay concludes by arguing that an issue-specific approach allows us to grasp more fully the variation in good governance and progress towards establishing the rule of law that exists on the ground in China.",2016,Government & Law; Public Administration
CLAIMING DESIGN,; PROPERTY; TRADEMARKS,"Design stands out among intellectual property subject matter in terms of the extent of overlapping protection available. Different forms of intellectual property usually protect different aspects of a product. In the design context, however, precisely the same features are often subject to design patent, trademark, and copyright protection-and parties commonly claim more than one of those forms. Yet, as we show, the claiming regimes of these three forms of design protection differ in significant ways: the timing of claims; claim format (particularly whether the claims are visual or verbal); the multiplicity of claims (whether and how one can make multiple claims to the same design); and the level of abstraction at which parties claim rights. These methodological dfferences have significant effects on the operation of each individual regime. All of the claiming regimes have significant shortcomings, particularly in terms of the quality of notice the claims provide to third parties about their scope. That notice problem is worsened, as we argue, by the frequent cumulation of rights in the same design. Claim ambiguity and parties' ability to switch back and forth between different design claims-both within and across legal regimes-make it difficult for courts and third parties to evaluate the validity and scope of rights. There is significant irony here because intellectual property claims exist almost entirely to provide notice. Cumulation also enables design rightsholders to assert rights in one or more regimes using the claiming rules that benefit them most at a particular moment, without any risk that those claiming choices will bind them in later rights assertions. We suggest a number of improvements to each claiming regime that would help restore internal order. We also analyze various approaches to ameliorating the amplified costs of overlapping regimes for claiming design. In particular, we focus on doctrines of election and channeling rules as alternative methods of directing designs to one regime or another. We also introduce the possibility of transsubstantive intellectual property claiming rules as a way to reduce important inconsistencies across these regimes while also allowing protection under multiple regimes. Each of these solutions would alleviate at least some of the concerns we identify, though one's preference among them will likely depend on one's level of concern about overlapping rights.",2018,Government & Law

We developed an aorta-iliac bypass technique to treat thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) in young Chinese patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of this technique intraoperatively and postoperatively. Methods From June 2014 to March 2015, 28 patients underwent TAAAR using aorta-iliac bypass technique. A four-branched tetrafurcate graft was used. Two branches of the graft are sutured to bilateral common iliac arteries in an end-to-side fashion. The trunk of the graft was sutured to the proximal descending aorta in an end-to-end fashion. Then aorta-iliac bypass was established, and the lower extremities, viscera organ and spinal cord (SC) obtained perfusion from proximal descending aorta via the bypass graft. The thoracic and abdominal aorta were clamped in a staged fashion. The patent segmental arteries (SAs), and visceral arteries (coeliac trunk, superior mesenteric arteries, and renal arteries) were reattached sequentially. Evoked potential (EP) monitoring was adopted to assess the SC ischaemia throughout the procedure. The postoperative outcomes and follow-up results of this technique were evaluated. Results There was no in-hospital mortality. Complications included acute kidney dysfunction and pulmonary haemorrhage in one case (3.6%) each. The SAs were reattached in all cases. The EP wave disappeared after proximal descending aorta was clamped, and gradually recovered after the patent SAs reattached. The median follow-up after operation was eight months (range, 1-10 months). There was no delayed neurologic deficit or late death. Conclusions Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair using aorta-iliac bypass may be a simple and safe choice for young Chinese patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.",2016,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW AND THE RIGHT TO REPAIR,; FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL CONCEPTIONS; FAIR-USE; PATENT SCOPE; NATURAL LAW; COPYRIGHT; PREEMPTION; POLICY; INNOVATION; ANTITRUST; PROGRESS,"This Article posits that intellectual property law should accommodate consumers' right to repair their products. In recent years, there has been a growing push towards state legislation that would provide consumers with a right to repair their products. Currently, twenty states have pending legislation that would require product manufacturers to make available replacement parts and repair manuals. Unfortunately, though, this legislation has stalled in many of the states. Manufacturers have been lobbying the legislatures to stop the enactment of these repair laws based on different concerns, including how these laws may impinge on their intellectual property rights. Indeed, a right to repair may not be easily reconcilable with the United States' far-reaching intellectual property rights regime. For example, requiring manufacturers to release repair manuals could implicate a whole host of intellectual property laws, including trade secrets. Similarly, employing measures that undercut a manufacturer's control of the market for replacement parts might conflict with patent exclusivity. Nonetheless, this Article holds that intellectual property laws should not be used to prevent a right to repair from being fully implemented. In support of this claim, this Article develops a theoretical framework that justifies a right to repair in a manner that is consistent with intellectual property protection. Based on this theoretical foundation, this Article then explores, for the first time, the various intellectual property rules and doctrines that may be implicated in the context of the current repair movement. As part of this analysis, this Article identifies areas where intellectual property rights could prevent repair laws from being fully realized, even if some of the states pass the legislation, and recommends certain reforms that are necessary to accommodate the need for a right to repair and enable it to take hold.",2019,Government & Law

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified radiation safety protocol in reducing patient dose during paediatric interventional cardiac catheterisation. Methods: Radiation dose data were retrospectively extracted from January 2014 to December 2015 (Standard group) and prospectively collected from January 2016 to December 2017 (Low-dose group) after implementation of a modified radiation safety protocol. Both groups included five most common procedures: atrial septal defect closure, patent ductus arteriosus closure, perimembranous ventricular septal defect closure, pulmonary valvuloplasty, and supraventricular tachycardia ablation. Results: Median air Kerma was 48.4, 50.5, 29.75, 149, 218, and 12.9 mGy for atrial septal defect closure, pulmonary valvuloplasty, patent ductus arteriosus closure <20 kg, ventricular septal defect closure <20 kg, ventricular septal defect closure >= 20 kg, and supraventricular tachycardia ablation in Standard group, respectively, which significantly decreased to 18.75, 20.7, 11.5, 41.9, 117, and 3.3 mGy in Low-dose group (p < 0.05). This represents a reduction in dose to each patient between 46 and 74%. Among five procedural types in Low-dose group, dose of ventricular septal defect closure was the highest with median air Kerma of 62.5 mGy, dose area product of 364.7 mu Gy.m(2), and dose area product per body weight of 21.5 mu Gy.m(2)/kg, respectively, along with the longest fluoroscopy time of 9.9 minutes.

Preliminary report of a single-channel applicator in high dose rate afterloading brachytherapy for cervical cancer,cervical carcinoma; clinical trial; concurrent chemoradiotherapy; high dose rate brachytherapy; radiotherapy; RATE INTRACAVITARY IRRADIATION; LOCALLY ADVANCED-CARCINOMA; RADIATION-THERAPY; RECOMMENDATIONS; SURVIVAL; TOXICITY; CRITERIA; QUALITY,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a patented single-channel applicator, which was modified from the traditional tandem applicator and wrapped with an oval-shield alloy around the source channel, has the same clinical efficacy and safety as the standard Fletcher-type applicator in high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy for carcinoma of the cervix. Between December 2011 and February 2017, 299 patients with pathologically confirmed International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (2009) stage Ib2-IVa cervical cancer were recruited to the trial and finished the allocated intervention. Of the first 151 patients, 71 were allocated to the Fletcher group and 80 to the single-channel group, satisfying the criteria for a preliminary analysis. All but 3 patients were treated with concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy followed by HDR brachytherapy. The 2-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and locoregional failure-free survival was 80.3%, 77.5%, and 78.9%, respectively, for the Fletcher group, and 86.3%, 82.5%, and 83.8%, respectively, for the single-channel group. The seriousness of acute treatment-related toxicities was similar in the 2 groups. The cumulative rate of late rectal complications of grade 3-4 in the Fletcher group and the single-channel group was 2.8% and 2.5%, respectively. The cumulative rate of grade 3 bladder complications was 2.8% for the Fletcher group and 1.3% for the single-channel group. The preliminary results of our study show that the patented single-channel intracavitary applicator might be able to provide protection for the rectum and bladder and seems to have the same clinical efficacy as the standard Fletcher-type 3-channel applicator in HDR brachytherapy for carcinoma of the cervix. This trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration no. ChiCTR-TRC-12002321).",2018,Oncology

Only two volunteers have been similarly immunized with P. vivax (Pv) RAS, and both were protected. A phase 2 controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety and protective efficacy of PvRAS immunization. Methodology/Principal Findings A randomized, single-blinded trial was conducted. Duffy positive (Fy+; Pv susceptible) individuals were enrolled: 14 received bites from irradiated (150 +/- 10 cGy) Pv-infected Anopheles mosquitoes (RAS) and 7 from non-irradiated non-infected mosquitoes (Ctl). An additional group of seven Fy-(Pv refractory) volunteers was immunized with bites from non-irradiated Pv-infected mosquitoes. A total of seven immunizations were carried out at mean intervals of nine weeks. Eight weeks after last immunization, a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with non-irradiated Pv-infected mosquitoes was performed. Nineteen volunteers completed seven immunizations (12 RAS, 2 Ctl, and 5 Fy-) and received a CHMI. Five of 12 (42%) RAS volunteers were protected (receiving a median of 434 infective bites) compared with 0/2 Ctl. None of the Fy-volunteers developed infection by the seventh immunization or after CHMI. All non-protected volunteers developed symptoms 8-13 days after CHMI with a mean pre-patent period of 12.8 days. No serious adverse events related to the immunizations were observed. Specific IgG1 anti-PvCS response was associated with protection. Conclusion Immunization with PvRAS was safe, immunogenic, and induced sterile immunity in 42% of the Fy+ volunteers. Moreover, Fy-volunteers were refractory to Pv malaria.",2016,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine
Patently obvious: a public health analysis of pharmaceutical industry statements on the Trans-Pacific Partnership international trade agreement,New Zealand; USA; international trade agreements and health; access to medicines; public health; policy analysis; pharmaceutical industry; MEDICINES; ACCESS; AUSTRALIA; MEDICATION,"The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) is a regional trade agreement being negotiated by 12 countries, including New Zealand and the United States of America (USA). The patent-holding pharmaceutical industry (the Industry) has lobbied for enhanced intellectual property protections and rules affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement in the TPPA. These provisions would likely reduce access to affordable medicines. This paper reports on a study exploring how the Industry has used language to frame the TPPA in an effort to influence opinion and exert leverage. We undertook a thematic analysis of the language used in publicly available statements about the TPPA from the Industry's national associations in the USA and New Zealand. Data included press releases, submissions and other statements dated 2008-2013. The Industry framed the TPPA as contributing to the public good. The TPPA was portrayed as redressing inequitable pharmaceutical policies, which limit people's access to new medicines. Further, the TPPA was constructed as the route to economic growth for the USA and ultimately for all TPPA countries, through increased intellectual property protection for the pharmaceutical industry. This framing obscured tensions between Industry interests and public health goals. The Industry remained silent on the issue of affordability, a key dimension of equitable pharmaceutical access. The use of rhetoric, such as win-win outcomes' (for TPPA countries and the Industry), hid the vested economic interests of the Industry in the TPPA. Understanding the Industry's framing of issues can assist public health advocates in challenging prevailing discourses and exposing vested interests.",2016,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Biomedical Social Sciences"
Biosimilar vs biological agents in rheumatology: When are biosimilar agents similar enough?,Biosimilar; Biological agents; AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASES; PERSPECTIVE; THERAPIES,"With the introduction of biological agents, over the last two decades treatment prospects in many medical fields including Rheumatology have experienced an exciting revolution. The advent of biological therapy for specifically rheumatic diseases has provided more effective control of both the underlying disease, and sustained amelioration of disease activity, compared to the pre-biological era when only anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs were available. Although the importance of potential improved clinical outcome cannot be overstated, these efficacious treatments for rheumatic diseases are not without a high cost. Biological agents are expensive and rheumatological diseases are common. The patent and regulatory data protection periods for the first and second waves of biological agents based on recombinant proteins have begun to expire, leaving open the potential for development and regulatory approval of one or more generic versions of these biological therapies, termed biosirnilars or BSs in Europe (the term we shall use from henceforth), subsequent entry biologics in Canada, or follow-on-biologics in US. We aimed to review the critical topics of efficacy, safety and regulatory approach of upcoming biosimilars. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015,Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy
THE CASE AGAINST FEDERALIZING TRADE SECRECY,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COMMON-LAW; COVENANTS; FOUNDATIONS; RULES,"TRADE secrecy is unique among the major intellectual property (IP') doctrines because it is governed primarily by state law. Recently, however, a number of influential actors including legislators, academics, high-technology firms, and organizations representing IF attorneys and owners have supported the creation of a private civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation under federal law. Proponents assert that federalizing trade secrecy would provide numerous benefits, including substantive uniformity, the availability of a federal forum for misappropriation litigation, and the creation of a unified national regime for IF rights. This Article engages in the first systematic critique of the claim that federalizing trade secrecy is normatively desirable. Ultimately, it concludes that there are multiple reasons for trade secrecy to remain primarily the province of state law, including preservation of the states' ability to engage in limited experimentation regarding the scope of trade secret protection and federalization's potential negative impact on the disclosure of patent-eligible inventions. Finally, it proposes an alternative approach a modest expansion of federal courts' jurisdiction over state law trade secret claims that can help address the issue of trade secret theft without requiring outright federalization.",2015,Government & Law
Anti-foreign bias in the court: Welfare explanation and evidence from Canadian intellectual property litigations,Home country bias; Legal system; Intellectual property rights; PATENT EXAMINATION; SUPREME-COURT; RIGHTS; PROTECTION; PROCUREMENT; TECHNOLOGY; INVESTMENT; DIFFUSION; OUTCOMES; SUCCESS,"Are judges concemed, in the same way as policy makers, with the effects of their decisions on national welfare? In this paper, we analyze this question by examining the outcomes of intellectual property rights (IPR) litigations between domestic and foreign firms. We use a simple model of oligopoly, in which IPR takes the form of a more efficient production technology, to illustrate how antiforeign bias varies across cases when judges have welfare concerns. The predictions of the model are tested using data on all Canadian IPR cases over a four-year period. We find that foreign firms have about 25 percentage points lower probability of protecting their IPR in Canadian courts relative to domestic firms. We also find that courts' decisions are aligned with national welfare maximization principles so that foreign firms are less likely to win in those cases when the implied welfare gains from not protecting foreign IPR are greater. These findings are robust to controlling for endogenous selection of firms into litigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2019,Business & Economics

The hybrid product evidenced an extraordinary hydrophobicity character, able to guarantee a high protection of the stone against water actions, as well as a high traspirability. Furthermore, it is able to equal the performance of commercial available coatings, with the important adjunctive advantage to be free solvent. The application of this product involves the use of a dual curing treatment, necessary to harden the coating applied on the substrate, representing this latter a technological limit. The dual curing treatment consists of 6hr of exposure to a UV-lamp plus 1hr at 140 degrees C in oven. In order to avoid this procedure, not easy to realize in situ, two different modifications of the composition of the hybrid product are proposed in this paper. The first one allows the photopolymerization of the hybrid coating only by sunlight exposure. The second one, even though requiring a UV exposure to photo-polymerize the coating, does not need the subsequent thermal treatment at 140 degrees C. Several experimental characterizations were performed on the newly developed hybrid products, in order to select an optimal composition for the formulations. The selected innovative products were, finally, applied on a calcareous stone substrate, typical of Apulia Region (Pietra Leccese, PL). Both coatings exhibit excellent water-repellent action and a slight variation of the natural stone color. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2015,Polymer Science

Using firm-level data from 41 countries spanning 2002-2013, we find environmentally sustainable practices and R&D-intensity enhance the risk-taking of firms. Voluntary sustainable practices generate a positive and significant effect on corporate risk-taking. We also find that country-level determinants play a complementary role. Firms operating in countries with better intellectual property rights protection and overall infrastructure benefit more from environment-friendly practices and R&D intensity. Further, we find that ESI has a positive effect on risk taking in countries with higher CO2 emissions per capita, energy usages per capita and more stringent environmental policies. These results are robust after correcting for potential endogeneity, alternative measures of R&D intensity or ESI score. Overall, our findings provide key insights on policy recommendations at the national and international levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017,Business & Economics
Similar or the Same? Why Biosimilars are not the Solution,; SCIENCE,"Advancements in the field of biotechnology have accelerated the development of drugs that are manufactured from cultures of living cells, commonly referred to as biologics. Due to the complexity of the production process, generic biologics are unlikely to be chemically identical to the reference product, and accordingly are referred to as biosimilars. Encouraging the development of biosimilars has been presented as the key solution to decrease prices and increase access to biologics, but the development and use of biosimilars continues to raise problems, none of which can easily be addressed. Developing a biosimilar requires considerable time and financial resources, and legitimate safety concerns necessitate elaborate clinical testing of biosimilars. As a consequence, the introduction of biosimilars onto the market has not resulted in significant price reductions, and concerns regarding the substitution and interchangeability of original biologics with biosimilars persist. This article will explain how the biologics production process distorts the trade-offs that traditionally guided both patent protection and regulatory exclusivities: disclosure as a key condition for benefiting from the corresponding monopoly position. Hence, we propose establishing a mechanism of mandatory deposit of the original biologic's cell line at the stage of the regulatory approval as the most effective remedy.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine

Very few studies estimate recreational use value of beaches particularly for those living close (less than 10 km) to the beach (locals). They typically have dissimilar visit patterns and low or zero travel costs because of their proximity to the recreation site. This study uses the latent class framework to extend the standard count data models to estimates the economic value of beaches for locals in the Capricorn Coast region of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland. Results indicate that values for beach use among the locals differ depending on their visit patterns.

We deal with an optimization problem to model the optimal government's behavior in presence of dynamic uncertainty and intervention costs. More specifically, we search for the optimal strategies to be implemented by a policy maker to optimally balance the number of innovators and imitators. The problem is first tackled from a purely theoretical perspective and then by implementing extensive numerical simulations on the basis of empirical data. By the theoretical perspective, we obtain a rigorous proof that optimal strategies depend on the initial value of the number of imitators and not on the initial ratio between innovators and imitators, whereas the simulations provide us with intuitive insights from an economic point of view, along with a validation of the theoretical results. The results support the evidence that governments choose the possible widest bandwidth and minimize the size of interventions so as to curb intervention costs.

The main objective of our study is to probe the joint effect of RAC and dual AMs on the innovation performance of enterprises (FIP), and to do this, we describe the AMs by distinguishing between formal appropriability mechanisms (FAM) and informal appropriability mechanisms (IAM). To examine our hypotheses, we empirically analyzed a sample of 297 manufacturing enterprises in China's Yangtze River Delta region. The results indicate that RAC has a direct, negative effect on FIP, and IAM negatively moderates the negative relationship between RAC and FIP, while the moderating role of FAM is insignificant These findings are helpful for clarifying the influence of RAC on FIP under different AMs settings, thereby guiding enterprises to use different appropriability tools to avoid the negative influence of RAC and to better protect the innovation profits of enterprises.",2019,Business & Economics
Establishing Therapeutic Equivalence of Complex Pharmaceuticals: The Case of Dabigatran,; ,"Dabigatran is widely used for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran is no longer patent-protected in Canada and 2 generic formulations were recently approved by Health Canada. Branded dabigatran uses a complex formulation to maintain the acidic micro-environment required for maximal absorption. Consequently, food does not influence its bioavailability and the efficacy and safety of dabigatran are similar with or without concomitant intake of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Unfortunately, current bioequivalence criteria do not mandate testing of the generic formulations with food or with concomitant intake of PPIs; thus, the only data available for the approved generic products are in fasted, healthy volunteers. Without confirmation that the bioavailability of the generic dabigatran products is maintained in the presence of food or with coadministration of PPIs, it is uncertain whether they will afford patients the same protection from stroke as the branded product. Clinicians and patients must be made aware of this limitation to make informed prescribing decisions. The rules for establishing bioequivalence have not kept pace with the increasing complexity of pharmaceutical products; we urge regulators to update the regulatory process to ensure the therapeutic equivalence of generic products.",2018,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology

So far, CHMI is done by exposure of volunteers to bites of five mosquitoes carrying Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ), a technique available in only a few centres worldwide. Mosquito-mediated CHMI is logistically complex, exact PfSPZ dosage is impossible and live mosquito-based interventions are not suitable for further clinical development. Methods: An open-labelled, randomized, dose-finding study in 18-45 year old, healthy, malaria-naive volunteers was performed to assess if intravenous (IV) injection of 50 to 3,200 aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ is safe and achieves infection kinetics comparable to published data of mosquito-mediated CHMI. An independent study site verified the fully infectious dose using direct venous inoculation of PfSPZ. Parasite kinetics were assessed by thick blood smear microscopy and quantitative real time PCR. Results: IV inoculation with 50, 200, 800, or 3,200 PfSPZ led to parasitaemia in 1/3, 1/3, 7/9, and 9/9 volunteers, respectively. The geometric mean pre-patent period (GMPPP) was 11.2 days (range 10.5-12.5) in the 3,200 PfSPZ IV group. Subsequently, six volunteers received 3,200 PfSPZ by direct venous inoculation at an independent investigational site. All six developed parasitaemia (GMPPP: 11.4 days, range: 10.4-12.3). Inoculation of PfSPZ was safe. Infection rate and pre-patent period depended on dose, and injection of 3,200 PfSPZ led to a GMPPP similar to CHMI with five PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes. The infectious dose of PfSPZ predicted dosage of radiation-attenuated PfSPZ required for successful vaccination. Conclusions: IV inoculation of PfSPZ is safe, well tolerated and highly reproducible. It shall further accelerate development of anti-malarial interventions through standardization and facilitation of CHMI. Beyond this, rational dose selection for whole PfSPZ-based immunization and complex study designs are now possible.",2015,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine

To fill the knowledge gap, phthalate esters were measured in 96 over-the-counter medicines made in China, including selected 71 Chinese patented medicines and 25 western medicines. It was found that none of the medicines was free of phthalates. The mean concentrations of individual phthalates ranged from 0.001 mu g/g (dicyclohexyl phthalate) to 5.85 mu g/g (diethyl phthalate). Among 9 targeted phthalates, di-n-butyl phthalate was the dominant congener, accounting for >65% of the total phthalates in all medicine samples, followed by di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and diethyl phthalate. Phthalates in medicines appeared to derive from gastroresistant film coatings, plastic packing materials or phthalate contaminated rural herbal plants (especially for Chinese patented medicines). Daily human exposure to phthalates was estimated for local patients for one treatment cycle (e.g., one week) based on suggested consumption dosage and phthalate concentrations. Almost all exposure levels were below the guidelines suggested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or European Food Safety Authority, indicating low health risk with phthalates from consumption of the medicines. In addition, concentration levels of phthalates in patients would increase upon administration but are expected to decrease to the same values as those in patients before they took medicines in several days. Because the number of medicine samples was limited and the concentrations of phthalates varied in a large range, further investigations are needed to acquire more data for better assessment of human health effects for Chinese population.

When technology's value is not observable, innovators with more valuable technology disclose their private information to receive a fair payment despite a rival's earlier challenge, whereas the owner of less valuable technology reveals nothing. We show that the more valuable technology is and the less bargaining power the innovator has, the more information the innovator discloses. This finding is consistent with empirical evidence on inventors' disclosure strategy after the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA). Furthermore, we show that despite the information disclosure, innovators make R&D investment earlier than they would have under symmetric information. This is in contrast with conventional wisdom that the need to disclose complementary information may retard innovation, and can be explained by the interaction between the decisions of investment timing and information disclosure. Though the leading innovator suffers losses from information asymmetry, the total value of the firms in the market may increase due to the diffusion of knowledge. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The development of innovative drugs, especially in the form of vaccines, is key to minimizing the scale and impact of future outbreaks, yet current intellectual property (IP) regimes are ineffective in supporting this goal. Scholarship has not adequately addressed the role of IP in the development of vaccines for outbreak diseases. This Article fills that void. Through case studies on the recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks, it provides the first descriptive analysis of the role of IP from the pre- to the post-outbreak stages, specifically identifying IP inefficiencies. The Article concludes that these inefficiencies result in a lack of IP preparedness that ultimately weakens our ability to respond effectively to outbreaks. To solve the problem, we need a blend of new and existing legal tools. This Article surveys existing solutions and proposes a new legal mechanism: a dormant license, agreed upon in the pre-outbreak period, that would become active once a public health emergency is declared. This solution addresses transactional IP inefficiencies during the early stages of an outbreak and helps get vaccines to the market more efficiently to save lives.",2018,Government & Law

CONCEPTUAL SEPARABILITY AS CONCEIVABILITY: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS OF THE USEFUL ARTICLES DOCTRINE,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW; COPYRIGHT; ECONOMICS; FASHION; DESIGN,"In copyright law, the useful articles doctrine plays a significant role in defining the limits of copyright's domain and the boundary between copyright and patent. But the implicated notion of conceptual separability has proved to be difficult to define, and the Supreme Court's effort to define it in the recent case Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc. is unsatisfying. In an effort to resolve this challenge, the present paper puts forth a novel test for conceptual separability, one that draws inspiration from the philosopher's idea of conceivability. The test is the following question: When you conceive of the relevant useful article as lacking the design element in question, is the article you imagine functionally identical to the actual article? If the answer to this question is yes, then the design element is conceptually separable from the article's utilitarian aspects; if not, then the element has failed the test, and it is not entitled to copyright protection. The present paper explores why this novel proposal avoids many of the pitfalls of existing tests (including the Court's own in Star Athletica), why it best achieves the aims of the useful articles doctrine, and what questions remain once the challenge of conceptual separability has been resolved.",2018,Government & Law

More recently, the application of the Rietveld method has disseminated also in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and other high added-value industrial areas, where it is exploited in the operational planning, formulation analysis, and in patent protection. Nowadays, in consequence of this diffusion, several academic and private laboratories provide phase quantitative analysis using the Rietveld method as customers service, but an accreditation procedure is still pending and lacks a protocol for checking the authenticity and quality of the analytical reports.

This study analyzes the joint effects of absorptive capacity and depth of appropriability regime forms on a firm's new product development. Specifically, we distinguished absorptive capacity between the potential and realized absorptive capacities and appropriability depth as formal and strategic forms. To test our research hypotheses, we analyzed empirical evidence from 311 Taiwanese service firms. The results reveal that the potential and realized absorptive capacities have significant effects that help explain a firm's new product development. Additionally, there are moderating effects of absorptive capacity on new product development performance. The formal appropriability depth exerts a positive effect on the relationship between the realized absorptive capacity and a firm's new product development. The strategic appropriability depth positively moderates the influence of the potential absorptive capacity on a firm's new product development. Finally, the study concludes that complementary nature of absorptive capacity and appropriability strength plays a critical role in contributing to new product development.",2019,Business & Economics
Elimination of Thermal Bridges in the Construction of a Flat Low-Pressure Solar Collector by Means of a Vacuum Thermal Insulation Bushing,solar collector; flat-plate vacuum collector; design innovation; bushing; ,"The paper deals with the elimination of heat losses in a flat low-pressure solar collector caused by direct contact of outlet pipefitting and the Al-Mg collector box. This is manifested by reduced thermal efficiency of the solar collector, especially in cold season, which is in direct conflict with its application, i.e., high-temperature application and application in cold conditions. The solution lies in the proposed new structural element-the vacuum thermal insulation bushing, which is able to simultaneously provide vacuum tightness of the collector box and interrupt the existing thermal conductive connection. The design philosophy was to transfer the vacuum insulating function component from the original pipe-collector box connection to the thermally insulated place bushing-collector box. Two prototypes were constructed and built into experimental vacuum chamber. Significant increase in the temperature gradient was found in performed experiments. Thermal insulation function, vacuum tightness, and resistance to thermomechanical stress have been demonstrated.

Development of structured natural dyes for use into plastics,Natural dyes; Sol-gel process; Xenon-accelerated; Weathering; ,"This study aimed to identify whether natural dyes encapsulated in a silica matrix via the sol-gel process with the use of alkoxides (as described in INPI patent BR 10 2013 0219835) and subsequently injected into a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) matrix would preserve their original color characteristics after being subjected to Xenon-accelerated weathering (using the ASTM D4452-12 standard). A comparison was conducted of the same natural dyes - carmine, turmeric, indigo and annatto - with and without encapsulation, injected into the same PVC matrix. Color change measurements were made before the weathering test and after 126 h, 252 h, 378 h and 504 h in a Xenon weathering chamber using the ASTM D4459-12 standard. A non-encapsulated Tartrazine dye (INS 102, an azo dye) was used for comparison of the behavior of natural dyes vs. that of synthetic ones. The results pointed to a lack of discoloring protection for the encapsulated natural dyes, which lost saturation more severely than the non-encapsulated ones. It thus follows that some care-is required during the encapsulation stages of natural dyes, such as careful dispersion of natural colorants and the inclusion of repeat stages for the encapsulation of the xerogel.

The Effect of European Intellectual Property Institutions on Chinese Outward Foreign Direct Investment,China; Europe; institutions; intellectual property; OFDI; PATENT PROTECTION; INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION; ENTRY STRATEGIES; LOCATION CHOICE; RIGHTS; FIRM; FDI; TRANSITION; ECONOMIES; RESOURCES,"This study examines the role of the strength of the Intellectual Property (IP) institutions of 23 European countries in attracting Chinese Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) during the time period 2003-2015. Following a dynamic panel data analysis methodology, we find that the strength of IP institutions has a positive effect in attracting higher levels of OFDI from China. This is an important finding for the OFDI literature from emerging markets, since previous studies have researched this relationship from the OFDI perspective of developed countries. However, we also find a weak indication of a potential U-shaped relationship between the strength of IP institutions and Chinese OFDI. To better understand this relationship, we interact a European country's membership in the Former Eastern Bloc (FEB) with the strength of IP institutions and find a negative moderating effect. We therefore find that when investing in FEB countries, Chinese firms are attracted to weaker levels of IP institutional strength. The results of this study have important implications for future studies on the determinants of OFDI from emerging markets, as well as for European and Chinese businesses and policy-makers concerning the importance of IP institutional strength.",2019,Business & Economics

Two different TiO2 nanoparticle material were produced by the Sol-Gel approach, one using the patented Captigel method and the other one applying TiBALDH precursor. The particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering and nano particle tracking analysis. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the bacterium was living in clusters on the roots and the combined energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed that titanium was present in these cluster formations. Confocal laser scanning microscopy further demonstrated an increased bacterial colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots and a semi-quantitative microscopic assay confirmed an increased bacterial adhesion to the roots. An increased amount of adhered bacteria was further confirmed by quantitative fluorescence measurements. The degree of infection by the fungus was measured and quantified by real-timeq-PCR. Results showed that Titania nanoparticles increased adhesion of beneficial bacteria on to the roots of oilseed rape and protected the plants against infection.",2015,Science & Technology - Other Topics
A Chinese Traditional Therapy for Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Mice,; CTGF; EXPRESSION; FEITAI; INOS,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and fatal disease of lung tissue with high incidence and mortality in the world. The exploration of effective treatment for pulmonary fibrosis remains an urgent challenge. In our study, Qingfei Xieding was investigated as a novel Chinese traditional patent medicine against pulmonary fibrosis. A pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was constructed by injecting with bleomycin sulfate. Following Qingfei Xieding administration, lung samples were collected to assess pulmonary phenotype changes by analyzing lung coefficient, wet/dry, and histopathologic section. Levels of nitric oxide (NO), hydroxyproline (HYP), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity were measured to evaluate the degree of oxidation. A single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay was used to evaluate bleomycin-induced DNA damage. Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR were performed to determine the abundance of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and fibronectin (FN). In the present study, Qingfei Xieding administration significantly attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice by reducing lung coefficient, wet/dry, NO, HYP, and MDA as well as the expression of iNOS, CTGF, alpha-SMA, FN, and DNA damage. The results indicated that Qingfei Xieding is effective to resist oxidative damage and histopathologic lesion, serving a protection role on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",2018,Respiratory System

Most of the recently approved biopharmaceuticals represent drugs that are produced by biotechnological processes involving recombinant DNA. Thus, this review article mainly focusses on protein therapeutics. However analogous considerations also apply for other large molecule therapeutics. As early approved blockbuster biopharmaceuticals run out of patent protection shortly, a growing interest in biosimilar production results in the need of proper analytical-characterization and comparison of inventor and biosimilar. In contrast to small molecule drugs small variations in the production process may strongly impact the final biological. Thus, quality assurance of biopharmaceuticals results in much higher analytical effort compared to small molecules. This review gives an overview on analytical methods for characterization of protein biologicals. Classical methods such as gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography are summarized and complemented with state-of-thelart mass spectrometric investigations. Full molecule investigations of native or denaturized proteins as well as methods including digestion (middle-down and bottom-up) are discussed. Furthermore, literature on glycoprotein analysis using glycopeptide, released glycan and monosaccharide analysis is reviewed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Competition Law and IP Rights: Not So Complementary: Time for Re-alignment of the Goals?,; ANTITRUST; PROTECTION; EFFICIENCY; ECONOMICS; CONSUMER; COSTS,"This article argues through a US/EU comparative assessment of the intellectual property (IP) law goals and competition law goals that whilst the overarching goals of competition law and IP rights to enhance overall economic welfare are still complementary, internal conflicts within the two legal spheres are jeopardizing the achievement of these goals. Within the IP laws the private/public reward/incentive to innovate equilibrium is now being tilted in favour of private interests due to recent developments in terms of rapid innovation in digital economy markets and technologies coupled with an expansion of IP rights and increase in patents grants and their width. This has a knock-on effect on the application of the competition rules as a second-tier regulator of IP rights. However, the competition rules also face its own battle in keeping up with the fast-developing digital economy, the concerns regarding Big Data and online platforms raising questions about the sustainability of the 'consumer welfare' framework as an optimal standard to ensure effective competition in these markets. Consequently, there is a danger that the competition rules and the IP rights will be out of quilter, risking stifling of innovation and harm to consumer welfare, unless adjustment is made within the two legal spheres.",2019,Government & Law

Biologics are often produced in living systems. The living systems used to produce biologics are highly complex and could be sensitive to very minor changes in the manufacturing process. According to the guideline published by the European Medicines Agency, biosimilar products are similar, not identical, to the innovator products they seek to copy. Therefore, in developing a biosimilar, it is important to assess the similarity between it and the innovator product. In this article, we consider a two-arm, parallel design with a reference biological product and a biosimilar. Then, we construct a biosimilarity index for assessing the degree of similarity based on the tolerance limits. The acceptance criterion is proposed to judge whether the biosimilar is similar to the reference product. We also address the determination of the number of subjects to ensure that the occurring probability of biosimilarity criterion is maintained at a desired level, say 80% or 90%.

In the field of biomaterials these challenges manifest themselves at every step of the commercialization process. As the understanding of the mechanobiologic relationship in tissue engineering has progressed, there is greater emphasis being placed on the engineering of specific properties into new biomaterials. During this early development, intellectual property is a critical factor in determining commercial feasibility as patent protection establishes the property lines around the technology and helps define future market segments. Once developed, a new biomaterial then enters the next series of challenges including commercial-scale manufacturing and addressing regulatory concerns. Synthesis of the biomaterial must be economically and technically scalable to meet market demands and the new biomaterial must be designed to stand up to regulatory scrutiny with regards to safety and efficacy. However daunting, a robust understanding of the design elements and the commercial requirements will aid the researcher in overcoming the challenges of bringing a new biomaterial to the market.

Transcarotid Approach for Retrograde Stenting of Proximal Innominate and Common Carotid Artery Stenosis,; AORTIC-ARCH; CEREBRAL PROTECTION; DISEASE; ENDARTERECTOMY; LESIONS; ANGIOPLASTY; EXPERIENCE; BRANCHES; THERAPY; VESSELS,"Background: To evaluate the hybrid treatment of severe stenosis or occlusion of the proximal innominate artery (IA) and common carotid artery (CCA) via surgical cutdown of the CCA and distal clamping for cerebral protection against thromboembolic events during retrograde stenting. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing retrograde stenting of proximal IA and CCA stenosis or occlusion via surgical cutdown of the CCA and with distal clamping for prevention of embolization, with or without concomitant endarterectomy of the carotid bifurcation, between April 1999 and August 2015 were reviewed. Perioperative and long-term outcomes were assessed. Results: Thirty-five patients underwent a total of 36 successful interventions. One patient underwent staged bilateral stenting. Additional concomitant carotid endarterectomy was performed in 13 patients (36%). No new neurological symptoms neither perioperatively nor in-hospital were recorded. Thirty-day follow-up revealed 1 new ipsilateral and 1 new contralateral stroke (6%) with completely patent stents, no reinterventions, and 2 unrelated deaths (6%). Median follow-up was 56 months (range: 1-197). After 5 and 10 years, the Kaplan-Meier estimated overall survival rate was 85% and 52%. Primary assisted patency rate was 94% during follow-up. Overall freedom from reintervention was 91%. Three reinterventions were performed during the first postoperative year. Three new neurological events occurred during follow-up, 1 ipsilateral (3%) and 2 contralateral (6%). The ipsilateral event occurred during the first year and both contralateral events during the second year postoperatively. Conclusions: The retrograde hybrid approach to proximal IA and CCA disease is a safe procedure with surgical outflow control preventing perioperative stroke in ipsilateral carotid territory. Most relevant in-stent stenoses/occlusions and new neurological events occurred within the first 2 years, suggesting these patients should undergo regular monitoring early postoperatively. High patency rates without further neurological events can be expected thereafter.",2017,Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Addition of histamine to subcutaneously injected Plasmodium berghei sporozoites increases the parasite liver load and could facilitate whole-parasite vaccination,Histamine; Heparin; Sporozoite; SPZ; Chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites; Whole-parasite immunization; Malaria vaccine; MALARIA; IMMUNIZATION; DIHYDROCHLORIDE; PROTECTION; INTERLEUKIN-2; IMMUNITY; STAGE; MICE,"Background: Whole-parasite immunization remains the benchmark in malaria vaccine development. A major bottleneck in the translation of whole-parasite immunization towards routine vaccination is the mode of administration, since high degrees of protection are currently only achieved by intravenous, and not by intradermal or subcutaneous injection of viable parasites. It is known that only a small proportion of subcutaneously administered parasites reach the subsequent liver stage and low parasite liver load was shown to be associated with low protective efficacy. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate whether the liver load following subcutaneous parasite injection could be augmented by co-administration of pro-inflammatory or anti-coagulatory drugs. Methods: In the C57BL/6 Plasmodium berghei ANKA model, the clinical outcome (time to patent blood stage infection and survival) and relative parasite liver load was assessed in mice infected by subcutaneous or intramuscular sporozoite (SPZ) administration in the presence or absence of histamine and heparin supplementation in comparison to intravenously administered SPZ. In addition, a vaccination experiment was carried out to assess the protective efficacy of an improved, histamine-supplemented subcutaneous immunization regimen. Results: The parasite liver load following subcutaneous SPZ administration can be significantly increased by co-administration of histamine and heparin. A dose-dependent relation between parasite liver load and histamine dosage was observed. However, despite a relatively high parasite liver load, the protective efficacy of histamine-supplemented subcutaneous immunization remains inferior as compared to intravenous SPZ administration. Conclusions: Histamine supplementation might facilitate the future development of a non-intravenous whole-parasite vaccine. Further investigations are needed to reveal the effect of histamine supplementation and subcutaneous SPZ administration on the acquisition of protective immunity.",2015,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine

The purpose of the study was to confirm clinically the experimentally obtained results to protect the receptor apparatus of the teeth by using the antihomotoxic drug combined with the domestic light-curing adhesive. Materials and methods. The method was tested in 72 patients, of whom 57 were the main group and 15 were controls. They were divided into 3 subgroups by age. A total of 200 teeth were prepared for one-piece cast fixed implant-supported prostheses. Electro-odontometry (EO) was performed and masticatory force (MF) was measured by the proposed method (patent number 99095142 dated September 16, 1999) before the preparation, when an anesthetic was worn off and one month after preparation. Results. The positive results of our method were clinically confirmed by the EO data analysis and the MF values measured by proposed by us method on the day of the study, the next day, in a month after the intact teeth were coated with the proposed complex of preparations. Men assessing the data obtained, it was found that there were no significant changes in the EO indices as well as MF indicators on the day of the examination, the next day, in a month after the examination in the study group compared with the control. Conclusions. Analyzing the results obtained, it can be noted that our method has a significant advantage in protecting the stumps during teeth preparation at the stages of treatment with non-removable prosthesis design and contributes to preventing complications of the hard dental tissue preparation.",2019,General & Internal Medicine

Tens of them have had attempted protection by patent applications but none, as far as we are aware, have found application under real agricultural conditions. The reasons behind may be multiple where the sensitivity to the Sun UV radiation can come in first place. Here we describe a multifunctional glyco-oligomer with 210 kDa which is mainly composed by a 20 kDa polypeptide termed Blad that has been previously shown to be a stable intermediary product of beta-conglutin catabolism. This oligomer accumulates exclusively in the cotyledons of Lupinus species, between days 4 and 12 after the onset of germination. Blad-oligomer reveals a plethora of biochemical properties, like lectin and catalytic activities, which are not unusual per si, but are remarkable when found to coexist in the same protein molecule. With this vast range of chemical characteristics, antifungal activity arises almost as a natural consequence. The biological significance and potential technological applications of Blad-oligomer as a plant fungicide to agriculture, its uniqueness stems from being of polypeptidic in nature, and with efficacies which are either equal or greater than the top fungicides currently in the market are addressed.",2015,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Using export data, this paper aims at assessing the relative impact of TRIPs on innovation, namely the ability of the Indian pharmaceutical industry to enter new markets with existing or new drugs. It examines whether India's decision to comply with TRIPS influenced its innovation, and develops a theoretical model, where innovation, being measured by the likelihood of exports of one product from one identified country to partner countries, is influenced by factor, demand and trade conditions. The paper draws on quantitative data, using Probit and Logit techniques. The model is illustrated using empirical evidence from the Indian pharmaceutical industry. We find statistically significant evidence that India's compliance with TRIPS is associated with new trade flows from India to partners. However we do not find statistically significant evidence of a relation between TRIPS compliance and value of exports. The interpretation is that TRIPS compliance has different effects: it is a necessary condition to favor innovation but it is not sufficient to increase exports value (competitiveness). Finally, we study to what extent this model can be generalized to other developing countries and/or industries.

Discovery of a drug targeting microenvironmental support for lymphoma cells by screening using patient-derived xenograft cells,; LUNG-CANCER; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; KINASE; RESISTANCE; LEUKEMIA; GROWTH; MOUSE; MODEL,"Cell lines have been used for drug discovery as useful models of cancers; however, they do not recapitulate cancers faithfully, especially in the points of rapid growth rate and microenvironment independency. Consequently, the majority of conventional anti-cancer drugs are less sensitive to slow growing cells and do not target microenvironmental support, although most primary cancer cells grow slower than cell lines and depend on microenvironmental support. Here, we developed a novel high throughput drug screening system using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells of lymphoma that maintained primary cancer cell phenotype more than cell lines. The library containing 2613 known pharmacologically active substance and off-patent drugs were screened by this system. We could find many compounds showing higher cytotoxicity than conventional anti-tumor drugs. Especially, pyruvinium pamoate showed the highest activity and its strong anti-tumor effect was confirmed also in vivo. We extensively investigated its mechanism of action and found that it inhibited glutathione supply from stromal cells to lymphoma cells, implying the importance of the stromal protection from oxidative stress for lymphoma cell survival and a new therapeutic strategy for lymphoma. Our system introduces a primary cancer cell phenotype into cell-based phenotype screening and sheds new light on anti-cancer drug development.",2015,Science & Technology - Other Topics
Hemoglobin variants shape the distribution of malaria parasites in human populations and their transmission potential,; SICKLE-CELL TRAIT; FALCIPARUM-INFECTED ERYTHROCYTES; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; PROTECTION; MOSQUITOS; CHILDREN,"Hemoglobin variants C and S protect against severe malaria but their influence on parameters not directly linked to disease severity such as gametocyte carriage and infection chronicity is less well understood. To assess whether these infection-related phenotypes depend on the host hemoglobin genotype, we followed 500 Malian individuals over 1-2 years and determined their parasitological status during monthly visits and incidental clinical episodes. While adults heterozygous for hemoglobin S mutation were less often parasitemic compared to AA adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.50 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.79, P = 0.003), schoolchildren (but not toddlers or adults) with AC genotype carried parasites, including gametocytes, more often than their AA counterparts (OR 3.01 95% CI 1.38-6.57, P = 0.006). AC children were also likelier to be parasite-positive during the dry season, suggesting longer infections, and were more infectious in mosquito skin feeding assays than AA children. Notably, AC school-aged children, who comprise similar to 5% of the population, harbor a third of infections with patent gametocytes between May and August, when transmission transitions from very low to intense. These findings indicate that schoolchildren with hemoglobin C mutation might contribute disproportionately to the seasonal malaria resurgence in parts of West Africa where the HbC variant is common.",2017,Science & Technology - Other Topics
A Framework for Development of Useful Metabolomic Biomarkers and Their Effective Knowledge Translation,metabolomics; biomarkers; knowledge translation; EXTERNAL VALIDATION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; MS; TRANSCRIPTOMICS; DIAGNOSTICS; PHASES; SERUM,"Despite the significant advantages of metabolomic biomarkers, no diagnostic tests based on metabolomics have been introduced to clinical use. There are many reasons for this, centered around substantial obstacles in developing clinically useful metabolomic biomarkers. Most significant is the need for interdisciplinary teams with expertise in metabolomics, analysis of complex clinical and metabolomic data, and clinical care. Importantly, the clinical need must precede biomarker discovery, and the experimental design for discovery and validation must reflect the purpose of the biomarker. Standard operating procedures for procuring and handling samples must be developed from the beginning, to ensure experimental integrity. Assay design is another challenge, as there is not much precedent informing this. Another obstacle is that it is not yet clear how to protect any intellectual property related to metabolomic biomarkers. Viewing a metabolomic biomarker as a natural phenomenon would inhibit patent protection and potentially stifle commercial interest. However, demonstrating that a metabolomic biomarker is actually a derivative of a natural phenomenon that requires innovation would enhance investment in this field. Finally, effective knowledge translation strategies must be implemented, which will require engagement with end users (clinicians and lab physicians), patient advocate groups, policy makers, and payer organizations. Addressing each of these issues comprises the framework for introducing a metabolomic biomarker to practice.",2018,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology

This paper tests the variables that may affect the ability of green innovation by using the Granger causality test. It extracts the variables passed the test as input variables, selects the number of patents as output variable, and evaluates the efficiency of various provinces in mainland China by examining their yearly technological progress variables. At the same time, technological progress is defined and divided into capital and environmental factors, and then panel data using the variable coefficients model was used to fit influencing factors to obtain impact coefficients of capital and environment. On this basis, this paper makes the determination of membership to replace the general sense of 'threshold' value by using fuzzy theory and proposes the concept of the 'comprehensive threshold' of economic development and environmental protection. The results show that less than a quarter of China's provinces have crossed the comprehensive threshold. Finally, based on the conclusions of quantitative analysis, some suggestions are proposed that the Chinese government ought to enact different strategies for the introduction of FDI according to different development situations of different provinces.",2015,Operations Research & Management Science

To identify inhibitors against human pathogenic fungi, we screened similar to 3000 compounds provided by the Developmental Therapeutics Program of NIH/NCI against a panel of pathogenic fungi including Candida species, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans. NSC319726 (a thiosemicarbazone) had broad antifungal activity in the range of 0.1-2.0 mu g/ml and was also inhibitory to fluconazole-resistant isolates of Candida species. Synergy was demonstrated with NSC319726 and azoles, as well as caspofungin. The inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) of NSC319726 was 35-800-fold higher than the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration 50% (MIC50 values), which indicates low compound toxicity to human cells in vitro. Transcriptome analysis of treated and untreated C. albicans using Gene Ontology (GO) revealed a large cluster of down regulated genes that encode translational proteins, especially those with ribosome biogenesis functions. As NSC319726 was first shown to have anti-cancer activity, its affects against human pathogenic fungi establish NSC319726 as a repurposed, off-patent compound that has potential antifungal activity. The minimal in vitro toxicity of lead optimized NSC319726 and its reasonable inhibitory activity against pathogens suggest advancing this compound to in vivo toxicity testing and protection studies against candidiasis.",2017,Science & Technology - Other Topics

In this work we enabled identification of the inks that contain these hazardous substances by developing a new method for the analysis of BPA and BFN in thermochromic printing inks. The method is based on the reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) with UV detection at 226 and 254nm. Ultrasound-assisted sample extraction in methanol was proven to be the most suitable and effective among several other solvents. The method was completely validated with satisfactory results. The specificity of the method was proven by the additional LC-tandem mass spectrometry analysis.

They developed the key hypothesis on foreign market entry through CBAs by incorporating insights from transaction costs economics, the resource-based view and institutional theory to investigate the determinants of full versus partial equity ownership. Using logistic regression estimation methods to a sample of 111 CBA deals of BRICS MNEs in 22 European countries, it was found that BRICS MNEs were likely to pursue full rather than partial acquisition mode when target firms have high R&D capabilities. However, the greater the degree of strength of IP institutions in target economies and higher the target firms' R&D capabilities, the more likely it is for BRICS MNEs to undertake partial, rather than, full acquisition mode. They provided interesting theoretical insights and managerial implications that might underlie some of the key findings on CBAs by emerging market MNEs.",2018,Business & Economics
Challenging the Use of Special 301 against Measures Promoting Access to Medicines: Options Under the WTO Agreements,; ,"In April 2014, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) listed India on its Special 301 Priority Watch List, following India's refusal to grant a patent over the leukaemia drug Gleevec and its compulsory licensing of the cancer drug Nexavar. USTR also undertook an out-of-cycle review of India's intellectual property laws, to determine whether or not to upgrade India to the more serious Priority Foreign Country status, which would potentially trigger retaliation through withdrawal of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) benefits. In response, India threatened to take the USA to the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Dispute Settlement Body over Special 301. This article examines whether such a challenge to Special 301 in the WTO would succeed, both in the India context and more generally. It takes three lines of inquiry. The first is whether or not the Special 301 procedure violates the procedural obligations under Article 23 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). The second is whether or not any related withdrawal of GSP benefits would be in line with the Enabling Clause. Finally, the article examines whether there are substantive limitations on intellectual property protections under TRIPS which could be used to challenge the validity of Special 301.

The five parental populations that had been exposed to Ethyl MethaneSulfonate in 1997 or 2002 were initially screened for either herbicide tolerance or divergent fiber quality. Fatty acid composition were determined for five seed bulks from 140 M-5 mutant lines in 2009 and 100 M-6 partial seeds in 2010. Mutants with reduced levels of palmitic acid levels were isolated from TAM 94L-25 (PI 631440), Acala 1517-99 (Reg. No. CV-115, PI 612326) and TTU SCM3-7-3 (Reg. No.GS-4, PI 657942). Thirteen M-6 single seeds with reduced levels of palmitic acid (17.9-19.6%) were intercrossed in the greenhouse. Ten of the single seed selections were designated as potential male parents and randomly crossed to three potential female parents to generate F-1 plants and 21 F-2 populations for allele testing. Based on these tests, five F-2 populations with reduced levels of low palmitic acid, were selected for further evaluation. The development of mutant lines with reduced levels of palmitic acid in upland cotton was submitted for proprietary protection under U.S. Patent No. 20160222399.",2019,Agriculture; Plant Sciences

As a result, multiple biosimilar mAbs are becoming available for a single originator drug. As opposed to small-molecular drugs, protein biopharmaceuticals do not have fully defined and reproducible structures, making it impossible to create identical copies. Therefore, regulators demand biosimilar sponsors to demonstrate similarity with the reference product to prevent safety and efficacy issues with the proposed product. Protein glycosylation is considered a crucially important quality attribute, because of its major role in immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of therapeutic proteins. However, the intrinsic biological variability of glycan structures creates a significant challenge for the current analytical platforms. In this review, we discuss the importance of glycan characterization on therapeutic proteins, with a particular focus on the analytical techniques applied for glycan profiling of biosimilar mAb products. In addition, we present a case study on infliximab biosimilars to illustrate the potential clinical implications of differences in glycan profile between originator and biosimilar mAb products.

In contrast, mice infected with Plasmodium develop sterilizing immunity, hindering progress in understanding the mechanistic basis of clinical immunity. Here we present a novel model in which mice persistently infected with P. chabaudi exhibit limited clinical symptoms despite sustaining patent parasite burdens for many months. Characterization of immune responses in persistently infected mice revealed development of CD4(+) T cell exhaustion, increased production of IL-10, and expansion of B cells with an atypical surface phenotype. Additionally, persistently infected mice displayed a dramatic increase in circulating nonclassical monocytes, a phenomenon that we also observed in humans with both chronic Plasmodium exposure and asymptomatic infection. Following pharmacological clearance of infection, previously persistently infected mice could not control a secondary challenge, indicating that persistent infection disrupts the sterilizing immunity that typically develops in mouse models of acute infection. This study establishes an animal model of asymptomatic, persistent Plasmodium infection that recapitulates several central aspects of the immune response in chronically exposed humans. As such, it provides a novel tool for dissection of immune responses that may prevent development of sterilizing immunity and limit pathology during infection.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics

We investigate if IPRs have a differential effect across sectors of different technology content and for countries of different development level. Also, we study how imitation abilities of target countries interact with the tightening of IPRs. Using data for the post-TRIPS period (1995-2010), we estimate an extended gravity model to study the bilateral number of M&As, including a measure of the strength of IPRs systems on target countries and a set of control variables usually considered as determinants of M&As. The estimation results verify the gravity structure for M&As and show that IPRs -and enforcement- influence decisions of cross-border M&As in all sectors regardless of their technological content. However, IPRs are more important in countries with high imitation abilities and in sectors of high-technology content. Furthermore, a strengthening of IPRs leads to a larger increase of M&As in developing countries than in developed countries. These results call the attention on the possible implications for least developed economies and challenge the adequacy of a globally harmonized IPRs systems.",2019,Business & Economics
On being an expert witness in sexual and reproductive health,; ,"A new generation of expert witnesses in sexual and reproductive health is needed, including those in nursing as well as medical roles. Being an expert witness is a significant commitment alongside clinical work. Nevertheless, the work is stimulating and rewarding. Training is essential before starting medicolegal work. In particular expert witnesses need to be able to apply appropriate legal tests to the evidence, to deal with the range of expert opinion on a matter, and explain clearly what constitutes an appropriate standard of care for a clinician in their discipline and specialty. Expert witnesses must be aware of pitfalls such as being sued for substandard work and being reported to their professional regulator for straying outside their area of expertise. Expert witnesses must be truly independent and ideally their reports should be the same whoever they receive their instructions from. In addition to report writing, expert witnesses are required to comment on court documents, participate in conferences with a barrister and hold formal discussions with an opposing expert witness. Expert witnesses need to be administratively efficient and responsive. Although appearance in court is not that common, this is an essential part of the role. Apart from litigation in the civil courts, other types of case may present themselves including patent cases, work in the Court of Protection and health professionals' Fitness to Practise hearings.",2017,Family Studies; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Biomedical Social Sciences

The first generation analyzes the origins of new intellectual property rules, in particular the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and the significance of TRIPS to developing countries. The second generation examines national-level experiences, as countries adjust their laws and practices to conform to TRIPS. Based on the insights provided by the articles in the special issue, we contribute to the second generation by considering a pair of overarching sets of issues. First, we highlight the domestic political challenges that affect how countries go about implementing their new obligations under TRIPS. We argue that alliances and coalitions are necessary to underpin the use of policy instruments designed to conform to TRIPS while taking into account local conditions and needs, and we present insights that allow us to understand why alliances and coalitions are difficult to construct and sustain in this area. Second, we explain why policies that many countries adopt in response to TRIPS often do not generate their desired or intended outcomes.

However, continuous efforts have been committed to develop powerful antimalarial vaccine by discovery of novel antigens with in-depth understanding of its nature, immunogenicity, and presentation (delivery adjuvants). Moreover, another important part of vaccine development includes discovery of better immunostimulatory formulation components (immunostimulants). A protective vaccine against malaria requires antigen-specific B and T helper cell responses as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. A long-lasting B and T memory cell production is also required for effective malaria vaccine. Since activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) promotes both innate inflammatory responses as well as the induction of adaptive immunity, several initiatives have been mounted during the last few years for the use of TLR agonists as malaria vaccine adjuvants. Areas covered: The review summarizes reports related to the use and development of TLR agonists as malaria vaccine adjuvants and describes various strategies involved for the selection of specific antigens and TLR agonists. Expert opinion: TLR agonists are promising adjuvants for the development of effective malaria vaccine, allowing for both innate inflammatory responses as well as the induction of adaptive immunity.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Contractual governance and the choice of dispute-resolution mechanisms: Evidence on technology licensing,Arbitration; Technology licensing; Contract design; Dispute; INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; TRANSACTION COSTS; APPROPRIATION CONCERNS; COORDINATION COSTS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PATENT PROTECTION; FORMAL CONTRACTS; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; JOINT VENTURES; ARBITRATION,"In fast-paced and knowledge-intensive environments, licensing partnerships can be powerful levers for market expansion. Research on the management of technology-oriented licenses has nonetheless pointed out the risks of corrosive disputes caused by conflicting interests or misunderstandings among licensing partners. The choice made ex ante on mechanisms for resolving potential disputes is of prime importance in the execution of licensing exchanges. Although the legal literature has widely emphasized the advantages of arbitration towards litigation, public ordering remains the default option in managers' eyes. By adopting a transaction cost economics logic, our study explores the conditions under which licensing partners may prefer arbitration over public ordering during the contractual-design phase. In accordance with our theoretical arguments, findings show that the occurrence of arbitration provisions increases when the coordination orientation adopted by licensing partners is extensive. In situations where both monitoring and coordination orientations are simultaneously extensive, results reveal a greater propensity to prefer arbitration over public ordering. Our research therefore supports the view that corporate decision-makers tend to favor the conciliatory stance and compromising awards typically associated with arbitration, only when exchanges are expected to be highly coordinative. Their preference for arbitration over litigation is magnified when the coordination orientation develops alongside the monitoring orientation.",2018,Business & Economics
Pranlukast (Onon) An Anti-asthmatic Drug Realized by Intensive Investment in the Arachidonic Acidcascade,; ,"Pranlukast hydrate (Onon) was the world's first cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptor antagonist andwas developed by Ono Pharmaceutical. The innovation of pranlukast is summarized by its provision of an oral agent with high efficacy against bronchial asthma, and its novel mechanism of action. The case of pranlukast development has the following implications. The first is the importance of the contribution of the underlying scientific knowledge to the development of a drug with a novel mechanism of action, particularly at the conceptualization stage of the project. In the case of pranlukast, the discovery of leukotrienes was the contributing factor. The second is the importance of accumulating drug development experience. Such development of expertise allowed Ono Pharmaceutical to discover such a promising compound ahead of other companies located around the globe that were also in competition to develop an LT antagonist. Pranlukast was the first antagonist of CysLT receptors to be developed and became a highly successful drug in Japan with annual sales of tens of billions of yen. However, the third LT antagonist, montelukast (Singulair), has recorded far greater sales than pranlukast globally. These facts provide two additional insights into a market competition of the pharmaceutical industry. The first is related to patent protection and the subsequent entries into the market. The second is the importance of complementary assets in market competition.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Effects of economic development in China on skill-biased technical change in the US,Economic growth; Skill-biased technical change; Offshoring; PATENT PROTECTION; INNOVATION; GROWTH; TASKS; MODEL,"In this study, we explore the effects of a change in unskilled labor in China on the direction of innovation in the US by incorporating production offshoring into a North-South model of directed technical change. We find that intellectual property rights (IPRs) and offshoring are different ways for the labor endowment of the South to affect the size of the market for innovations in the North. Absent offshoring and lacking IPRs in the South - as in China in the early 1980s - an increase in Southern unskilled labor should lead to skill-biased technical change. If instead offshoring is present and/or IPRs are better enforced (as in China in more recent times), then a decrease in unskilled labor in the South should lead to skill-biased technical change. Furthermore, an increase in Southern per capita stock of capital reduces offshoring and also leads to skill-biased technical change. Calibrating the model to China-US data, we find that under a moderate elasticity of substitution between skill-intensive and labor-intensive goods, the decrease in unskilled labor and the increase in capital in China can explain about one-third of the recent increase in the skill premium in China through skill-biased technical change in the US.

Unravelling appropriability mechanisms and openness depth effects on firm performance across stages in the innovation process,Extemal search; Openness; Types of partners; Depth of collaboration; Appropriability mechanisms; Intellectual property protection mechanisms; Paradox of disclosure; Innovation performance; Novelty; Efficiency; Exploration; Exploitation; Innovation phases; INFORMAL APPROPRIATION MECHANISMS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE; DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION; INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT; SEARCH; SMES; GOVERNANCE,"There is to date abundant evidence about the way openness-performance liaisons are shaped, yet parallel streams of research point towards an intricate relationship between appropriability and openness. Accordingly, while openness may reveal ample opportunities, risks of e.g. misappropriation should also be accounted for in open innovation processes, as they might affect performance. Recent research highlights the scarcity of studies investigating openness, appropriability and performance, and suggests a further need to analyze this in different stages of the innovation process. This study therefore aims to investigate the effects of three groups of intellectual property protection mechanisms (formal, semi-formal and informal) and openness (in terms of collaboration depth with eight types of partners) on two types of innovation performance (efficiency and novelty) across innovation phases. The analysis is based on a sample of 340 manufacturing firms from three European countries. Findings show that in early stages of the innovation process, efficiency is positively linked to the use of semi-formal appropriability mechanisms, such as contracts, yet negatively related to the use of formal ones, such as patents. The latter potentially illustrates the high uncertainty and increased risks of imitation or misappropriation in early innovation phases. Informal appropriability mechanisms contribute to novelty in earlier as well as later stages. Results further indicate novelty is explained by university collaboration throughout the innovation process, while competitor collaboration positively associates with novelty in later innovation stages. Vertical collaborations with supplier and customers reveal contrasting effects, which could also have implications linked to imitation risks. Furthermore, the negative effects of formal appropriability mechanisms and supplier collaboration on innovation performance in distinct stages of the innovation process might have implications for the socalled paradox of disclosure.

Panax Notoginseng Saponins Protect Cardiac Myocytes Against Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Associated Apoptosis Through Mediation of Intracellular Calcium Homeostasis,Panax notoginseng saponins; endoplasmic reticulum stress; apoptosis; intracellular calcium homeostasis; ryanodine receptor; CHANNEL RYANODINE RECEPTOR; ER STRESS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; HEART-FAILURE; CELL-DEATH; PATHWAY; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; PHOSPHORYLATION; THAPSIGARGIN; INFLAMMATION,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been demonstrated to play important roles in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. The ER stress pathway is therefore a promising therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease. Although Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are one of the patent medicines that are traditionally used to treat cardiovascular disorders, their effects on ER stress in cardiac myocytes remain unexploited so far. This study investigates the effects of PNS on ER stress and its associated cell apoptosis along with the related mechanism in cardiac myocytes. PNS compounds were identified via high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) assay. PNS-pretreated H9c2 cells, HL-1 cells, and primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were stimulated with thapsigargin (TG) to induce ER stress response and apoptosis. ER stress response was tested by immunofluorescence or immunoblot of the ER protein chaperones-calnexin, binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Cell viability was tested by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by immunoblot of Cleaved caspase-3 and flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Cytosolic, mitochondrial, and ER calcium dynamics were investigated by calcium imaging. Moreover, a ryanodine receptor type-2 (RyR(2)) overexpression stable cell line was generated to verify the mechanism of RyR(2) involved in PNS in the inhibition of ER stress and cell apoptosis. We demonstrate here that PNS protected cardiac myocytes from ER stress response and associated cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, PNS reduced the elevation of cytosolic calcium, mitochondria calcium, as well as ER calcium in response to either TG or histamine treatment. PNS protection in ER stress was regulated by RyR(2) expression. In summary, PNS protection against TG-induced ER stress response and its associated cell apoptosis in cardiac myocytes is calcium dependent. Through the regulation of ER calcium release mediated by RyR(2), a novel mechanism for PNS in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases is thereby identified.",2019,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

GlaxoSmithKline and Theravance have developed an inhaled FDC of the ICS fluticasone furoate (FF) and the LABA vilanterol (VI) as a once-daily treatment for asthma and COPD. FF/VI, by simplifying the dosing schedule, allows, for the first time, a shift from twice-daily to once-daily treatment, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile that is consistent with the ICS/LABA class. The decision to prescribe FF/VI rather than another ICS/LABA FDC is likely to be based on the patient's preference for the inhaler device, their ability to use the device correctly and the convenience of once-daily dosing frequency as well as comparative costs with other combination products. However, further studies are required to specifically assess these possibilities.",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Metacercariae were gamma-irradiated and the ability of irradiated metacercariae to prevent patent infection of challenge metacercariae in hamsters was determined, as well as their ability to induce a host antibody response. Metacercariae irradiated in a dose-dependent manner, with 3, 5, 10, 12, 20, 25 and 50 Gray, were used to infect Syrian golden hamsters by stomach gavage to ascertain the effect of irradiation on ability of the worms to establish infection. In addition, other hamsters were infected with metacercariae irradiated with 20-50 Gray, followed by challenge with intact/wild-type (non-irradiated) metacercariae to determine the protective effect as established by the numbers of adult flukes, eggs of O. viverrini in hamster faeces and anti-O. viverrini antibody titres. Significantly fewer worms were recovered from hamsters immunized with metacercariae irradiated at 20, 25 and 50 Gray than from control hamsters infected with intact metacercariae or 0 Gray, and the worms showed damaged reproductive organs. Faecal egg numbers were decreased significantly in hamsters immunized with 25 and 50 Gray metacercariae of O. viverrini. Moreover, hamsters administered metacercariae that were protected elicited a robust, specific anti-fluke immunoglobulin G response compared to control hamsters, suggesting a role for antibody in protection elicited by radiation-attenuated metacercariae.",2016,Parasitology; Zoology

Hysteretic dampers have the role of dissipating most of the energy input of an earthquake. Minor or moderate earthquakes do not exhaust the energy dissipation capacity of the dampers, yet they damage them. For this reason, continuous or periodic damper-health evaluation is required to decide if they need to be replaced. Such evaluation calls for the application of efficient structural health monitoring techniques (SHM). This paper focuses on the well-known vibration technique, which is applied to a particular type of hysteretic damper called Web Plastifying Damper (WPD), patented by the University of Granada. Vibration signals, properly recorded by piezoelectric sensors attached around the damaged area of the dampers, are decomposed by means of wavelet packet analysis. Then, the relative wavelet energy entropy of these decompositions is used to calculate the proposed index. Validation of RWEE for this particular application involved dampers installed in two different specimens of reinforced concrete structures subjected to earthquake sequences of increasing intensity. When compared with a well-established mechanical energy-based damage index, results demonstrate that RWEE is a successful and low-cost technique for reliable in-situ monitoring of dampers.",2017,Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science; Physics
How Much Time Before Attempting Compulsory Licensing of Pharmaceuticals? A Non-parametric Event History Model With P-splines,compulsory licensing; compulsory licensing duration; event history model; PATENTED MEDICINES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ACCESS; CANADA; BRAZIL,"Compulsory licensing (CL), provided by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, enables countries, including high-income countries, to ensure the protection of public health in the context of stringent intellectual property regimes. This study investigated associations between the time to attempted CL and a series of factors at the drug and country level. We used a dataset of all attempted CL that occurred from 1995 to 2014, calculated the duration as the difference in years between the year of global marketing of a certain drug and the year of attempted CL in a certain country, and applied a nonparametric event history model. We found that the Doha Declaration was quite effective in shortening the time to attempted CL. Additionally, even though global justice movements have encouraged some countries to attempt CL for various medicines since 2012, the time to CL attempts in this period became significantly longer compared to those that occurred immediately after the Doha Declaration. Our findings show that the subject of CL has not successfully expanded to oncology medicines from HIV/AIDS medicines and that recently approved medicines are not yet subjects of CL. Furthermore, our duration model suggests a learning-by-doing effect in attempting CL: previous experience of CL not only triggers CL for the same drugs in other countries but also accelerates CL for other drugs within the country.",2019,Health Care Sciences & Services
"How Public Is the Public Domain? The Perpetual Protection of Inventions, Designs and Works by Trademarks",; LAW,"There are plenty of trademarks consisting of product shapes that effectively deter competition, although the original work or the invention giving the shape to the product (and to the trademark) is already in the public domain and should be free to be used by anyone. Trademark laws typically contain provisions declaring certain kinds of trademarks not protectable on the basis of absolute grounds for refusal. However, the legal practice reveals that these mechanisms within the trademark laws are not sufficient to safeguard the public domain. Companies frequently try to deter free competition by registering trademarks consisting of the shape of a product after they lose the exclusivity in the patent, industrial design or work that gave its value to the product and meanwhile belongs to the public domain. This problem occurs in particular in relation to popular inventions, but also to designs or characters of works that are of high commercial value. Not only in developing countries, courts seem to hesitate assessing an invention, design or work to be part of the public domain if the popularity and value of the product are significant. The most appropriate approach to solve this problem is to introduce an international mandatory regulation that overarches all intellectual property rights and explicitly safeguards the public domain. Such general principle in international law should particularly ensure that the free use of inventions, designs or works is not affected by trademarks once the underlying intellectual property right expires.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
"The influence of trapping agents on the antitumor efficacy of irinotecan liposomes: head-to-head comparison of ammonium sulfate, sulfobutylether--cyclodextrin and sucrose octasulfate",; LARGE UNILAMELLAR VESICLES; DOXORUBICIN; ENCAPSULATION; VINCRISTINE; GRADIENTS; RELEASE; LESSONS; AMINES; TUMOR,"Remote loading technology is an outstanding achievement in liposome-based drug delivery systems. Compared with conventional passive loading, remote loading technology exhibits unique superiority in terms of high drug loading efficiency, low leakage rate and adequate drug accumulation. In the intra-liposome aqueous phase, the counterion of the trapping agent can control the state of aggregation/crystallization of the drug-counterion salt, and thereby contribute to control the efficiency of remote loading. Herein, irinotecan (CPT-11)-loaded liposomes were developed using three trapping agents: ammonium sulfate (AS), sulfobutylether--cyclodextrin (SBE--CD) and sucrose octasulfate (SOS). The corresponding formulations were named as AS liposomal CPT-11, TEA-SBE--CD liposomal CPT-11 and TEA-SOS liposomal CPT-11, respectively. Cryo-transmission electron micrographs showed that bundles of CPT-11 fibers were gathered inside TEA-SOS liposomal CPT-11. Furthermore, compared with AS liposomal CPT-11 and TEA-SBE--CD liposomal CPT-11, TEA-SOS liposomal CPT-11 demonstrated slower drug release, prolonged circulation time and significantly improved antitumor efficiency. To avoid the protection of ONIVYDE (R)-related patents, a number of other liposomal CPT-11 formulations are under preclinical investigation or even in clinical trials. Our study gives new insights into the impact of the trapping agent on remote loading, and provides valuable information to evaluate the development of CPT-11 loaded liposomes.",2019,Materials Science

However, the potential protective effect of TMYXP on cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity has not been reported. Methods: The target proteins corresponding to compounds from Pharmmapper database, PubMed database and ChEMBL database were collected and construct a 'TMYXP-compound-target' network. DAVID database was used for annotation and enrichment pathways and String 9.1 database was used for analysis the protein-protein interaction. Cisplatin-induced rat cardiotoxicity model was established to verify the protective effects mechanism of TMYXP. Results: The target proteins corresponding to compounds from multiple databases were collected and construct a TCM-compound-target network to enriched pathways with high enrichment score. GO analysis and enrichment clusters point that response of oxidative stress is the main biological process of TMYXP, and Nrf2 signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway might be the key functional pathways. In vivo experiments, we proved that TMYXP improves anti-oxidative stress ability and reduce apoptosis through regulating Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and p38-MAPK pathway. Conclusion: The effects of TMYXP on regulate cardiomyocyte free radical balance and reduce apoptosis, making it possible as a drug candidate for platinum chemotherapeutic induced cardiac injury.",2018,Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Estrogen prevents high-glucose-induced damage of retinal ganglion cells via mitochondrial pathway,17 beta-Estradiolum; Retina ganglion cell; Mitochondrial pathway; OXIDATIVE STRESS; RECEPTOR; ABNORMALITIES; APOPTOSIS; DYSFUNCTION; PROTECTION; PROTEINS; BETA,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of acquired blindness in adults. Previous research has shown that the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells(RGCs) plays an important role in the initiation and development of diabetic retinopathy. The positive effect of estrogen on the nervous system is currently attracting increasing attention. In this study, we investigated whether17 beta-estradiolum (E2) has protective effects on RGCs in a high-glucose environment. The cell survival rates were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8, the apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were examined by immunofluorescence method, and the intracellular mitochondrial membrane potential was examined by confocal microscopy. The expression levels of cytochrome C, Bcl-2, and Bax were analyzed by Western blot method. The effect of estrogen receptor blocker tamoxifen on the RGCs was also evaluated. It was found that E2 stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduces intracellular ROS levels, up-regulates Bcl-2 expression, inhibits Bax expression, decreases the generation of cytochrome C, and finally reduces the apoptosis of RGC-5 cells in a high-glucose environment. These protective functions could be attributed to E2 receptors, which make E2 a prospective patent application candidate in the treatment of DR. Furthermore, when cells were pre-cultured with tamoxifen, we found that tamoxifen inhibited the shielding effects of E2. E2 has a broad application prospect in the treatment of DR.",2015,Ophthalmology

Pregabalin is a blockbuster pharmaceutical drug having broad therapeutic effects. Using induction time experiments in combination with the classical nucleation theory, we show that the ease of nucleation increases with solubility and water fraction of the solvent. Water was found to enhance both the kinetic and thermodynamic processes of forming a nuclei. As a result, larger clusters which represent the hydrate form were measured using dynamic light scattering in pure water. Once in the solid state, the hydrate form of pregabalin was found to be physically unstable, as it rapidly converted back into its anhydrate form, as rationalized using in-line Raman spectroscopy. Thus, the hydration and nucleation of pregabalin in solution is highly favored, as opposed to the solid-state situation, where the anhydrate is the stable form. Despite these differences, a solution-crystallization link could still be established in our work. Knowledge of the solution chemistry and structural landscape of pharmaceutical compounds is essential for the development of manufacturing routes and patent protections, and we foresee that the presented approach can be used to further reveal relationships among self-association in solution, crystallization, and hydration of a wide range of organic compounds.",2019,Chemistry; Crystallography; Materials Science

AA is a patented as a cytotoxic substance, and it exerts cytotoxicity against Hep3B, Hela and MCF-7 cell lines. However, pentacyclic triterpenoids also modulate the expression and transcriptional activities of Nrf2 and exert cytoprotective effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of AA on the doxorubicin (DXR)-induced organ toxicities and expression of the Nrf2. DXR toxicity was induced by a single intravenous injection of 65.75 mg/kg of DXR. Seven days pretreatment with AA at the doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o. significantly reverted the DXR-induced oxidative stress in heart, liver and kidney. The biochemical indicators of DXR toxicity including increased activities of serum creatinine kinase isoenzyme, transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase along with increased serum creatinine and serum blood urea nitrogen were normalised by AA. AA was also protected against the DXR-induced histological alterations including necrosis, hyaline degeneration and congestion in the heart; leukocytic inflammation, centrilobular necrosis, apoptosis and fatty changes in the liver; and necrosis and inflammation in the kidney. The protective effects of AA were dose dependent, and the 20 mg/kg dose exerted protection against the DXR toxicity by increasing Nrf2 protein expression.",2018,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Toxicology
Quantitative assessment of the impact of partially protective anti-schistosomiasis vaccines,; TRANSMISSION,"Background Mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel has been the intervention of choice against schistosomiasis but with limited success in interrupting the transmission. The development of anti-Schistosoma vaccines is underway. Our objective is to quantify the population-level impact of anti-Schistosoma vaccines when administered alone and in combination with mass drug administration (MDA) and determine factors in vaccine design and public health implementation that optimize vaccination role in schistosomiasis control and elimination. Methods and findings We developed a deterministic compartmental model simulation of schistosomiasis transmission in a high-risk Kenyan community, including stratification by age, parasite burden, and vaccination status. The modeled schistosomiasis vaccines differed in terms of vaccine duration of protection (durability) and three biological efficacies. These are vaccine susceptibility effect (SE) of reducing person's susceptibility to Schistosoma acquisition, vaccine mortality effect (ME) of reducing established worm burden and vaccine fecundity effect (FE) of reducing egg release by mature worms. We quantified the population-level impact of vaccination over two decades under diverse vaccination schemes (childhood vs. mass campaigns), with different age-targeting scenarios, different risk settings, and with combined intervention with MDA. We also assessed the sensitivity of our predictions to uncertainties in model parameters. Over two decades, our base case vaccine with 80% SE, FE, and ME efficacies, 10 years' durability, provided by mass vaccination every 10 years, reduced host prevalence, mean intensity, incidence, and patent snail prevalence to 31%, 20 eggs/10-ml sample/person, 0.87 worm/person-year, and 0.74%, from endemic-state values of 71%, 152, 3.3, and 0.98%, respectively. Lower impact was found when coverage did not encompass all potential contaminators, and childhood-only vaccination schemes showed delayed and lower impact. In lower prevalence settings, the base case vaccine generated a proportionately smaller impact. A substantially larger vaccine program effect was generated when MDA + mass vaccination was provided every 5 years, which could be achieved by an MDA-only program only if drug was offered annually. Vaccine impact on schistosomiasis transmission was sensitive to a number of parameters including vaccine efficacies, human contact rates with water, human density, patent snails' rate of patency and lifespan, and force of infection to snails. Conclusions To be successful a vaccine-based control strategy will need a moderately to highly effective formulation combined with early vaccination of potential contaminators and aggressive coverage in repeated rounds of mass vaccination. Compared to MDA-only program, vaccination combined with MDA accelerates and prolongs the impact by reducing the acquisition of new worms and reducing egg release from residual worms.",2017,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine

Post-registration, observational and registry studies of real-life use have largely supported the outcomes seen in registrational clinical trials. With the recent loss of exclusivity for the originator medicinal product in Europe, a number of biosimilar adalimumab molecules have been licensed for use in the same indications as the originator molecule across rheumatology, dermatology, gastroenterology and ophthalmology. Clinicians in these areas first gained experience with biosimilar infliximab, followed by etanercept and rituximab. However, adalimumab is likely to present unique challenges given the numbers of patients treated and the range of biosimilar adalimumab products available. The biosimilar approval pathway has an emphasis on the pre-clinical analytic data in combination with clinical studies conducted to confirm therapeutic equivalence. To date, several adalimumab biosimilars have entered the EU market following successful marketing authorisation applications and recent expiration of originator patent protection. This overview covers the extent of use of adalimumab and summarises the regulatory process involved in the development of biosimilars as well as their use in clinical practice. The authors also discuss clinical data available so far on adalimumab biosimilars and their envisaged impact in the field of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.",2019,Oncology; Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Systematic development of a new hysteretic damper based on torsional yielding: part I-design and development,hysteretic damper; energy dissipation; passive control; seismic; torsion; SEISMIC-ISOLATED BRIDGES; GROUND-MOTION; PERFORMANCE,"Analytical and experimental studies into the behavior of a new hysteretic damper, designed for seismic protection of structures is presented in two papers. Although the subject matter of the papers is a specific system, they are also intended as an illustration of practical application of diverse engineering tools in systematic development of an anti-seismic product. The Multi-directional Torsional Hysteretic Damper (MTHD) is a recently patented invention in which a symmetrical arrangement of identical cylindrical steel energy dissipaters is configured to yield in torsion while the structure experiences planar movements due to earthquake shakings. The device has gone through many stages of design refinement, prototype verification tests and development of design guidelines and computer codes to facilitate its implementation in practice. The first of this two-part paper summarizes the development stages of the new system, conceptual and analytical. The experimental phase of the research is the focus of the accompanying paper. The new device has certain desirable properties. Notably, it is characterized by a variable and controllable-via-design or adaptive post-elastic stiffness. This feature gives the isolated structure the capability to evade the dominant period of the ground motion leading to reduced displacements while having force levels comparable to regular bilinear isolation systems. The device has already been applied to four major bridges. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2016,Engineering

Information on the morphology and genetic structure of apple offers significant help for germplasm maintenance and selection of suitable material to breed superior cultivars. This study shows the results of an investigation on the morphology and the genetic diversity for 19 apple cultivars, which are preserved in an ex situ collection in Naoussa, Central Macedonia, Greece. Information was recorded over a 5-year period for 47 traits describing plant morphology and phenotype, as well as leaf and fruit quality. Data were analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA) method. The Euclidean distance metric and the Ward's agglomeration method were used in an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of all cultivars. The cultivars were grouped into four main clusters, suggesting that the characterized apple collection has a high potential for specific breeding goals. Furthermore, the cultivars were genotyped using seven microsatellite primers. Moderate levels of polymorphism were detected, and 38 distinctive alleles (5.4 alleles per primer pair) were identified. Both multivariate clustering approach (phenotypic data) and the genetic distance clustering approach (genetic data) grouped the apple cultivars according to their type. Hence, these data could be used for protection or patenting processes of existing or new apple cultivars carried out by the EU-Community Plant Variety Office.",2018,Agriculture
Dynamics of Entrepreneurship in Egypt: Assessing the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Can Entrepreneurship Contribute to the Economic Development in Egypt?,Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship ecosystem; Emerging countries; Egypt; Middle East; Entrepreneurship Policy; Economic development; EMERGING ECONOMIES; BUSINESS OWNERSHIP; INNOVATION; GROWTH; POLICY,"The January 25th revolution in Egypt has inspired a spirit of motivation for youth to take matters into their hands and create their destiny. In less than 6 years the Egyptian Entrepreneurial Ecosystem (EE) managed to draw regional and global attention in terms of business support, funding, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and research. Tech-savvy and multi-lingual youth are the Egyptian EE's largest strength, and more constituents are joining the EE every hour. Despite the fact that more support services and stakeholders are emerging to promote entrepreneurship in Egypt, scattered efforts, uncoordinated initiatives, fragile legal framework and low-quality education do not seem to move the nascent ecosystem into a growth stage. Using a rigorous analysis, we conclude that the Egyptian EE is still at birth stage and most of its constituents are mostly fledgling organizations. The legal framework is inefficient. The market lacks genuine ideas and mentors. Venture capitalists still lack expertise, scientific research is not authoritative. Innovation infrastructure is underdeveloped, most of the patents are registered offshore, IP protection is practically inexistent. More worryingly the country is unable to retain its most qualified talents who immigrate to more robust innovation environments. To date, entrepreneurship in Egypt is unable to create sustainable employment or impact national economic growth. However, there is a significant opportunity for improvement. In this chapter we assess the Egyptian EE, then present a set of recommendations for policy makers and investors.",2018,Business & Economics

This study examines the antiretroviral (ARV) market characteristics for drugs procured and prescribed to Mexico's Social Protection System in Health beneficiaries between 2008 and 2013, and compares them with international data. Materials and methods. Procurement information from the National Center for the Prevention and the Control of HIV/AIDS was analyzed to estimate volumes and prices of key ARV. Annual costs were compared with data from the World Health Organization's Global Price Reporting Mechanism for similar countries. Finally, regimens reported in the ARV Drug Management, Logistics and Surveillance System database were reviewed to identify prescription trends and model ARV expenditures until 2018. Results. Results show that the first-line ARV market is concentrated among a small number of patented treatments, in which prescription is clinically adequate, but which prices are higher than those paid by similar countries.The current set of legal and structural options available to policy makers to bring prices down is extremely limited. Conclusions. Different negotiation policies were not successful to decrease ARV high prices in the public health market. The closed list approach had a good impact on prescription quality but was ineffective in reducing prices. The Coordinating Commission for Negotiating the Price of Medicines and other Health Supplies also failed to obtain adequate prices.To maximize purchase efficiency, policy makers should focus on finding long-term legal and political safeguards to counter the high prices imposed by pharmaceutical companies.",2015,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

DOLICHOSPERMUM; SUBUNIT ORGANIZATION,"Cyanobacteria possess a host of proteases which unlike heterotrophs do not take part in protein nutrition. Instead, they maintain homeostasis of several vital functions, namely photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, cellular assembly and disintegration, stress acclimation, and defense against predators. Herein, we review the Clp, FtsH, Deg/HtrA, Ctp, and SppA proteases, which under regular and photooxidative stress conditions maintain the integrity of photosynthetic and cytoplasmic membranes, periplasmic proteins, and photosystem particles, including the core complex protein, D1. The HetR protease by coordinating with the Alr3815 protease enables heterocyte differentiation and protection of nitrogenase from oxygen stress. The cell aggregation PteB proteases and caspases regulate the biomass density of cyanobacterial assemblages, and cyanophycinase mobilizes the reserve N, cyanophycin. Macrocyclization proteases mature up the ribosomally synthesized cyclic peptides of cyanobactin class with varied bioactivities. Numerous cyano-proteases listed in the UniProt database are homologues of eubacteria and higher plants with mostly unknown functions but with immense evolutionary significance in understanding the gene flow across bacteria and chloroplasts. Proteases are exclusive and therefore can be tailormade to customize peptide drug synthesis and to formulate food additives and antimalarial, antivirulence, and antithrombotic agents. Notwithstanding these opportunities, taxonomic inadequacy and lack of proper nomenclature have adversely affected different biotechnological application processes. As a remedy, we propose that polyphasic approach of classification and reassessment of old taxonomic status may be necessary before patenting/commercialization of biotechnological processes/products.",2019,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology
The Role of the Guangbao in Promoting Nationalism and Transmitting Reform Ideas in Late Qing China,; ,"The Guangbao, published in Guangzhou between 1886 and 1891, was one of China's earliest native-owned newspapers, with a circulation three times larger than the Xunhuan Ribao. The newspaper, founded by Kuang Qizhao, provides important information on the ideas that were circulating at the time in Guangzhou, a place where a number of reformers were beginning to formulate their thoughts. The newspaper may have sown some of the seeds for the nationalism that would become a powerful force after the Sino-Japanese War. The Guangbao protested against the mistreatment of overseas Chinese and printed stories recommending retaliation against Americans. It opposed Western imperialism, advocated a strong national defence, and even suggested annexing Korea. However, the newspaper was not xenophobic and tried to encourage good relations between Chinese and foreigners in China. Unlike future political newspapers, the Guangbao continued to support the existing political systemnot because of fear or ignorance, but because of a sense that democracy may not have been appropriate for China at this time. Although Kuang was not a supporter of many Neo-Confucian traditions or beliefs, because he equated Confucian morality with Christian morality, and morality was needed to combat corruption, the Guangbao emphasized Confucian moral training. The newspaper also served as a platform to promote reform ideas. Kuang carefully picked ideas that he felt were appropriate for China, including: free universal and specialized education, women's rights, economic nationalism/industrialization/business, free trade, entrepreneurship through patent and copyright protection, support for the common people versus corrupt officials, and philanthropy.",2017,Area Studies
Impact of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde-derived aroylhydrazones on the copper-catalyzed oxidation of the M112A PrP103-112 mutant fragment,Aroylhydrazones; Human prion protein; Copper(II); Methionine oxidation; Oxidative stress; PRION PROTEIN; METHIONINE OXIDATION; METAL-IONS; BINDING; IRON; COORDINATION; PARKINSONS; ALZHEIMERS; COMPLEXES; HYDRAZONE,"Misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) is known for its role in fatal neurodegenerative conditions, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. PrP fragments and their mutants represent important tools in the investigation of the neurotoxic mechanisms and in the evaluation of new compounds that can interfere with the processes involved in neuronal death. Metal-catalyzed oxidation of PrP has been implicated as a trigger for the conformational changes in protein structure, which, in turn, lead to misfolding. Targeting redox-active biometals copper and iron is relevant in the context of protection against the oxidation of biomolecules and the generation of oxidative stress, observed in several conditions and considered an event that might promote sporadic prion diseases as well as other neurodegenerative disorders. In this context, ortho-pyridine aroylhydrazones are of interest, as they can act as moderate tridentate ligands towards divalent metal ions such as copper(II). In the present work, we explore the potentiality of this chemical class as peptide protecting agents against the deleterious metal-catalyzed oxidation in the M112A mutant fragment of human PrP, which mimics relevant structural features that may play an important role in the neurotoxicity observed in prion pathologies. The compounds inhere studied, especially HPCFur, showed an improved stability in aqueous solution compared to our patented lead hydrazone INHHQ, displaying a very interesting protective effect toward the oxidation of methionine and histidine, processes that are related to both physiological and pathological aging.",2019,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry
Biosimilar uptake by British local formularies: a cross sectional study,Biosimilars; Biological medicines; Great Britain; Local formularies; THINK,"Background Biological medicines are starting to lose their patent protection, so similar, inexact copies (biosimilars) are being developed and licensed. The high acquisition costs of biologics for healthcare providers could be reduced by switching to biosimilars, thus alleviating budgetary pressures and increasing patient access. Therefore, the acceptance of biosimilars by prescribers in Great Britain (GB; England, Scotland, Wales) needs to be described and understood. Objective To determine uptake of the first wave of biosimilars (somatropin, epoetin, filgrastim) by local formularies (lists of preferred medicines for prescribing in local healthcare settings). Settings This study targeted local formularies in GB. Method In November 2014, local formularies (medicines formularies of Acute Trusts and Health Boards in GB) were screened for their approach to listing of biologics and their biosimilars as well as recommendations on usage of these pharmaceuticals. Main Outcomes Measures Listing frequencies of biosimilars. Results One hundred and forty-six British local formularies were screened. Amongst the 80% of formularies in which brand names were specified, biosimilar filgrastim was the most frequently listed when compared to the other targeted biosimilars. Biosimilars were listed in preference to reference biologic medicine in 49% of local formularies for filgrastim, 11% for somatropin and in only 6% for epoetin. Conclusion Although the market for biosimilars can act in parallel to the generic market, their uptake measured using local British formularies was less than what is expected given that the British market for medicines has a strong focus on generics. Finally, geographical variability within GB requires further investigation.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
A new oxidative stress marker for thiol-disulphide homeostasis in seasonal allergic rhinitis,; THIOL/DISULPHIDE HOMEOSTASIS; ASTHMA; CHILDREN; AIRWAYS; ASSOCIATION; GLUTATHIONE; SELENIUM; BALANCE; OXIDANT; ADULTS,"Background: Reactive oxygen species has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Reactive oxygen species has been effectively documented in patients with asthma, but very little research has been reported in subjects with allergic rhinitis. Objectives: To investigate thiol (SH)-disulfide (SS) homeostasis, a new oxidative stress marker present in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Methods: A total of 64 subjects, including 32 patients with SAR and 32 healthy controls, were included in the study. We measured the SH levels as a marker of antioxidant protection and SS as a marker related to oxidant stress. Sera specimens were taken from patients with SAR during exacerbation and during asymptomatic time periods. In addition, sera samples from the control group were also obtained during the pollen season to compare with those from patients with SAR. Results: In patients with SAR, during exacerbation periods, SH, SS, % SS/SH, % SS to total SH (TT), and % SH/TT were significantly different (p < 0.05) than in patients with SAR during asymptomatic periods. Although SS was significantly higher in patents with SAR during exacerbation periods, SH was significantly higher in patients with SAR during asymptomatic periods. Patients with SAR during asymptomatic periods and the control group did not significantly differ (p > 0.05) regarding SH, SS, TT, % SS/SH, % SS/TT, and % SH/TT. Conclusion: SAR is a disorder that elevates systemic oxidative stress and reduces antioxidant enzyme activities. Our results shed light on the etiopathogenesis of the disease and can help develop new therapeutic approaches.",2016,Otorhinolaryngology
Generic Substitution of Orphan Drugs for the Treatment of Rare Diseases: Exploring the Potential Challenges,; GASTROINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS; GAUCHER-DISEASE; 1ST; CHILDREN; BIOEQUIVALENCE; BIOSIMILARS; THERAPY; ISSUES; IMPACT; SAFETY,"Generic drugs are important components of measures introduced by healthcare regulatory authorities to reduce treatment costs. In most patients and conditions the switch from a branded drug to its generic counterpart is performed with no major complications. However, evidence from complex diseases suggests that generic substitution requires careful evaluation in some settings and that current bioequivalence criteria may not always be adequate for establishing the interchangeability of branded and generic products. Rare diseases, also called orphan diseases, are a group of heterogeneous diseases that share important characteristics: in addition to their scarcity, most are severe, chronic, highly debilitating, and often present in early childhood. Finding a treatment for a rare disease is challenging. Thanks to incentives that encourage research and development programs in rare diseases, several orphan drugs are currently available. The elevated cost of orphan drugs is a highly debated issue and a cause of limited access to treatment for many patients. As patent protection and the exclusivity period of several orphan drugs will expire soon, generic versions of orphan drugs should reach the market shortly, with great expectations about their impact on the economic burden of rare diseases. However, consistent with other complex diseases, generic substitution may require thoughtful considerations and may be even contraindicated in some rare conditions. This article provides an overview of rare disease characteristics, reviews reports of problematic generic substitution, and discusses why generic substitution of orphan drugs may be challenging and should be undertaken carefully in rare disease patients.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology

Even in low malaria transmission settings, such as the Amazon basin, where progress in malaria control has caused a remarkable reduction in case incidence, a recent increase in P. vivax transmission demonstrates the continued vulnerability of P. vivax-exposed populations. As part of a search for complementary approaches to P. vivax surveillance in areas in which adults are the majority of the exposed-population, here we evaluated the potential of serological markers covering a wide range of immunogenicity to estimate malaria transmission trends. For this, antibodies against leading P. vivax blood-stage vaccine candidates were assessed during a 9 year follow-up study among adults exposed to unstable malaria transmission in the Amazon rainforest. Circulating antibody levels against immunogenic P. vivax proteins, such as the Apical Membrane Antigen-1, were a sensitive measure of recent P. vivax exposure, while antibodies against less immunogenic proteins were indicative of naturally-acquired immunity, including the novel engineered Duffy binding protein II immunogen (DEKnull-2). Our results suggest that the robustness of serology to estimate trends in P. vivax malaria transmission will depend on the immunological background of the study population, and that for adult populations exposed to unstable P.vivax malaria transmission, the local heterogeneity of antibody responses should be considered when considering use of serological surveillance.",2018,Science & Technology - Other Topics

All biologic medicines are produced by living cells, resulting in an inherent heterogeneity in their higher order structures and post-translational modifications. In 2010, the US Congress enacted legislation to streamline the approval process for biosimilars of products losing patent protection, with the goal of decreasing costs and improving patient access to therapeutically important but expensive biologic agents. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first biosimilar agent through this pathway. Approval of additional biosimilar agents in the United States, including those used by nephrologists, is anticipated. Given the relative lack of knowledge regarding biosimilars and their approval process and a lack of trust by the nephrology community regarding their safety and efficacy, the National Kidney Foundation conducted a symposium, Introduction of Biosimilar Therapeutics Into Nephrology Practice in the U.S., September 17 to 18, 2015. Issues related to manufacturing, the regulatory approval process, interchangeability, substitution/switching, nomenclature, and clinician and patient awareness and acceptance were examined.

This information has proved significantly helpful in maintaining germplasm and to develop new superior genotypes by selecting suitable planting material. This study revealed the morphological (qualitative & quantitative) traits and genetic diversity for 30 grapes genotypes, which were collected from Potohar (salt range) region of Pakistan. The data information for ampelographic (qualitative & quantitative) traits were recorded for consecutive 3 years and data was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) method. Further, twelve SSR markers were used for grapes genotyping. Two SSR primers VVS4 and VVMD25 showed monomorphism in these genotypes while remaining ten S SR primers VVMD7, VVMD24, VMC4H6, VrZAG21, VVMD32, VrZAG25, VrZAG79, VMC4F3, VMC4A1 and VrZAG62 showed polymorphism in 30 grapes genotypes. The highest PIC value and maximum number of alleles were observed in primers VMC4A1, VVMD32 and VrZAG62. The result also identified a synonym genotype which showed 95.83% similarity between genotypes, BRI-001 and Sundar Khani The Euclidean distance metric and the Ward's agglomeration method were used in an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of all cultivars. This cluster analysis divided the genotyped into two main groups having further classes and subclasses between them, which revealed high potential for specific breeding goals.

Unfortunately, there is virtually no etiologic treatment for any of these lesions which are also accompanied by limited or extensive inflammation. This article reviews four groups of new antiulcer drugs discovered and patented in our lab in Boston and Long Beach/Irvine (Table 1). Actually, the first group, pyrazole and its derivatives can be used for prevention, i.e., long lasting protection of gastric mucosa against alcohol-or NSAID-induced erosions. Dopamine seems to be a new etiologic treatment for both upper and lower GI tract ulcers. Angiogenic growth factors like bFGF or PDGF (daily administration as peptides orally or by rectal enemas, or as single or double-dose of gene therapy) accelerated the healing of gastroduodenal ulcers and UC, while VEGF seems to be effective only for upper GI tract ulcers. Last but not least, a novel group of angiogenic steroids which not only stimulate new blood vessel formation and granulation tissue production (essential elements of healing of ulcer types) but may also exert mild or prominent anti-inflammatory action and seem to be ideal drugs for the treatment of IBD.",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Development of a Plasmodium berghei transgenic parasite expressing the full-length Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite VK247 protein for testing vaccine efficacy in a murine model,Circumsporozoite protein; Plasmodium berghei; Plasmodium vivax; PvCSP; Transgenic parasite; VK210; VK247; Vaccine; MALARIA VACCINE; TRANSMISSION; PROTECTION; CANDIDATE; REPEAT; SERA,"Background: The approach of using transgenic rodent malaria parasites to assess the immune system's response to antigenic targets from a human malaria parasite has been shown to be useful for preclinical evaluation of new vaccine formulations. The transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasite line [PvCSP(VK210)/Pb] generated previously expresses the full-length circumsporozoite protein (CSP) VK210 from Plasmodium vivax. The transgenic parasite expresses one of the two most common alleles of CSP, defined by nine amino acids at the central repeat region of this protein. In the present study, a transgenic P. berghei parasite line [PvCSP(VK247)/Pb] expressing the full-length PvCSP(VK247), which is the alternative common allele, was generated and characterized. Methods: The P. berghei expressing full-length PvCSP(VK247) was generated and examined its applicability to CSP-based vaccine research by examining its biological characteristics in mosquitoes and mice. Results: Similar to PvCSP(VK210)/Pb, PvCSP(VK247)/Pb developed normally in mosquitoes and produced infectious sporozoites equipped to generate patent infections in mice. Invasion of HepG2 cells by PvCSP(VK247)/Pb sporozoites was inhibited by an anti-PvCSP(VK247) repeat monoclonal antibody (mAb), but not by an anti-PvCSP(VK210) repeat mAb. Conclusions: These two transgenic parasites thus far can be used to evaluate the potential efficacy of PvCSP-based vaccine candidates encompassing the two major genetic variants in preclinical trials.",2016,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine

Overestimation of event rates reduces the required sample size but can compromise the statistical power of the RCT. Little is known about the prevalence, extent, and impact of overestimation of event rates. The latest RCTs on 10 preselected topics in the field of cardiovascular interventions and devices were selected, and actual primary event rates in the control group were compared with their respective event rate estimations. We also assessed what proportion of the nonsignificant RCTs was truly able to exclude a relevant treatment effect. A total of 27 RCTs randomizing 19,436 patients were included. The primary event rate in the control group was overestimated in 20 of the 27 RCTs (74.1%) resulting in a substantial relative difference between observed and estimated event rates (mean -22.9%, 95% confidence interval -33.5% to 12.2%; median -16.3%, 95% confidence interval -30.3% to -6.5%). Event rates were particularly overestimated in RCTs on biodegradable polymer drug-eluting coronary stents and renal artery stenting. Of the 14 single end point superiority trials with nonsignificant results, only 3 (21.4%) actually resulted in truly negative conclusions. In conclusion, event rates in RCTs evaluating cardiovascular interventions and devices are frequently overestimated. This under-reported phenomenon has fundamental impact on the design of RCTs and can have an adverse impact on the statistical power of these trials to answer important questions about therapeutic strategies.

Maturation of the Coordination Between Respiration and Deglutition with and Without Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Lesion in an Animal Model,Deglutition; Respiration; Recurrent laryngeal nerve; Sensorimotor; Infant; Development; Animal model; PATENT DUCTUS-ARTERIOSUS; REFLEX PHARYNGEAL SWALLOW; RHYTHMIC ORAL ACTIVITY; PRETERM INFANTS; CONCURRENT MANOMETRY; PROCAVIA-SYRIACUS; MINIATURE PIGS; IN-SITU; IMPACT; RAT,"y The timing of the occurrence of a swallow in a respiratory cycle is critical for safe swallowing, and changes with infant development. Infants with damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which receives sensory information from the larynx and supplies the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, experience a significant incidence of dysphagia. Using our validated infant pig model, we determined the interaction between this nerve damage and the coordination between respiration and swallowing during postnatal development. We recorded 23 infant pigs at two ages (neonatal and older, pre-weaning) feeding on milk with barium using simultaneous high-speed videofluoroscopy and measurements of thoracic movement. With a complete linear model, we tested for changes with maturation, and whether these changes are the same in control and lesioned individuals. We found (1) the timing of swallowing and respiration coordination changes with maturation; (2) no overall effect of RLN lesion on the timing of coordination, but (3) a greater magnitude of maturational change occurs with RLN injury. We also determined that animals with no surgical intervention did not differ from animals that had surgery for marker placement and a sham procedure for nerve lesion. The coordination between respiration and swallowing changes in normal, intact individuals to provide increased airway protection prior to weaning. Further, in animals with an RLN lesion, the maturation process has a larger effect. Finally, these results suggest a high level of brainstem sensorimotor interactions with respect to these two functions.",2018,Otorhinolaryngology

Drug Development Lessons Learned",drug development; CNS; translational research; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ANIMAL-MODELS; TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH; CNS DISORDERS; IN-VIVO; PROGRESS; DAMAGE,"The selective AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor antagonist, NS1209 (also known as SPD 502) has been explored in several research and development campaigns since its selection as a lead drug candidate in the early 1990s by the Danish biotechnology company, NeuroSearch. The compound was successively tested in animal models of stroke, neuropathic pain and epilepsy. The preclinical data to support development for the treatment of stroke were incomplete, as the compound was administered after the stroke episode, and did not protect subcortical areas of the brain. Preclinical data for neuropathic pain and epilepsy appeared more promising, but the design of the Phase IIa studies in both indications was suboptimal, and an exploratory study in neuropathic pain, like one in refractory epilepsy gave inconclusive results. Preclinical data in pain models were much less convincing than reported by the authors in abstract and discussion sections. Due to a long preclinical sequential testing phase and insufficiently powered clinical trials, NS 1209 disappeared from the CNS development pipeline, while its patent protection exclusivity was markedly reduced due to the unfortunate slow speed in development-a phenomenon far from unusual in CNS drug discovery. NeuroSearch ceased operations as an R&D entity in 2012 and its R & D portfolio was transferred to Teva Pharmaceuticals and to a spin off, Saniona A/S. Based on an in-depth case analysis of the development of NS 1209, a number of recommendations are given to reduce chances of failure during clinical development of neuropathic pain compounds and, more generally, of CNS compounds.

Design/methodology/approach The paper reports the results of qualitative tests for AZ31 magnesium alloy aircraft brackets with a triangular rib produced by a new forging method. These ribbed parts were formed on a forging press equipped with three moving tools. The produced aircraft brackets were subjected to qualitative tests. Their cross-sectional microstructure was examined using the light-field technique. The mechanical properties of ribbed parts were determined in a static tensile test and by hardness measurements on the surface of the part. The following variables were determined: tensile strength Rm, yield strength R0.2, elongation A5 and hardness. Findings The results of qualitative tests provide significant information about produced aircraft brackets with a triangular rib, i.e. microstructure in three key regions of brackets and their mechanical properties. Practical implications The method will enable producing magnesium alloy aircraft brackets with a triangular rib. The application of the method for aircraft brackets developed by the authors of this paper will result in higher product quality and reduced production costs. The paper demonstrates the practical application of this technique by presenting a finished aircraft bracket and the results of complete qualitative tests.

Gallbladder Radiation Protection in SIRT-Quantitative Anatomical Study of Hepatic Vasculature,SIRT; gallbladder radiation; vascular anatomy; hepatic artery; cystic artery; extrahepatic leaking; RESIN MICROSPHERES; RADIOEMBOLIZATION; EMBOLIZATION; THERAPY; COILING,"Introduction: This study was designed to assess quantitatively a safe position of the microcatheter during the SIRT (Selective Internal Radiation Therapy) procedure, in order to minimize the risk of non-target spheres leaking. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the distance of the tip of the microcatheter from coiled or patent non-target arteries was measured during Tc-99m-MAA work-up procedure. Frequency of extrahepatic leaking during work-up and SIRT procedures was evaluated. Results: There were 85 patients who underwent 98 work-up procedures. There were 64 radioembolizations. There were 44 gastroduodenal, 51 right gastric, and 54 cystic artery embolizations performed. Extrahepatic Tc-99m-MAA leaking was observed in 33 cases: 16 to gallbladder, four to a gastric wall, nine to the duodenum, one to the intestinal wall, and three to the abdominal wall. Leak in Tc-99m-MAA was also related to the presence of additional arteries (p = 0.009). There were 34 proximal and 31 distal to cystic artery Tc-99m-MAA injections resulting in 12 vs. four leaks, respectively (p = 0.039, RR-2.5). Mean distance of the tip of the microcatheter from the origin of the cystic artery was 20 mm (minimum of 2.1 mm and maximum of 53 mm) proximally and 10 mm (minimum 1 mm and maximum 51 mm) distally (ns). Conclusions: Leaking in Tc-99m-MAA (Tc-99m - labelled macroaggregated albumin) was related to the presence of additional arteries. Regardless of cystic artery embolization, it is 2.5 times safer to inject microspheres distal to its origin, compared to proximal injection. Cystic artery origin relative to the right hepatic artery division usually necessitates embolization of the former.",2019,General & Internal Medicine
THE COPY PROCESS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; FAIR-USE; INDEPENDENT INVENTION; PATENT; LAW; ECONOMICS; INNOVATION; DEFENSE; IP,"There's more than one way to copy. The process of copying can be laborious or easy, expensive or cheap, educative or unenriching. But the two intellectual property regimes that make copying an element of liability, copyright and trade secrecy, approach these distinctions differently. Copyright conflates them. Infringement doctrine considers all copying processes equally suspect, asking only whether the resulting product is substantially similar to the protected work. By contrast, trade secrecy asks not only whether but also how the defendant copied. It limits liability to those who appropriate information through means that the law deems improper. This Article argues that copyright doctrine should borrow a page from trade secrecy by factoring the defendant's copying process into the infringement analysis. To a wide range of actors within the copyright ecosystem, differences in process matter. Innovators face less risk from competitors if imitation is costly than if it is cheap. Consumers may value a work remade from scratch more than they do a digital reproduction. Beginners can learn more technical skills from deliberately tracing an expert's creative steps than from simply clicking cut and paste. The consequences of copying, in short, often depend on how the copies are made. Fortunately, getting courts to consider process in copyright cases may not be as far-fetched as the doctrine suggests. Black-letter law notwithstanding, courts sometimes subtly invoke the defendant's process when ostensibly assessing the propriety of the defendant's product. While these decisions are on the right track, it's time to bring process out into the open. Copyright doctrine could be both more descriptively transparent and more normatively attractive by expressly looking beyond the face of a copy and asking how it got there.",2016,Government & Law
The aquaphotomics approach as a tool for studying the influence of food coating materials on cheese and winter melon samples,aquaphotomics; food coatings; NIR spectroscopy; cheese ripening; winter melon storage; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; WATER SPECTRAL PATTERN,"Food packaging and coatings have the well-known and established functions of containment, protection and handling facilitation of the food packaged inside. Fast methods able to classify, sort and identify the quality and the stability characteristics associated with the various packaging and coating materials are required along the food chain in order to validate their properties. Innovative products deriving from organic polymers, recently submitted for Italian patent (no. 102015000018950), were used as coatings both in the food industry for two types of cheese (provola and caciotta) and in postharvest management to modulate fruit ripening of winter melons during storage at 13 degrees C. This work aimed at studying the effect of the differences in performance and permeability properties of the coatings after their application and during the ripening and storage period by using near infrared spectroscopy and exploiting the aquaphotomics approach, where information on the absorption bands can provide a distinct knowledge of water vibrations and intrinsic interactions between water and other components of the aqueous system. Applying multivariate spectral analysis, it was found that changes of water matrix under perturbation reflect other molecules surrounded by water, allowing the identification of specific fingerprints associated with coating characteristics and with the ripening/storage trends. Each coating generated a specific fingerprint for the same product suggesting that aquagrams could be a useful and fast procedure able to distinguish the effects of different coating materials on the same matrices. It was also proved that starting from similar aquagrams it was possible to follow and monitor the storage trends.",2016,Chemistry; Spectroscopy
Do national drug policies influence antiretroviral drug prices? Evidence from the Southern African Development community,Drug policy; developing countries; economic evaluation; effectiveness; essential drugs; evidence-based policy; health systems research; HIV; multivariate analysis; INCOME COUNTRIES; PROCUREMENT; MEDICINES,"Background: The efficacy of low-and middle-income countries' (LMIC) national drug policies in managing antiretroviral (ARV) pharmaceutical prices is not well understood. Though ARV drug prices have been declining in LMIC over the past decade, little research has been done on the role of their national drug policies. This study aims to (i) analyse global ARV prices from 2004 to 2013 and (ii) examine the relationship of national drug policies to ARV prices. Methods: Analysis of ARV drug prices utilized data from the Global Price Reporting Mechanism from the World Health Organization (WHO). Ten of the most common ARV drugs (first-line and second-line) were selected. National drug policies were also assessed for 12 countries in the South African Development Community (SADC), which self-reported their policies through WHO surveys. Results: The best predictor of ARV drug price was generic status-the generic versions of 8 out of 10 ARV drugs were priced lower than branded versions. However, other factors such as transaction volume, HIV prevalence, national drug policies and PEPFAR/CHAI involvement were either not associated with ARV drug price or were not consistent predictors of price across different ARV drugs. Conclusion: In the context of emerging international trade agreements, which aim to strengthen patent protections internationally and potentially delay the sale of generic drugs in LMIC, this study shines a spotlight on the importance of generic drugs in controlling ARV prices. Further research is needed to understand the impact of national drug policies on ARV prices.",2017,Health Care Sciences & Services
Planning operations before market launch for balancing time-to-market and risks in pharmaceutical supply chains,Market launch planning; New product introduction; Two-stage stochastic programming; Regulatory affairs; DIFFUSION; DRUGS; DEMAND,"Shorter product life cycles and the resulting increase in new product introductions boost the importance of product launch operations. In the pharmaceutical sector, product launch operations are of particular importance, as companies seek to reduce time-to-market to better exploit patent protection. Large volumes of product need to be ready to fill the downstream supply chain immediately at market launch. Building up the required inventory is, however, connected to several risks. In addition to the risk associated with the lack of demand information for a new product, there are several risks unique to the pharmaceutical sector. After approval by central authorities such as the FDA or EMA, a new drug still needs to receive market authorization, which is in most cases granted by some local authorities - in Europe, for example, by more than 30 national and regional bodies. The duration of these different market authorization processes as well as their outcomes (e.g. price and reimbursement levels, requirements of label or leaflet changes) are highly uncertain. We develop a two-stage stochastic model to support market launch preparation decisions. It trades off the costs of accepting these risks, for example by risk packaging before authorization, against the lost revenue caused by risk-averse operations. The model is applied to a case based on an empirical study. Our approach results in significant savings compared to current practices. We hereby provide an example of how quantitative methodology can provide valuable decision support for product launch operations, even when complex regulatory affairs need to be considered.

Perspectives of Hospital Pharmacists Towards Biosimilar Medicines: A Survey of Polish Pharmacy Practice in General Hospitals,; HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS; SPECIALISTS; PERCEPTION; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; AWARENESS,"IntroductionThere has been a significant increase in the volume of biosimilar medicines recently due to the expiries of patent protections of biologic medicines. Biosimilars are considered new medicines, and their usage in therapy is often associated with uncertainty from the perspectives of physicians, pharmacists and patients.ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to identify hospital pharmacist opinions towards these new medicines and investigate their usage in practice.MethodsA paper-based, self-administered questionnaire was distributed to Polish hospital pharmacists.ResultsBiosimilars were used in 77% of surveyed hospitals, whereas originator biologics were utilised within 90% of settings. The former medicines were found to consist of less than one-third of the entire course of biological pharmacotherapy used within Polish hospitals. A total of 88% of hospital pharmacists were concerned that the new drugs were not identical with the biologic versions, 48% with their immunogenicity and 44% with other pharmacokinetic properties. The majority of respondents (87%) stated that the most important advantage of biosimilars related to decreased costs. Furthermore, according to participants, pharmacist-led substitution is not appropriate.ConclusionDue to the numerous concerns relating to the usage of biosimilars, their introduction into patient therapy requires special attention from healthcare providers. While pharmacists involved in the distribution of biosimilars are conscious of their impact in decreasing costs of therapy, they do not feel comfortable in recommending their substitution without a physician's permission. There is a need for more precise legal regulations relating to biosimilars, improved communication between physicians and pharmacists, as well as educational initiatives to improve the safe and effective usage of biosimilars.",2019,Oncology; Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Determinants of Cash Holdings in Multinational Corporation's Foreign Subsidiaries: US Subsidiaries in China,Corporate Governance; Cash Holding; Multinational Corporations; Foreign Subsidiary Boards; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FIRMS HOLD; KNOWLEDGE FLOWS; AGENCY THEORY; GOVERNANCE; PERFORMANCE; OWNERSHIP; LIQUIDITY; POLICY; COSTS,"Manuscript TypeEmpirical Research Question/IssueWe examine determinants of cash holdings in Chinese subsidiaries of US multinational corporations (MNCs), a setting where growth opportunities make cash holdings desirable for investment opportunities but also vulnerable to potential expropriation because of poor investor protection. Research Findings/InsightsWe show that headquarters accumulate larger cash holdings in foreign subsidiaries with locally registered patents and in foreign subsidiaries operating in the same industry as corporate headquarters. Further, foreign cash holdings are higher when these are safeguarded by a subsidiary board. Moreover, the effect of shared industry on subsidiary cash holdings is larger when a board is installed in the subsidiary. Finally, the positive relation between a subsidiary's capability to innovate and to transfer knowledge and its level of cash holdings is stronger when the subsidiary is led by US expatriate CEOs. Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsOur results indicate that MNCs accumulate cash in foreign subsidiaries with innovation and knowledge transfer capabilities. Furthermore, and in line with agency theory, we find that MNCs safeguard foreign cash via the installing of subsidiary boards and expatriate CEOs. These findings suggest that the installing of monitoring devices are crucial in reducing the potential expropriation risk of foreign cash holdings. Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsOur study highlights the importance of considering foreign subsidiaries' positions in innovation and in knowledge transfer when MNCs make decisions on the levels of overseas cash holdings. It offers insights regarding the importance of subsidiary boards and expatriate CEOs in monitoring and controlling foreign subsidiaries.",2017,Business & Economics
Biosimilars-Emerging Role in Nephrology,Anemia; kidney disease; Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals; nephrology; Cost Savings; Drugs; Generic; EPO protein; human; erythropoietin; Research; ,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a biosimilar agent as a biologic that is highly similar to the reference or originator biologic product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of the safety, purity, and potency. The advantage of biosimilars is that they are usually about 15%-30% less expensive than the reference product, which results in system-wide cost savings and increased patient access. Because biologic drugs are produced by living organisms, they are by nature heterogeneous and identical copies cannot be made, unlike generic versions of small-molecule drugs. Proposed biosimilars must undergo a rigorous evaluation process to demonstrate a high degree of structural and functional similarity with the reference biologic. Once that is confirmed, a stepwise process of comparison with the reference agent with regard to animal trials, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and human efficacy/safety is conducted. The experience with biosimilars in other highly regulated markets where patent protection for originator biologics is not as robust as in the United States has been favorable in terms of safety, efficacy, and cost savings. An FDA approval pathway was created in 2009 to expedite the approval of biosimilars; as of early 2018 nine agents had been approved through that pathway, none in nephrology. The first United States biosimilar epoetin was approved on May 15, 2018, but does not have an interchangeability designation, meaning that prescribers must specifically write for the biosimilar product for patients to receive it. Given the unfamiliarity of biosimilars within the nephrology community it is recommended that educational programs be developed to address this unmet need and for research to be conducted addressing the perceptual, clinical, and economic effect of biosimilars on our patients.",2019,Urology & Nephrology

Unfortunately, vein graft disease (VGD) causes diminished patency rates. Innate immune system components are known to contribute to VGD. However, the role of T cells has yet to be established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of T cells and T cell activation pathways via the T cell receptor (TCR), co-stimulation and bystander effect in VGD. Methods and results: Here, we show upon vein graft surgery in mice depleted of CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells, that CD8+ T cells are locally activated and have a major protective role for vein graft patency. In presence of CD8+ T cells vein grafts appear patent while CD8+ T cell depletion results in occluded vein grafts with increases apoptosis. Importantly, the protective effect of CD8+ T cells in VGD development was TCR and co-stimulation independent. This was demonstrated in vein grafts of OT-I mice, CD70(-/-), CD80/86(-/-), and CD70/80/86(-/-) mice compared to C57BL/6 mice. Interestingly, cytokines including IL-15, IL-18, IL-33, and TNF are up-regulated in vein grafts. These cytokines are co-operatively capable to activate CD8+ T cells in a bystander-mediated fashion, in contrast to CD4+ T cells. Conclusions: T cells are modulators of VGD with a specific protective role of CD8+ T cells, which are locally activated in vein grafts. CD8+ T cells may protect against occlusive lesions by providing survival signals, and concert their protection independent of TCR and co-stimulation signaling.",2019,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Performance evaluation of novel wet vibrational precipitator,; ,"This study reports the development, construction, and initial testing of a novel vibrational precipitator (VP), patented at Ohio University in 2016, that uses vibrating metal cables with water running over them to capture particulate matter in an exhaust stream. Unlike traditional electrostatic precipitators relying on electric energy to capture particles, this new system uses the concept of vortex shedding to produce vibrations in vertical cables running perpendicular to an exhaust stream. Collisions between particles in the exhaust stream and these vibrating cables cause the particles to land onto a thin film of flowing water around the cables, which carries the particles downward for collection and removal. Initial tests with air containing particulates of 3 micron average particle size show capture efficiencies up to 54% using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 5 to measure the particulate concentrations at the upstream and downstream of a VP comprising 8 cells. These results show that this system, without consuming any electric energy, has a significant potential to be a simple and cost-effective way to treat particle-laden exhaust gases.Implications: In this work, for the first time, a novel precipitator is investigated that captures particles without using any particle charging and (hence) any electricity. The capture mechanism is governed by vibrations of collection electrodes, which are vertical steel cables wetted through continuous flow of water. Without any discharge electrodes, electrode suspension mechanism, and ability of the system to be installed in existing ducts, the novel precipitator becomes a simple chamber housing containing multiple collection electrode cells. The preliminary results show that this new technology can achieve net particulate matter capture efficiency of 54%. This paves a pathway forward for reducing capital and operating cost of air pollution control systems.",2019,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences

Medical Therapy for Asymptomatic Patients and Stent Placement for Symptomatic Patients Presenting with Carotid Artery Near-Occlusion with Full Collapse,; STRING SIGN; PSEUDO-OCCLUSION; SURGERY TRIAL; STENOSIS; ENDARTERECTOMY; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS; INTERVENTION; PROTECTION; DIAGNOSIS,"Purpose: To report long-term results of stent placement and medical therapy for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively, with carotid artery near-occlusion with full collapse. Materials and Methods: Between January 2008 and December 2010, 204 carotid arteries diagnosed by duplex scanning as exhibiting complete occlusion were re-examined with CT angiography; 46 arteries in 46 patients were patent with threadlike lumens and were reclassified as exhibiting near-occlusion with full collapse. Asymptomatic patients (n = 22) received best medical therapy (BMT) alone, and symptomatic patients (n = 24) were referred for carotid artery stent (CAS) placement plus BMT. Patients underwent clinical follow-up for 63.9 months +/- 23.6 and duplex surveillance. Results: None of the 22 asymptomatic patients treated with BMT alone experienced neurologic events during the follow-up interval. Four died of unrelated causes, resulting in a cumulative survival rate of 81.8%. Technical failure occurred in 5 of 24 symptomatic patients, but none had perioperative complications related to inability to cross the near-occlusion. Of the 19 patients with procedural success, 1 developed immediate upper limb monoparesis; none had periprocedural myocardial infarction, and none died. At 60-month follow-up, patients who underwent successful CAS placement had neurologic event-free and cumulative survival rates of 89.4% and 89.4%; patients with failed recanalization had neurologic event-free and cumulative survival rates of 0% and 40.0% (P = .01). Conclusions: Asymptomatic patients with carotid near-occlusion with full collapse experienced good outcomes with BMT alone. Symptomatic patients who underwent CAS placement demonstrated long-term survival and freedom from neurologic event rates comparable to those of asymptomatic patients.",2018,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology"

It is marketed under the brand name NeupogenA (R) by Amgen. Since this product has lost patent protection, many biosimilar versions have been approved or are in the process of filing for market authorization throughout the world. Here we show that NMR spectroscopy can be used to assess the three-dimensional structure of the active ingredient in the formulated approved product NeupogenA (R). Recombinant metHuG-CSF was prepared in E. coli and isotopically enriched with C-13 and (15) N isotopes. NMR spectroscopy was used to study the effects of excipients on the conformation. The effects of pH variation on the amide chemical shifts suggest the presence of cation-pi interactions between His-79 and Trp-118, and His-156-Trp-58-His-52 that stabilizes the conformation at low pH. This may be associated with a small local conformational change. The NMR data showed that polysorbate does not interact significantly with filgrastim thus allowing the collection of spectra in the presence of 20 times the formulation concentration in the sample. However, at higher detergent concentrations a reduction of signal intensity is observed. Conclusions The NMR fingerprint assay applied to filgrastim (NeupogenA (R) and a CRS from the European Pharmacopeia (EP)) provided residue specific information of the structure of the drug substance. In addition to current methods, the ability to assess the conformation with a high degree of resolution can greatly facilitate comparability exercises.",2015,Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy
In vivo dosimetry with MOSFETs and GAFCHROMIC films during electron IORT for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation,Electron IORT; In vivo dosimetry with MOSFETs and EBT2; GAFCHROMIC films; Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation; Quality Assurance; INTRAOPERATIVE RADIATION-THERAPY; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; EBT2 FILM; RADIOTHERAPY; CANCER; DETECTORS; VERIFICATION; CALIBRATION; ASTRO,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the delivered dose to the expected intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) dose with in vivo dosimetry. For IORT using electrons in accelerated partial breast irradiation, this is especially relevant since a high dose is delivered in a single fraction. Methods: For 47 of breast cancer patients, in vivo dosimetry was performed with MOSFETs and/or GAFCHROMIC EBT2 films. A total dose of 23.33 Gy at d(max) was given directly after completing the lumpectomy procedure with electron beams generated with an IORT dedicated mobile accelerator. A protection disk was used to shield the thoracic wall. Results: The results of in vivo MOSFET dosimetry for 27 patients and GAFROMIC film dosimetry for 20 patients were analysed. The entry dose for the breast tissue, measured with MOSFETs, (mean value 22.3 Gy, SD 3.4%) agreed within 1.7% with the expected dose (mean value 21.9 Gy). The dose in breast tissue, measured with GAFCHROMIC films (mean value 23.50 Gy) was on average within 0.7% (SD = 3.7%, range -5.5% to 5.6%) of the prescribed dose of 23.33 Gy. Conclusions: The dose measured with MOSFETs and GAFROMIC EBT2 films agreed well with the expected dose. For both methods, the dose to the thoracic wall, lungs and heart for left sided patents was lower than 2.5 Gy even when 12 MeV was applied. The positioning time of GAFCHROMIC films is negligible and based on our results we recommend its use as a standard tool for patient quality assurance during breast cancer IORT.",2017,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging"
Thermal power measurement of the novel evacuated tube solar collector and conventional solar collector during simultaneous operation,Thermal power measuring; Evacuated tube solar collector; Metal foam; Simultaneous operation; HEAT-PIPE; FLAT-PLATE; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; SYSTEMS; EXCHANGERS; NANOFLUIDS; PREDICTION; PLATFORM; COOKER; DESIGN,"The paper deals with a description of the measurement method and evaluation of the thermal power of evacuated tube solar collectors (ETSC) during their simultaneous operation at the Centre of Renewable Energy Sources, Technical University of Kosice, Slovakia. Evaluation was performed during various climatic and solar irradiance conditions on experimental measuring apparatus, that was designed and manufactured by authors. Key feature of measuring apparatus is its ability to ensure simultaneous operation of both evaluated collectors. This method of operation was selected in order to ensure identical conditions for both evaluated solar collectors during all performed measurements. Within the evaluation were investigated two types of ETSC - one with a conventional manifold header, and the other with a parallel flow manifold header with metal foam structural element that was proposed by authors and it is under patent protection. The main objective of the comparison was to evaluate the effect of used metal foam structure and changes in inner configuration on the overall thermal power of the proposed solar collector through outdoor quasi dynamic test. Part of measurement was also devoted to pressure drop analysis of proposed prototype of manifold header. Within the presented measurements, ETSC with parallel flow manifold header with metal foam structural element demonstrated significant thermal power increase ranging from 85.2 to 201.8W per 1 m(2) of collector area (depending on used flow rates of heat transfer medium) and increase of performance enhancement factor in range from 1.14 to 3.20.

Minimal Impact by Antenatal Subpatent Plasmodium falciparum Infections on Delivery Outcomes in Malawian Women: A Cohort Study,Malaria in pregnancy; low birth weight; rapid diagnostic test; malaria parasite detection; INTERMITTENT PREVENTIVE TREATMENT; MALARIA INFECTION; PREGNANT-WOMEN; ANEMIA; PROTECTION,"Antenatal malaria screening with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and treatment only of women with positive RDT findings may potentially prevent low birth weight resulting from malaria. The consequences of subpatent antenatal infections below the detection limit of RDTs are incompletely understood. In Malawi, pregnant women of any gravidity status were tested at each antenatal visit for Plasmodium falciparum, using an RDT and polymerase chain reaction analysis, and were followed until delivery. Associations between antenatal infections and delivery outcomes were assessed with Poisson regression or analysis of variance. Compared with women with no detected antenatal P. falciparum infection, women with positive RDT findings delivered babies with a lower mean birth weight (2960 vs 2867 g; mean difference, -93 g [95% confidence interval {CI}, -27 to -159]; P=.006); this was not observed among women with only subpatent infections (mean birth weight, 3013 g; mean difference, 54 [95% CI, -33-140]; P=.2268). These differences were apparent early in pregnancy, during the second trimester: compared with uninfected women, women with positive RDT findings delivered babies with a lower mean birth weight (mean difference, -94 g [95% CI, -31 to -156]; P=.003), but women with subpatent infections did not (mean difference, 36 g [95% CI, -49-122]; P=.409). Subpatent antenatal P. falciparum infections were not associated with adverse delivery outcomes. The association of patent infections at enrollment with low birth weight suggests the importance of preventing P. falciparum infection early in pregnancy.",2017,Immunology; Infectious Diseases; Microbiology
Mass spectrometric characterisation of darbepoetin alfa biosimilars with C-terminal arginine residues,mass spectrometry; erythropoietin; darbepoetin alfa; biosimilar; LC-MS/MS; RECOMBINANT HUMAN ERYTHROPOIETINS; HAMSTER OVARY CELLS; HUMAN URINARY; STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION; DOPING ANALYSIS; GLYCOPEPTIDE; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; GLYCOSYLATION; PRODUCTS,"Human erythropoietin (EPO) and recombinant human EPO (rEPO) are approximately 30-kDa glycosylated proteins comprising 165 amino acids. Darbepoetin alfa (NESP) is a glycosylated protein encompassing five changes in the amino acid sequence of human EPO, which contains two extra sugar chains. NESP is under patent protection in the USA until May 2024 and in Europe until July 2016, which suggests that the number of NESP biosimilars might substantially increase. The detailed characterisation of biosimilar products are required to ensure the identity and purity of the biosimilar products in terms of safety and efficacy for patients. In this study, a mass spectrometric characterisation of NESP biosimilar products is demonstrated. The study comprises a time-of-flight mass spectrometry characterisation for the asialo-NESPs after sialidase digestion and primary structure characterisation using bottom-up analysis after endoproteinase Glu-C digestion of the core protein. The study revealed that there was a wide range of glycoforms spaced by 365Da intervals, namely, HexHexNAc units, which indicated that NESP biosimilars likely contained more N-acetyllactosamine units in their molecules. The bottom-up analysis also showed that the NESP biosimilars, as well as a rEPO biosimilar, contain not only the des-arginine product but also the C-terminal arginine product comprising 166 amino acids, whereas the innovator products contain des-arginine EPO comprising only 165 amino acids. The C-terminal arginine EPO would be used as a potential marker for doping with EPO bisimilaras. These findings also point to a need for the investigation of immunogenicity and comparability for the biosimilar products.

THE BAYH-DOLE ACT & PUBLIC RIGHTS IN FEDERALLY FUNDED INVENTIONS: WILL THE AGENCIES EVER GO MARCHING IN?,; BOUNDED RATIONALITY,"For over thirty years, the Bayh-Dole Act has granted federal agencies the power to force the recipients of federal research funding to license the resulting inventions to third parties. Despite having this expansive power, no federal agency has ever seen fit to utilize it. This Note explores why Bayh-Dole march-in rights have never been used, and proposes reforms that would help ensure that, in the instances when they are most required, the public is able to access the inventions it bankrolled. There have been five documented march-in petitions since the Bayh-Dole Act was passed into law. Each petition was dismissed by the funding agency without progressing to the march-in proceeding stage. Even if one of these petitions had made it to the proceeding stage it is unlikely that a march-in would have occurred. The Bayh-Dole Act's march-in rights are designed in such a manner that makes their effective use highly unlikely. Procedurally, they offer expansive protections for patent holders and few safeguards for those who petition for march-in. A few minor reforms to the system could help appropriately balance the march-in system's design. Potential reforms include instituting an appeal process, mandating a duty to use best efforts to bring subject inventions to the point of practical application and report on those efforts, clarifying the meaning of Bayh-Dole's reasonable terms requirement, and instituting a requirement that subject inventions be marketed in the United States at internationally competitive rates. In addition, a requirement that subject inventions be licensed via public auction rather than private negotiation would help ensure that those best suited to commercializing inventions have the chance to secure the rights to them.",2015,Government & Law
"DON'T TAKE ME OUT TO THAT BALLPARK: STATE ACTION, GOVERNMENT SPEECH, AND CHIEF WAHOO AFTER MATAL",; ,"Close your eyes and imagine yourself driving to a concert. On the way, you pass a car bearing a license plate with the image of a Confederate flag. You pause, and ask ... Did the state approve that license plate? Does the state endorse the use of the Confederate flag? You keep driving. Eventually you reach the concert and walk in. To your surprise, an Asian-American band named The Slants is opening. You pause, and ask ... I thought the government approves trademarks? Does the Patent and Trademark Office endorse derogatory slurs? These questions strike at the heart of government speech-a doctrine which allows the government to speak as it pleases. Why is a license plate government speech, but a trademark not? On what basis can a court distinguish between the two? Given that government speech occurs outside of First Amendment protections, the answer has profound implications. And that answer may come from left field. The Cleveland Indians' controversial logo, Chief Wahoo, provides the perfect context for explaining why a license plate is government speech while a band's trademark is not. Before the publication of this Note, the Indians announced that, starting in 2019, they would remove Chief Wahoo from their jerseys. Even though the removal is a step forward in respecting indigenous communities, Chief Wahoo will continue to appear on team merchandise and will remain on the team's jerseys for the 2018 season. This Note examines how Chief Wahoo's appearance in the publicly-owned Progressive Field may constitute government speech. To do so, this Note introduces basic principles for reconceptualizing government speech after Matal-understanding government speech as a subset of state action and thus applying state action tests to discern the line between government speech and private speech.",2018,Government & Law
Transseptal Puncture to Facilitate Device Closure of Long-Tunnel Patent Foramen Ovale,catheterization; transseptal; closure; ASD; PDA; PFO; embolic protection devices; stroke; imaging; intracardiac echocardiography; TRANSCATHETER CLOSURE; DECOMPRESSION ILLNESS; NEUROLOGICAL EVENTS; CRYPTOGENIC STROKE; METAANALYSIS; SAFETY; PREVENTION; RECURRENCE; MIGRAINE,"BackgroundPatent foramen ovale (PFO) is common and may predispose to paradoxical embolism. Transcatheter device closure of PFO can be challenging in certain cases of long-tunnel PFO morphology. We report our experience with device closure of long-tunnel PFO using transseptal puncture. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed all cases of PFO device closure using transseptal puncture at the Mayo Clinic from January 1, 2010 to September 30, 2013. We arbitrarily defined a PFO tunnel configuration as a tunnel length12 mm as observed in intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) at the time of device closure. ResultsTwelve patients (mean age 40.8 [range 15-67] years; 7 males [58%]) underwent PFO device closure with transseptal puncture. The most common indication for PFO closure was previous stroke (n=7, 58%). Median tunnel length measured by ICE was 15 mm (12-20 mm). GORE (R) HELEX (R) Septal Occluder was used for closure in all but one patient. The only significant procedural complication was a minor perforation of the left atrial wall during attempted septal puncture, which resulted in a trivial pericardial effusion that resolved without intervention. At latest follow-up (mean 543 days, [range 170-1162]) one patient had a residual shunt and subsequently died due to complications during surgical PFO closure. No recurrent strokes or TIAs were reported. ConclusionThough not without risk, transseptal puncture can be a valuable tool for facilitating device closure of long-tunnel type PFOs. GORE (R) HELEX (R) Septal Occluder may be an effective option for facilitating device closure for patients with long-tunnel type PFO.

The use of acellular dermal matrix in immediate two-stage prosthetic breast reconstruction provides protection from postmastectomy radiation therapy: a clinicopathologic perspective,; TISSUE EXPANDER; RADIOTHERAPY; INFECTION; IMPLANT,"Although there is ample evidence showing that radiation therapy increases the risk of complications of breast reconstruction, the efficacy of human acellular dermal matrix (CGCryoDerm (R)) in immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction in the setting of postmastectomy radiation therapy has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we report our institutional experience with pertinent refined surgical technique, and determine whether acellular dermal matrices have a protective effect in this increasingly prevalent clinical setting. Twenty-six patients who underwent immediate two-stage breast reconstruction in the setting of postmastectomy radiation therapy with at least 2 years of follow-up were retrieved. Fifteen patents were reconstructed with ADM, whereas 11 patients were reconstructed without ADM. The occurrence of complications was assessed according to the reconstruction type (with ADM vs without ADM). Furthermore, in patients reconstructed with ADM (n = 15), immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the breast capsule with ADM compared with that without ADM in the same patient, according to the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). The occurrence of complications was significantly associated with the reconstruction type (with ADM vs. without ADM, p = 0.015). On the basis of the results of alpha-SMA staining, alpha-SMA+ myofibroblasts were relatively highly expressed throughout the breast capsule without ADM. On the contrary, alpha-SMA+ myofibroblasts present at the breast capsule adjacent to the ADM were scarce and irregularly scattered. Use of an acellular dermal matrix may be recommended to patients who are concerned about complications after immediate two-stage breast reconstruction in the setting of postmastectomy radiation therapy.",2018,Engineering; Materials Science
Characterization of the Antithrombotic Fingerprint of the Branded and Copies of the Low-Molecular-Weight Enoxaparin Using Thrombin Generation Assay,enoxaparin; thrombin generation; LMWH; biosimilars; anti-Xa activity; VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM; GENERIC VERSIONS; TISSUE FACTOR; HEPARINS; COAGULATION,"Background: The patent protection of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) expired, so the definition of criteria for the biological similarity between LMWH copies and the original product is a real need. Aim: The present in vitro study compared copies and branded enoxaparin using the specific anti-Xa activity and the calibrated automated thrombogram assay. Methods: Samples of platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from 15 healthy volunteers were spiked with branded enoxaparin (Lovenox) or its copies (Cutenox, Dilutol, Enoxa, Fibrinox, Loparin, Lupenox, Novex, Noxprin, and Versa). The specific anti-Xa activity was measured in PPP, and thrombin generation was assessed in PPP and PRP in the presence of tissue factor or pancreatic cancer cells BXPC3. Results: The anti-Xa activity of enoxaparin copies ranged from 0.072 to 0.088 IU/g, being lower as compared to the branded enoxaparin (0.095 anti-Xa IU/g). The potency of each copy to inhibit thrombin generation varied in the 3 experimental systems. The presence of platelets or pancreatic cancer cells BXPC3 in human plasma induced significant modifications in the inhibitory efficiency of enoxaparin copies on thrombin generation, which distinguished them from the branded product. Conclusion: Enoxaparin copies showed significant variability regarding their inhibitory potency on thrombin generation. Platelets and cancer cells significantly increased the variability of the antithrombotic efficiency of the copies as compared to the branded enoxaparin. The present study underlines the need for the elaboration of additional functional criteria to evaluate the global antithrombotic capacity of enoxaparin copies in order to evaluate their potential sameness with the branded drug.",2015,Hematology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Antibody and T-cell responses associated with experimental human malaria infection or vaccination show limited relationships,antibodies; infectious diseases; malaria; T cells; NATURALLY ACQUIRED-IMMUNITY; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; IFN-GAMMA; PROTECTION; INDUCTION; CYTOKINES; EXPOSURE; ANTIGEN; ADULTS,"This study examined specific antibody and T-cell responses associated with experimental malaria infection or malaria vaccination, in malaria-naive human volunteers within phase I/IIa vaccine trials, with a view to investigating inter-relationships between these types of response. Malaria infection was via five bites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes, with individuals reaching patent infection by 11-12days, having harboured four or five blood-stage cycles before drug clearance. Infection elicited a robust antibody response against merozoite surface protein-1(19), correlating with parasite load. Classical class switching was seen from an early IgM to an IgG1-dominant response of increasing affinity. Malaria-specific T-cell responses were detected in the form of interferon- and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELIspot, but their magnitude did not correlate with the magnitude of antibody or its avidity, or with parasite load. Different individuals who were immunized with a virosome vaccine comprising influenza antigens combined with P.falciparum antigens, demonstrated pre-existing interferon-, IL-2 and IL-5 ELIspot responses against the influenza antigens, and showed boosting of anti-influenza T-cell responses only for IL-5. The large IgG1-dominated anti-parasite responses showed limited correlation with T-cell responses for magnitude or avidity, both parameters being only negatively correlated for IL-5 secretion versus anti-apical membrane antigen-1 antibody titres. Overall, these findings suggest that cognate T-cell responses across a range of magnitudes contribute towards driving potentially effective antibody responses in infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity against malaria, and their existence during immunization is beneficial, but magnitudes are mostly not inter-related.",2015,Immunology
Neuroprotection From Organophosphate-Induced Damage by Novel Phenoxyalkyl Pyridinium Oximes in Rat Brain,oxime; organophosphate; acetylcholinesterase inhibition; reactivation; neuroprotection; glial fibrillary acidic protein; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; KAINIC ACID; SARIN; SEIZURE; PRALIDOXIME; RECEPTORS; NEURODEGENERATION; PROTECTION; EXPOSURE; BEHAVIOR,"The nerve agents are extremely toxic organophosphates which lead to massive inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The currently approved pyridinium oxime reactivators of organophosphate-inhibited AChE (eg, 2-PAM in the United States) cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier because of the permanent positive charge in the pyridinium ring. Therefore these current oximes cannot rescue inhibited AChE in the brain. Our laboratories have invented and patented a platform of substituted phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes that have been tested for efficacy as therapy within the brains of adult male rats which were challenged with a high sublethal dosage of highly relevant surrogates of sarin (nitrophenyl isopropyl methylphosphonate, NIMP) and VX (nitrophenyl ethyl methylphosphonate, NEMP). The histochemical astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was investigated as an indication of neuropathology in two brain regions, the piriform cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, which are regions known to be damaged by nerve agent toxicity. Rats treated with either NIMP or NEMP without therapy or with NIMP or NEMP plus 2-PAM therapy showed similar increases in GFAP compared with vehicle controls. However, the rats challenged with NIMP or NEMP plus therapy with our novel Oxime 20 (either a bromide or a mesylate salt) showed GFAP levels statistically undistinguishable from controls. These data provide highly supportive functional evidence of novel oxime entry into the brain. These novel oximes have the potential to provide central neuroprotection from organophosphate anticholinesterase-induced damage, which is a characteristic not displayed by most pyridinium oximes.",2018,Toxicology
Development and evaluation of corrosion resistant coating for expandable rock bolt against highly corrosive ground conditions,Rock bolt; Hard rock; Corrosive ground condition; Bolt corrosion; ,"Expandable rock bolts are widely used in hard rock mines as an efficient ground control product. However, capacity and service life can be significantly reduced if the metallic body is subjected to corrosion. In some hard rock mines in the U.S., highly corrosive ground conditions exist, and it has been reported that inflatable rock bolts have corroded within a few months after installation. To provide mining industry a cost-effective inflatable bolt and combat the corrosion issues, Jennmar Corporation, Inc., and its subsidiary Keystone Mining Services, LLC (KMS), analyzed corroded bolt samples, identified root causes, evaluated properties of various coating materials, and developed a new inflatable rock bolt, Python M3 (TM), that is protected with an innovative PyFlexU2 (TM) coating. The new generation Python M3 (TM) features improved steel chemistry for reliable performance, modified profile for better inflation, and surface preparation and coating application. The PyFlexU2 (TM) is impervious to liquid and air, durable, and UV resistant. With a flexible, adhesive, and highly corrosion-resistant undercoating, and a very hard sacrificial surface coating, the PyFlexU2 (TM) coating system provides the Python M3 (TM) superior protection against chemical corrosion and physical scratch damage. The under-coating has exceptional flexibility and adhesion to prevent coating micro-cracks or fractures after bolt inflation and possesses excellent corrosion resistance to acids (pH < 3), alkalis (pH > 11), fuels, and salt solvents. The corrosion and scratch resistant PyFlexU2 (TM) coating offers very effective bolt protection for extra longevity in highly corrosive environments. The Python M3 (TM) coated with PyFlexU2 (TM) has been tested in the most challenging conditions, including laboratory corrosion tests in extreme acidic and basic solvents, rock slurry, and borehole scratch insertion tests. With demonstrated corrosion and scratch resistance, the product has been greatly welcomed by hard rock mines in the West and is currently installed in large scale. This paper identifies the root causes of the bolt corrosion, discusses the analysis process, and details laboratory and underground tests carried out on the Python M3 (TM) coated with PyFlexU2 (TM). The Python M3 (TM) and PyFlexU2 (TM) are subjects covered by pending U.S. Patent Applications assigned to FCI Holdings Delaware, LLC.

Reflections on the ISPOR Special Task Force on US Value Frameworks: Implications of a Health Economics Approach for Managed Care Pharmacy,; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; DEFINING ELEMENTS; RECOMMENDATIONS,"In 2016, The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) formed a special task force (STF) to review approaches and methods to support the definition and use of high-quality U.S. value frameworks. As the leadership group of that initiative, we present our perspective, focusing on implications for the managed care pharmacy community. Our reflections are organized by 9 key observations and conclude with a summary recommendation. We begin by emphasizing the importance of distinguishing among perspectives and decision contexts. Possible perspectives include patient, payer, provider, health care sector, and societal. Decision contexts range from formulary inclusion to guideline development to clinical shared decision making, and multiple perspectives can be taken on each of these decisions. The STF focused on value in the context of including a new medicine in a formulary and, thus, health plan, using a health economics approach that compares marginal benefit (gross value) and marginal ( opportunity) cost, yielding the net value. Health care is unique compared with other markets. While economists often use market purchases as indicators of value, they also recognize that this does not work well in health care, since most patent-protected drugs are covered by insurance. To assess the likely health and economic impact, health economists often employ cost-effectiveness analysis, using the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), a metric that combines mortality and morbidity into a single preference-based index. We strongly endorse the STF's recommendation that payers should use the cost-per-QALY metric as a starting point. However, like the STF, and many of those stakeholders who provided input, we recognize that this metric has some limitations in theory and in practice. Nonetheless, the cost-per-QALY metric is a pragmatic tool that can be augmented to address some of its limitations by integrating other elements of value, particularly those related to uncertainty, such as financial risk protection, health risk protection, the value of hope, real option value, and the value of knowing. The resulting adjusted ratio can be compared with a willingness-to-pay threshold or combined in a measure of net monetary benefit. Alternatively, the array of elements can be valued using multi-criteria decision analysis. We end with the key recommendation that further development and testing of these promising approaches is needed to improve the deliberative process of health technology assessment.

Total flavonoid aglycones extract in Radix Scutellariae induces cross-regulation between autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells,Autophagy; Apoptosis; Pancreatic cancer; Akt; mTOR; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; SURVIVAL,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Radix Scutellariae (RS), the dried root of Scutellariae baicalensis Georgi, known as a herbal medicine in several Asian countries including China, has been widely used to treat inflammation, hypertension, cardiovascular disease as well as cancer. The total flavonoid aglycone extracted (TFAE) was extracted by ethyl acetate and this extraction methodology was optimized and obtained the protection of Chinese patents. Aim of the study: To investigate the underlying mechanism of the chemotherapeutic effects of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods: We performed CCK8 assays, AnnexinV-FITC/PI staining, flow cytometry assays, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot to study the molecular mechanism of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Results: In vitro, TFAE exhibits significant anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer cell lines, especially for BxPC3 (IC50 = 6.5 mu g mL(-1) ). Moreover, TFAE induces apoptosis and autophagy as evidenced by the increased apoptosis or autophagy-related protein level, the increased the fraction of apoptotic cells and the punctuate patterns of LC3 II. Furthermore, TFAE induce autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, pharmacological block autophagy by 3-MA enhanced TFAE-induced apoptosis, indicating that TFAE induced autophagy functions as a cytoprotective process against apoptosis. In vivo, 150 mg/kg TFAE inhibited the BxPC3 tumor growth in immune deficient mice with the inhibitory rate of 66.87% and induced both apoptosis and autophagy. Conclusion: TFAE have anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer and can induce apoptosis and autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway. TFAE might be a potential anticancer drug to be further developed for human pancreatic cancer therapy.",2019,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine
"Shengmai injection attenuates the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced autophagy via modulation of the AMPK, mTOR and JNK pathways",Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion; neuroprotection; signalling pathways; ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; KAPPA-B ACTIVATION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; BRAIN-INJURY; MOUSE MODEL; CELL-DEATH; MAI-SAN; ARTERY OCCLUSION; GINSENOSIDE RB1,"Context Shengmai injection (SMI) is a patented Chinese medicine originated from the ancient Chinese herbal compound Shengmai san, which is used extensively for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in the clinic. Objective To determine the neuroprotective effect of SMI, we investigated the effect of SMI on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice as well as the mechanisms underlying this effect. Materials and methods Right middle cerebral artery was occluded by inserting a thread through internal carotid artery for 1 h, and then reperfused for 24 h in mice. The neuroprotective effects were determined using transmission electron microscopic examination, the evaluation of infarct volume, neurological deficits and water brain content. Related mechanisms were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. SMI was injected intraperitoneally after 1 h of ischemia at doses of 1.42, 2.84 and 5.68 g/kg. The control group received saline as the SMI vehicle. Results Results showed that SMI (1.42, 2.84 and 5.68 g/kg) could significantly reduce the infarct volume, SMI (5.68 g/kg) could also significantly improve the neurological deficits, decreased brain water content, as well as the neuronal morphological changes. SMI (5.68 g/kg) could significantly inhibit the expression of autophagy-related proteins: Beclin1 and LC3. It also reduced the increase in LC3-positive cells. SMI (5.68 g/kg) remarkably inhibited the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), and down-regulated the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) after 24 h of reperfusion. Discussion and conclusion The results indicate that SMI provides remarkable protection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, which may be partly due to the inhibition of autophagy and related signalling pathways.",2016,Plant Sciences; Medical Laboratory Technology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Suhuang antitussive capsule inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorates pulmonary dysfunction via suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress in cough variant asthma,Suhuang antitussive capsule; Pulmonary dysfunction; Cough variant asthma; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; NLRP3; Inflammasome; CELL-DEATH; PKR; HOMEOSTASIS; NECROSIS; FUSION,"Pulmonary dysfunction is tightly associated with cough variant asthma (CVA), a respiratory damage disease. Suhuang antitussive capsule (Suhuang), one of traditional Chinese patent medicines, plays a crucial role in the treatment and complication of CVA in the long clinical application. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects and underlying antitussive mechanisms of Suhuang on pulmonary function in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced CVA rats. Administration (i.g.) of Suhuang significantly alleviated pulmonary damage and dysfunction. Suhuang improved ER stress and PKC epsilon translocation via regulation of Ca2+ trafficking. Suhuang also inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as evidenced by disrupting the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome and reducing the expression of cleaved caspase-1, and decreased IL-1 beta secretion. Besides, it's identified that TXNIP induction and RIP1-RIP3-Drp1 pathway were required for the inhibitory routes of Suhuang from ER stress to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Consistent with the in vivo findings, Suhuang also attenuated ER stress/NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and thereby restored pulmonary homeostasis in vitro. Meantime, these functions were diminished by blocking ER stress, indicating that ER stress is essential for the effects of Suhuang on pulmonary function. A further in vivo analysis showed that Suhuang-driven pharmacological inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome and amelioration of pulmonary dysfunction were reversed by an ER stress inducer tunicamycin, well confirming the beneficial effects of Suhuang on pulmonary function by regulation of ER stress. Collectively, these results indicated that Suhuang contributed to impairing NLRP3 inflammasome activation via inhibition of ER stress, which was responsible for the protection of pulmonary homeostasis. These findings may provide a pharmacological groundwork and important new experimental data regarding the clinical treatment of Suhuang in CVA patients.",2019,Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Over the past decade, new antihypertensive therapies have been developed, several have lost patent protection and additional evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of these agents has accrued. Objective To examine trends in the use of antihypertensive therapies in the United States between 1997 and 2012. Design, Setting and Participants We used nationally representative audit data from the IMS Health National Disease and Therapeutic Index to examine the ambulatory pharmacologic treatment of hypertension. Outcome Measures Our primary unit of analysis was a visit where hypertension was a reported diagnosis and treated with a pharmacotherapy (treatment visit). We restricted analyses to the use of six therapeutic classes of antihypertensive medications among individuals 18 years or older. Results Annual hypertension treatment visits increased from 56.9 million treatment visits (95% confidence intervals [CI], 53.9-59.8) in 1997 to 83.3 million visits (CI 79.2-87.3) in 2008, then declined steadily to 70.9 million visits (CI 66.7-75.0) by 2012. Angiotensin receptor blocker utilization increased substantially from 3% of treatment visits in 1997 to 18% by 2012, whereas calcium channel blocker use decreased from 27% to 18% of visits. Rates of diuretic and beta-blocker use remained stable and represented 24%-30% and 14-16% of visits, respectively. Use of direct renin inhibitor accounted for fewer than 2% of annual visits. The proportion of visits treated using fixed-dose combination therapies increased from 28% to 37% of visits. Conclusions Several important changes have occurred in the landscape of antihypertensive treatment in the United States during the past decade. Despite their novel mechanism of action, the adoption rate of direct renin inhibitors remains low.",2015,Science & Technology - Other Topics
Cost-effectiveness of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Treatment Strategies for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase After Generic Entry of Imatinib in the United States,; CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA; EARLY MOLECULAR RESPONSE; FOLLOW-UP; ECONOMIC-BENEFITS; PRICE-COMPETITION; THERAPY; DASATINIB; INTERFERON; NILOTINIB; OUTCOMES,"Background: We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of treating incident chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) with generic imatinib when it becomes available in United States in 2016. In the year following generic entry, imatinib's price is expected to drop 70% to 90%. We hypothesized that initiating treatment with generic imatinib in these patients and then switching to the other tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), dasatinib or nilotinib, because of intolerance or lack of effectiveness (imatinib-first) would be cost-effective compared with the current standard of care: physicians' choice of initiating treatment with any one of the three TKIs. Methods: We constructed Markov models to compare the five-year cost-effectiveness of imatinib-first vs physician's choice from a US commercial payer perspective, assuming 3% annual discounting ($US 2013). The models' clinical endpoint was five-year overall survival taken from a systematic review of clinical trial results. Per-person spending on incident CML-CP treatment overall care components was estimated using Truven's MarketScan claims data. The main outcome of the models was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We interpreted outcomes based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. A panel of European LeukemiaNet experts oversaw the study's conduct. Results: Both strategies met the threshold. Imatinib-first ($277 401, 3.87 QALYs) offered patients a 0.10 decrement in QALYs at a savings of $88 343 over five years to payers compared with physician's choice ($365 744, 3.97 QALYs). The imatinibfirst incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was approximately $883 730/QALY. The results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: When imatinib loses patent protection and its price declines, its use will be the cost-effective initial treatment strategy for CML-CP.",2016,Oncology
Big-pharmaceuticalisation: Clinical trials and Contract Research Organisations in India,India; Clinical trials; Contract Research Organisations; Pharmaceuticalisation; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; MEDICALIZATION; INTERSECTIONS; TRENDS; RIGHTS,"The World Trade Organisation's Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights [TRIPS] agreement aimed to harmonise intellectual property rights and patent protection globally. In India, the signing of this agreement resulted in a sharp increase in clinical trials since 2005. The Indian government, along with larger Indian pharmaceutical companies, believed that they could change existing commercial research cultures through the promotion of basic research as well as attracting international clinical trials, and thus create an international level, innovation-based drug industry. The effects of the growth of these outsourced and off-shored clinical trials on local commercial knowledge production in India are still unclear. What has been the impact of the increasing scale and commercialisation of clinical research on corporate science in India? In this paper we describe Big-pharmaceuticalisation in India, whereby the local pharmaceutical industry is moving from generic manufacturing to innovative research. Using conceptual frameworks of pharmaceuticalisation and innovation, this paper analyses data from research conducted in 2010-2012 and describes how Contract Research Organisations (CROs) enable outsourcing of randomised control trials to India. Focussing on twenty-five semi-structured interviews CRO staff, we chart the changes in Indian pharmaceutical industry, and implications for local research cultures. We use Big-pharmaceuticalisation to extend the notion of pharmaceuticalisation to describe the spread of pharmaceutical research globally and illustrate how TRIPS has encouraged a concentration of capital in India, with large companies gaining increasing market share and using their market power to rewrite regulations and introduce new regulatory practices in their own interest. Contract Research Organisations, with relevant, new, epistemic skills and capacities, are both manifestations of the changes in commercial research cultures, as well as the vehicles to achieve them. These changes have reinvigorated public concerns that stress not only access to new medicines but also the 'price' of innovation on research participants. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Intellectual Property Policy Strategies for Sustainable Manufacturing in India,IP strategy; Sustainable manufacturing; Business strategy; ,"Sustainability has become the buzzword in recent times. While manufacturing leads to considerable advantages like contributing to the GDP, providing goods and services for consumer, and generating employment opportunities, it is also contributing to the detriment of the environment and the natural resources, which run counter to the philosophy of sustainability. In order to achieve sustainability in manufacturing, substantial investments have to be made towards innovation, which can be protected under the intellectual property regime. But the IP rights prevent others from copying the technology, which is antithesis to the concept of sustainable manufacturing. Companies need to be aware of the IP policy of India, which facilitates the protection of environment and the natural resources. Also, India as a country needs to relook at the IP strategies available to ensure that it has sufficient access to technology, which can help in the proliferation of sustainable manufacturing technologies. This chapter provides for two levels of strategies, both relating to IP rights, which can be adopted by India, in order to achieve sustainable manufacturing in the country. The first level is the IP policy strategies that can be adopted by India, in light of the international treaties like TRIPS, the WTO system, as well as other treaties, conventions and protocols. The second level is the IP strategies that can be adopted by the non-governmental sector including the private commercial sector as well as the academic sector (both public funded as well as private funded). While the former analyses the TRIPS agreement and tries to understand how the objectives stipulated therein have been captured by the Indian IP legislations, the latter looked at strategies like investing towards R&D, licensing of technology, patent pools and copyright collectives, open source and open innovations, and also government initiatives that could ensure the implementation of sustainable manufacturing technology in India.",2018,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics
Development of a template for the classification of traditional medical knowledge in Korea,Conservation; Intellectual property rights; Traditional medical knowledge; Korea; Documentation; NORTH JEOLLA PROVINCE; MEDICINAL-PLANTS,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Traditional Medical Knowledge (TMK) is a form of Traditional Knowledge associated with medicine that is handed down orally or by written material. There are efforts to document TMK, and make database to conserve Traditional Medicine and facilitate future research to validate traditional use. Despite of these efforts, there is no widely accepted template in data file format that is specific for TMK and, at the same time, helpful for understanding and organizing TMK. Aim of the study: We aimed to develop a template to classify TMK. Materials and methods: First, we reviewed books, articles, and health-related classification systems, and used focus group discussion to establish the definition, scope, and constituents of TMK. Second, we developed an initial version of the template to classify TMK, and applied it to TMK data. Third, we revised the template, based on the results of the initial template and input from experts, and applied it to the data. Results: We developed the template for classification of TMK. The constituents of the template were summary, properties, tools/ingredients, indication/preparation/application, and international standard classification. We applied International Patent Classification, International Classification of Diseases (Korea version), and Classification of Korean Traditional Knowledge Resources to provide legal protection of TMK and facilitate academic research. The template provides standard terms for ingredients, preparation, administration route, and procedure method to assess safety and efficacy. Conclusions: This is the first template that is specialized for TMK for arranging and classifying TMK. The template would have important roles in preserving TMK, and protecting intellectual property. TMK data classified with the template could be used as the preliminary data to screen potential candidates for new pharmaceuticals. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We report the third update of the European Guidelines for the Management of RDS by a European panel of expert neonatologists including input from an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the beginning of 2016. Optimizing the outcome for babies with RDS includes consideration of when to use antenatal steroids, and good obstetric practice includes methods of predicting the risk of preterm delivery and also consideration of whether transfer to a perinatal centre is necessary and safe. Methods for optimal delivery room management have become more evidence based, and protocols for lung protection, including initiation of continuous positive airway pressure and titration of oxygen, should be implemented from soon after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of the management of RDS, and newer protocols for surfactant administration are aimed at avoiding exposure to mechanical ventilation, and there is more evidence of differences among various surfactants in clinical use. Newer methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been developed and offer potential for greater comfort and less chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease although minimizing the time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and if necessary postnatal steroids are also important considerations. Protocols for optimizing the general care of infants with RDS are also essential with good temperature control, careful fluid and nutritional management, maintenance of perfusion and judicious use of antibiotics all being important determinants of best outcome.

Economic evaluation of hormonal therapies for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer in Canada,Breast cancer; cost-effectiveness; tamoxifen; aromatase inhibitors; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT HEPARIN; SEQUENTIAL TAMOXIFEN-EXEMESTANE; INITIAL ADJUVANT THERAPY; AROMATASE INHIBITORS; COST-UTILITY; VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM; UPFRONT ANASTROZOLE; ENDOMETRIAL CANCER; VEIN-THROMBOSIS; LETROZOLE,"Background Aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy has been subjected to numerous cost-effectiveness analyses. However, with most ais having reached the end of patent protection and with maturation of the clinical trials data, a re-analysis of ai cost-effectiveness and a consideration of ai use as part of sequential therapy is desirable. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the 5-year upfront and sequential tamoxifen (TAM) and ai hormonal strategies currently used for treating patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive early breast cancer. Methods The cost-effectiveness analysis used a Markov model that took a Canadian health system perspective with a lifetime time horizon. The base case involved 65-year-old women with ER-positive early breast cancer. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to incorporate parameter uncertainties. An expected-value-of-perfect-information test was performed to identify future research directions. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYS) and costs. Results The sequential TAM-AI strategy was less costly than the other strategies, but less effective than upfront AI and more effective than upfront TAM. Upfront AI was more effective and less costly than upfront TAM because of less breast cancer recurrence and differences in adverse events. In an exploratory analysis that included a sequential AI-TAM strategy, AI-TAM dominated based on small numerical differences unlikely to be clinically significant; that strategy was thus not used in the base-case analysis. Conclusions In postmenopausal women with ER-positive early breast cancer, strategies using AIS appear to provide more benefit than strategies using TAM alone. Among the AI-containing strategies, sequential strategies using TAM and an AI appear to provide benefits similar to those provided by upfront AI, but at a lower cost.",2015,Oncology
KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF COMMUNITY PHARMACY EMPLOYEES TOWARDS AN AUTOMATIC DRUG SUBSTITUTION OF GENERICS AND BIOSIMILARS,generic substitution; biosimilars; pharmacist; follow-on biologics; automatic therapeutic substitution; ,"In recent years many patent protections of original biopharmaceuticals have expired and biosimilar medicines are being developed and are entering the pharmaceutical market. Polish legal framework does not narrow down automatic therapeutic substitution (ATS) of biopharmaceuticals at the pharmacy level. The aim was to assess the awareness of Polish community pharmacy employees and their attitude towards ATS of generics and biosimilar medicines. A self-designed online questionnaire consisting of 27 questions addressing ATS of generics and biopharmaceuticals was created. The survey respondents were approached personally at local pharmacies, via pharmacy managers, chain pharmacy owners and Chambers of Apothecaries. Data collected were entered into descriptive statistics tool provided by the survey hosting server. Simultaneously a printed survey dedicated to patients was created to asses patterns of behavior related to ATS. According to Polish community pharmacy employees the main reason for ATS was price competitiveness, unavailability of the reference drug and patientis wish. 7.3% of respondents have ever taken part in any drug safety monitoring program. 9.1% of pharmacy technicians and 46.8% masters of pharmacy claimed to have considerable knowledge about biosimilar drugs and evaluated biosimilars as carrying a higher risk of adverse events than generics. 17.2% would offer a substitution of a biopharmaceutical. 33.3% of patients did not tell their prescribing doctor about the ATS. The results of the study should be interpreted with caution since they might have been influenced by the selection of survey respondents. Nevertheless, the results suggest that there is a lack of knowledge and information, lack of national guidance on the conduct of ATS, and deficient communication between prescribers, pharmacies, and patients. Thus, there is a need for communication between the stakeholders to deliver information, guidance, and training for the ATS of all medicinal products, including biopharmaceuticals. Explicit legislation regulating ATS between reference biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars may be considered depending on the national policy.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Strategy for required data reduction in the practical implementation in a low-cost electronic platform of an index for damage assessment of seismic dampers,Data reducing; Optimization algorithms; Hysteretic dampers; Structural health monitoring; EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION; STRUCTURAL DAMAGE; OPTIMIZATION; FREQUENCY; WEB,"This paper presents a strategy to reduce the number of data required for the in-situ health evaluation of hysteretic energy dampers used for seismic protection of building structures. Such an optimization is essential in order to implement in practice the numerous indices now available for damage assessment of structures in real time, in the context of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). In general, damage indices are implemented and verified in lab systems entailing expensive and very specialized equipment, which permits the use and management of large amounts of data. For real-time field applications, low-cost embedded computers with limited calculation and data recording capacity may be used; however, they require thorough study of the influence of variables involved in the algorithms for calculation of the damage indices, with ulterior optimization and required data reduction. While the proposed strategy can be followed in broader applications and SHM techniques, the present paper focuses on its application to data coming from vibration tests carried out to evaluate damage of a particular type of hysteretic damper, the Web Plastifying Damper (WPD). The WPD was patented by the University of Granada for the passive control of structures subjected to earthquakes, through a non-parametric damage index previously developed by the authors. This study describes two steps for reducing data: (1) An in-depth study of the calculation time spent on each step of the theoretical algorithm; (2) A parametric study of the influence of key signal parameters-window length, number of windows and duration of the signal-on the damage index calculation in order to minimize the resources needed. Results show a successful optimization that permits the damage index to be calculated with the low-cost Picocom platform.",2018,Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation
PANDORA'S DIGITAL BOX: THE PROMISE AND PERILS OF DIGITAL WALLETS,; CARD MERCHANT RESTRAINTS; 2-SIDED MARKETS; COMPETITION; PRICELESS; COSTS,"Digital wallets, such as ApplePay and Google Pay, are smart payment devices that can integrate payments with two-way, realtime communications of any type of data. Integration of payments with realtime communications holds out tremendous promise for consumers and merchants alike: the combination, in a single, convenient platform, of search functions, advertising, payment, shipping, customer service, and loyalty programs. Such an integrated retail platform offers consumers a faster and easier way to transact, and offers brick-and-mortar retailers an eCommerce-type ability to identify, attract, and retain customers. At the same time, however, digital wallets present materially different risks for both consumers and merchants than traditional plastic card payments precisely because of their smart nature. For consumers, digital wallets can trigger an unfavorable shift in the applicable legal regime governing the transactions, increase fraud risk, create confusion regarding error resolution, expose consumers to non-FDIC-insured accounts, and substantially erode transactional privacy. These risks are often not salient to consumers, who thus cannot distinguish between different digital wallets on the basis of risk. Consumers' inability to protect against these risks points to a need for regulatory intervention by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to ensure minimum standards for digital wallets. For merchants, digital wallets can divest valuable customer information used for antifraud, advertising, loyalty, and customer service purposes. Digital wallets can also facilitate poaching of customers by competitors, impair merchants' customer relationship management, deprive merchants of influence over consumers' payment choice and routing, increase fraud risk, subject merchants to patent infringement liability, and ultimately increase the costs of accepting payments. Merchants are constrained in their ability to refuse or condition payments from digital wallets based on the risks presented because of merchant rules promulgated by credit card networks. These rules raise antitrust concerns because they foreclose entry to those digital wallets that offer merchants the most attractive valuation proposition: wallets that do not use the credit card networks for payments.",2018,Government & Law
The Impact of Integrated Community Case Management of Childhood Diseases Interventions to Prevent Malaria Fever in Children Less than Five Years Old in Bauchi State of Nigeria,; INSECTICIDE-TREATED NETS; BED NETS; COUNTRIES,"Background Malaria accounts for about 300,000 childhood deaths and 30% of under-five year old mortality in Nigeria annually. We assessed the impact of intervention strategies that integrated Patent Medicines Vendors into community case management of childhood-diseases, improved access to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) and distributed bed nets to households. We explored the influence of household socioeconomic characteristics on the impact of the interventions on fever in the under-five year olds in Bauchi State Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional case-controlled, interventional study, which sampled 3077 and 2737 under-5 year olds from 1,588 and 1601 households in pre- and post-intervention periods respectively, was conducted from 2013 to 2015. Difference-in-differences and logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the impact attributable to the interventions: integrated community case management of childhood illness which introduced trained public and private sector health providers and the possession of nets on the prevalence of fever. Results Two-week prevalence of fever among under-fives declined from 56.6% at pre-intervention to 42.5% at post-intervention. Fever-prevention fraction attributable to nets was statistically significant (OR = 0.217, 95% CI: 0.08-0.33). Children in the intervention group had significantly fewer incidence of fever than children in the control group had (OR = 0.765, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87). Although being in the intervention group significantly provided 23.5% protection against fever (95% CI: 0.13-0.33), the post-intervention likelihood of fever was also significantly less than at pre-intervention (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.50-0.65). The intervention protection fraction against fever was statistically significant at 43.4%(OR = 0.434, 95% CI: 0.36-0.50). Logistic regression showed that the odds of fever were lower in households with nets (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.88), among children whose mothers had higher education, in the post-intervention period (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.33-0.46) and in the intervention group (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.48-0.66). The odds of fever increased with higher socio-economic status of households (17.9%-19.5%). Difference-in-differences showed that the interventions significantly reduced occurrence of fever in the intervention group (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.36-2.14). Conclusion The interventions were effective in reducing the prevalence and the likelihood of childhood malaria fever. Taken to scale, these can significantly reduce the burden of malaria fever in the under-five year old children.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics
Evaluation of collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy during and after segmental artery occlusion in a chronic large animal model,collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy; minimally invasive segmental artery coil and plug embolization; spinal cord protection; thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair; AORTIC-ANEURYSM REPAIR; SPINAL-CORD ISCHEMIA; COIL EMBOLIZATION; REIMPLANTATION; PARAPLEGIA; INJURY; FLOW,"Objective: Ischemic spinal cord injury remains the most devastating complication after open and endovascular aortic repair. Collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy has been introduced to noninvasively monitor real-time spinal cord oxygenation. In view of recent advancements in endovascular treatment and minimally invasive staged preconditioning before aortic repair, this study sought to evaluate collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy during and after segmental artery occlusion in a chronic porcine model. Methods: Surgery for segmental artery occlusion was performed in 12 juvenile pigs, and bilateral lumbar collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy was recorded. Two intervention groups were designed: Group 1 received subtotal segmental artery occlusion (mimicking reimplantation of crucial segmental arteries with patent T12/T13, N = 5), and group 2 received total occlusion (T4-L5, N = 7). Pigs were monitored over 3 days. Results: All animals were paraplegic during the first 24 hours. The subtotal occlusion group completely recovered, whereas 57% of the total occlusion group remained paraplegic (N = 4/7). After segmental artery occlusion, collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy decreased from 92.3 % +/- 8 % of baseline to 69.3% +/- 18% after 10 minutes in the subtotal group (P = .003-.017) and from 90.1% +/- 4% to 58.2% +/- 9% in the total group (P < .001-.008). Throughout the postoperative period, collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy in the total occlusion group remained lower compared with the subtotal group (<30% base-line threshold, P < .05). Lumbar collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy and neurologic outcome were significantly correlated (R = 0.7, P < .001). Conclusions: Lumbar collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy reacts to occlusion of segmental arteries and correlates with neurologic outcome. The preliminary data suggest that collateral network near-infrared spectroscopy may be a valuable noninvasive tool for detecting imminent spinal cord ischemia during and after aortic procedures involving segmental artery occlusion.",2019,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery
Patients Decision Aid System Based on FHIR Profiles,Decision support; Laboratory information system; Telemedicine; First order predicates; ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; LABORATORY TESTS; CLINICAL-TRIAL; IMPLEMENTATION; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE,"Patients are becoming more and more involved in clinical decision-making process. Several factors support this process. Advances in omics allows individualization of diagnosis and treatment. Patient awareness and easy availability of data on the Internet allows patients to become informed decision makers when it comes even to disease management. Mass media emphasize the issue of medical errors, making patients demanding for quality in medical care. In some healthcare settings, patents face a problem of interpreting medical data and making decisions on treatment tactics without having a doctor, who could potentially support them. Delegating this task to a Patient Decision Aide system can add automatically generated recommendations to result reports without adding significant workload on the doctors, increase patients' motivation and support their decisions. We have implemented a patient decision aid system based on the productions rules, which: Collects data from available sources; Automatically analyses and interprets laboratory test results; Recommends running additional tests for a more precise diagnostic; Delivers automatically generated reports to doctors and patients in a natural language. To achieve semantic interoperability with other systems we have implemented a FHIR engine. The knowledge base has been organized as a graph structure. The application is structured as a set of lightly coupled services, which implement the logic of the decision support system. In total, we have modelled 365 nodes of test components, 5084 nodes of inference rules, 49932 connections and 3072 blocks of text for medical certificates. The findings of the research provide a deep understanding of how the semantically interoperable clinical decision support systems are implemented. Advances in notification the patients with the elements of patient decision aid is important for clinical data management, and for patients' empowerment and protection. We suppose that the system empowering patients in such way can play a meaningful role in helping patients to make informed decisions during the process of diagnostics and treatment.",2018,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics

Due to insufficient knowledge about its etiopathogenesis, curative treatments are not available. One of the most promising new research concepts is the mild encephalitis hypothesis of schizophrenia, developed mainly by Karl Bechter and Norbert Willer. According to this hypothesis, a significant subgroup of schizophrenia patients suffer from a mild, but chronic, form of encephalitis with markedly different etiologies ranging from viral infections, traumas to autoimmune diseases. This inflammatory process is thought to occur in the beginning or during the course of the disease. In this article, we investigate the consequences of the mild encephalitis hypothesis of schizophrenia for the scientific community, and evaluate these consequences ethically. The mild encephalitis hypothesis implies that schizophrenia would no longer be considered an incurable psychiatric disorder. Instead, it would be considered a chronic, but treatable, neurological disease. This paradigm shift would doubtlessly have significant consequences: (1) major reforms would be necessary in the theoretical conceptualization of schizophrenia, which would challenge the psychiatric diagnostic systems, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 and ICD-10. (2) Psychotic patients should be treated in interdisciplinary teams, optimally in neuropsychiatric units; additionally, specialists for endocrinology, diabetology, and cardiology should be consulted for the frequently occuring somatic comorbidities. (3) Current diagnostic procedures and (4) therapies would have to be modified significantly. (5) There might be repercussions for the pharmaceutical industry as well: first, because old drugs with expired patent protection could partly replace expensive drugs and, second, because there would be a demand for the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs. (6) Legal evaluation of compulsory treatment orders might have to be reconsidered in light of causal therapies; leading to increased legal approval and reduced need for compulsory treatment orders due to better patient compliance. (7) The social inclusion of patients might improve, if treatment became more effective regarding cognitive and social functioning. (8) The stigmatization of patients and their relatives might decrease.",2017,Psychiatry

For effectively controlling tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), vectors of African trypanosomosis, causing nagana, repellents more powerful than plant derived, from a non-host animal the waterbuck, Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa, have recently been identified. Here we investigate these repellents in the field to protect cattle from nagana by making cattle as unattractive as the buck. Methodology/Principal findings To dispense the waterbuck repellents comprising guaiacol, geranylacetone, pentanoic acid and delta-octalactone, (patent application) we developed an innovative collar-mounted release system for individual cattle. We tested protecting cattle, under natural tsetse challenge, from tsetse transmitted nagana in a large field trial comprising 1,100 cattle with repellent collars in Kenya for 24 months. The collars provided substantial protection to livestock from trypanosome infection by reducing disease levels >80%. Protected cattle were healthier, showed significantly reduced disease levels, higher packed cell volume and significantly increased weight. Collars >60% reduced trypanocide use, 72.7% increase in ownership of oxen per household and enhanced traction power (protected animals ploughed 66% more land than unprotected). Land under cultivation increased by 73.4%. Increase in traction power of protected animals reduced by 69.1% acres tilled by hand per household per ploughing season. Improved food security and household income from very high acceptance of collars (99%) motivated the farmers to form a registered community based organization promoting collars for integrated tsetse control and their commercialization. Conclusion/Significance Clear demonstration that repellents from un-preferred hosts prevent contact between host and vector, thereby preventing disease transmission: a new paradigm for vector control. Evidence that deploying water buck repellents converts cattle into non-hosts for tsetse flies-'cows in waterbuck clothing'.",2017,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine

This contrasts with the remaining burden of cardiovascular disease in Europe and in the world. Thus, clinical cardiovascular research needs to adapt to address the impact of these challenges in order to ensure development of new cardiovascular medicines. Methods and results The present paper is the outcome of a two-day workshop held by the Cardiovascular Round Table of the European Society of Cardiology. We propose strategies to improve development of effective new cardiovascular therapies. These can include (i) the use of biomarkers to describe patients who will benefit from new therapies more precisely, achieving better human target validation; (ii) targeted, mechanism-based approaches to drug development for defined populations; (iii) the use of information technology to simplify data collection and follow-up in clinical trials; (iv) streamlining adverse event collection and reducing monitoring; (v) extended patent protection or limited rapid approval of new agents to motivate investment in early phase development; and (vi) collecting data needed for health technology assessment continuously throughout the drug development process (before and after approval) to minimize delays in patient access. Collaboration across industry, academia, regulators, and payers will be necessary to enact change and to unlock the existing potential for cardiovascular clinical drug development. Conclusions A coordinated effort involving academia, regulators, industry, and payors will help to foster better and more effective conduct of clinical cardiovascular trials, supporting earlier availability of innovative therapies and better management of cardiovascular diseases.",2016,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
The Potential Impact of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) on public health,trade and health; health policy; European Union; United States; LIBERALIZATION; POLICY; TIME,"This article aims to examine the potential health effects of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment partnership (TTIP). Our review indicates that, although proponents of the TTIP claim that the treaty will produce benefits to health-enhancing determinants such as economic growth and employment, evidence shows that previous trade liberalization policies are associated with increasing economic inequities. By reducing Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and by promoting increased cooperation between US and EU governmental agencies in the pharmaceutical sector, the TTIP could result in improved research cooperation and reduced duplication of processes. However, the TTIP chapter on Intellectual Property (IP) and Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) that expand and extend patent monopolies, and delay the availability of generic drugs, are likely to cause underutilization of needed medications among vulnerable populations. The TTIP's Investor to State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) arbitration system, a mechanism that allows transnational companies (TNCs) to sue governments when a policy or law reduces the value of their investment, is likely to generate a negative impact on regulations aimed at increasing access to healthcare, and reducing tobacco, alcohol consumption, and diet-related diseases. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS) of the TTIP is expected to weaken regulations in the food and agricultural sectors especially in the EU, with potentially negative effects on food safety and foodborne diseases. Finally, the ISDS is likely to infringe the ability of governments to tackle environmental problems such as climate change deemed to be the most important global health threat of the century. Our review concludes by discussing policy implications and the effect of the TTIP on democracy, national sovereignty and the balance of power between large TNCs and governments. It also discusses the adoption of an evidence-based precautionary principle approach in dealing with the health impact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) as well as the harmonization of regulations, norms, and standards toward stronger health and environmental protection.",2016,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
Experimental and numerical investigations of flow through catalytic converters,Fluid flow; Catalytic converter; Thermal; CFD; Experimental; MONOLITH CATALYSTS; HEAT-TRANSFER; MASS; SIMULATION,"The need for improved fuel economy, while meeting more stringent global vehicle emission standards, continues to grow with the increasing demand for environmental protection and rising fuel prices. A new generation of catalytic converters, designed and patented by Vida Fresh Air Corp., offers emissions reduction while improving fuel economy. In this design, a thin layer of insulating material is placed inside the ceramic honeycomb channels, creating a multi-chamber catalytic converter. The improvement in performance of the catalytic converter is attributed to the change in both the flow distribution and the controlled heat diffusion from the inner to the outer chambers. On engine performance tests have shown significant improvements in both fuel economy and emissions, however, the theory of operation of this design needs to be validated for potential design improvements to achieve an optimum performance. In this study both experimental and numerical investigations are carried out in order to understand the flow through the catalytic converter, using different monolith cell densities. A dynamically scaled-down model for a typical flow through catalytic converter was utilized for this study. Detailed experiments were conducted using hot air as the working fluid in order to evaluate the thermal and fluid flow characteristics of the new catalytic converter technology without the effect of chemical reactions. The measurements were performed at a Reynolds number of 43,000 with a free stream temperature of 177 degrees C. These conditions were selected in order to achieve thermal and hydraulic similarity to actual flow conditions for a typical catalytic converter. Numerical modelling of the flow through the setup under investigation was found to adequately replicate the experimental measurements for temperature, velocity and turbulence intensity within +/- 3%, +/- 5% and +/- 8% respectively.

The health impact of trade and investment agreements: a quantitative systematic review and network co-citation analysis,Trade and investment agreements (RTAs); Trade policy; Foreign investment policy; Diets; Tobacco; Non-communicable diseases; Health outcomes; Systematic review; Co-citation analysis; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; NUTRITION TRANSITION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; GLOBALIZATION; LIBERALIZATION; PREVENTION; DISEASE; OBESITY; GROWTH; DIET,"Background: Regional trade agreements are major international policy instruments that shape macro-economic and political systems. There is widespread debate as to whether and how these agreements pose risks to public health. Here we perform a comprehensive systematic review of quantitative studies of the health impact of trade and investment agreements. We identified studies from searches in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Global Health Online. Research articles were eligible for inclusion if they were quantitative studies of the health impacts of trade and investment agreements or policy. We systematically reviewed study findings, evaluated quality using the Quality Assessment Tool from the Effective Public Health Practice Project, and performed network citation analysis to study disciplinary siloes. Results: Seventeen quantitative studies met our inclusion criteria. There was consistent evidence that implementing trade agreements was associated with increased consumption of processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Granting import licenses for patented drugs was associated with increased access to pharmaceuticals. Implementing trade agreements and associated policies was also correlated with higher cardiovascular disease incidence and higher Body Mass Index (BMI), whilst correlations with tobacco consumption, under-five mortality, maternal mortality, and life expectancy were inconclusive. Overall, the quality of studies is weak or moderately weak, and co-citation analysis revealed a relative isolation of public health from economics. Conclusion: We identified limitations in existing studies which preclude definitive conclusions of the health impacts of regional trade and investment agreements. Few address unobserved confounding, and many possible consequences and mechanisms linking trade and investment agreements to health remain poorly understood. Results from our co-citation analysis suggest scope for greater interdisciplinary collaboration. Notwithstanding these limitations, our results find evidence that trade agreements pose some significant health risks. Health protections in trade and investment treaties may mitigate these impacts.",2017,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
Negative stiffness honeycombs for recoverable shock isolation,Design; Selective laser sintering; Mechanical properties of materials; Honeycomb materials; Negative stiffness; ,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of negative stiffness beams when arranged in a honeycomb configuration and to compare the energy absorption capacity of these negative stiffness honeycombs with regular honeycombs of equivalent relative densities. Design/methodology/approach - A negative stiffness honeycomb is fabricated in nylon 11 using selective laser sintering. Its force-displacement behavior is simulated with finite element analysis and experimentally evaluated under quasi-static displacement loading. Similarly, a hexagonal honeycomb of equivalent relative density is also fabricated and tested. The energy absorbed for both specimens is computed from the resulting force-displacement curves. The beam geometry of the negative stiffness honeycomb is optimized for maximum energy absorption per unit mass of material. Findings - Negative stiffness honeycombs exhibit relatively large positive stiffness, followed by a region of plateau stress as the cell walls buckle, similar to regular hexagonal honeycombs, but unlike regular honeycombs, they demonstrate full recovery after compression. Representative specimens are found to absorb about 65 per cent of the energy incident on them. Optimizing the negative stiffness beam geometry can result in energy-absorbing capacities comparable to regular honeycombs of similar relative densities. Research limitations/implications - The honeycombs were subject to quasi-static displacement loading. To study shock isolation under impact loads, force-controlled loading is desirable. However, the energy absorption performance of the negative stiffness honeycombs is expected to improve under force-controlled conditions. Additional experimentation is needed to investigate the rate sensitivity of the force-displacement behavior of the negative stiffness honeycombs, and specimens with various geometries should be investigated. Originality/value - The findings of this study indicate that recoverable energy absorption is possible using negative stiffness honeycombs without sacrificing the high energy-absorbing capacity of regular honeycombs. The honeycombs can find usefulness in a number of unique applications requiring recoverable shock isolation, such as bumpers, helmets and other personal protection devices. A patent application has been filed for the negative stiffness honeycomb design.",2015,Engineering; Materials Science

From this reason there is valid within the framework of the European Union the standard Euro, which is specifically defined in the transport area. Nowadays the actual issue of this standard is signed Euro 6. It is established in order to eliminate most of the undesirable air pollutants. However, there is already prepared a new and even stricter emission standard Euro 7. It is a well-known fact that the actual emission standards are very hard and the automobile factories, together with the engine design concepts are trying to fulfil the new emission standards, mainly the NOX emission requirements. These circumstances also caused the infamous affair dieselgate. The new engine concept, which is called HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition), could be a suitable solution of the present NOX emission problems. Principle of the HCCI technology is based on self-ignition of the homogenous fuel mixture using compression in order to reduce emissions, whereas the NOX emission level is almost negligible. However, there are also several essential problems connected with the above-mentioned innovative technology, for example a high level of pressures arising during the compression process and intensive heat release. Another serious problem is a complicated control of the self-ignition process. This article presents an original technical solution, which enables to regulate the whole self-ignition process and in this way to ensure a reliable operation of the HCCI engine. We would like to emphasize also a fact that this unique solution was applied for a patent, as well. The innovated piston combustion engine was installed in the experimental vehicle designed for participation at the international competition shell eco marathon 2018 in London focused on minimisation of the fuel consumption.

Updated Cost-effectiveness Assessments of PCSK9 Inhibitors From the Perspectives of the Health System and Private Payers Insights Derived From the FOURIER Trial,; SURVIVAL; DISEASE; DEATH,"IMPORTANCE Preliminary cost-effectiveness analyses of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) were based on benefits estimated from reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that occurred in PCSK9i trials with variable results. The recent Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial provides better information about the effectiveness of the drug. OBJECTIVE To use the trial results to determine the cost-effectiveness of a PCSK9i and statin treatment strategy compared with a statin alone strategy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We derived observed rates of events, outcomes, cost of care, and health insurance from existing literature for a theoretical cohort of patients designed to resemble the FOURIER PCSK9i trial population and created a Markov model during the time horizon of a full lifetime. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from a health system perspective, and the return on investment from a private payer perspective. For both measures, we assumed an annual PCSK9i drug price of $14 300, with a lapse in US patent protection that would reduce the price by 43% in year 12. Costs were reported in 2016 US dollars. RESULTS This study modeled 1000 hypothetical patients with attributes similar to those of the FOURIER trial cohort. At the current price, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of statin plus PCSK9i therapy was $337 729 per quality-adjusted life-year. Our probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that a statin plus PCSK9i strategy had a low probability (<1%) of being cost effective at the commonly accepted societal threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Furthermore, PCSK9i produced a negative return on investment of 86% for private payers. In our threshold analysis, the price of PCSK9i would need to drop 62%, to $5459 per year, to reach $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE At current prices, the addition of PCSK9i to statin therapy is estimated to provide an additional quality-adjusted life year for $337 729. Significant discounts are necessary to meet conventional cost-effectiveness standards.",2017,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
"Long-term effectiveness and safety of transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale compared with antithrombotic therapy alone: a meta-analysis of six randomised clinical trials and 3,560 patients with reconstructed time-to-event data",PFO closure; prior stroke; prior transient ischaemic attack; stroke; ,"Aims: Although three recent trials have shown a significant stroke risk reduction after tPFOc, the individual statistical power is limited and the impact on pooled evidence needs to be explored. We aimed to pool data from available randomised clinical trials (RCT) to assess whether tPFOc is more effective and safe than antithrombotic therapy alone (ATA). Methods and results: Major electronic databases and tangential sources were searched. Six trials (3,560 patients) were identified. At a median follow-up of 3.6 (2.0-5.2) years (13,930 person-years), the risk of stroke was significantly lower after tPFOc compared with ATA (HR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.12-0.64, p=0.003). Significant heterogeneity was detected (I-2=66.1%), although single trials did not significantly influence the results. Reconstructed time-to-event data revealed that tPFOc benefits accrue after approximately one year and persist over time without significant variations (96.4% versus 88.0%; HR 0.25, 95% CI: 0.09-0.66, p=0.005; NNT=11). Although results showed a greater benefit in patients <45 years old, male, and with substantial shunt, interaction between subgroups was not significant. Trial sequential analysis showed that accumulated evidence appeared to be sufficient. However, tPFOc did not confer protection against transient ischaemic attack (TIA; HR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.31-1.54, p=0.365) and a significant excess in the risk of atrial fibrillation was observed (OR 4.99, 95% CI: 1.99-10.10, p<0.001), though generally early and transient. Major bleeding and migraine were comparable between treatments. Conclusions: Compared with ATA, tPFOc significantly reduces the risk of stroke at long-term follow-up but no benefit is observed in terms of TIA. Atrial fibrillation is higher after tPFOc, though generally early and transient. The risks of major bleeding and migraine are comparable between the groups.",2018,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
Clinical Outcomes of Plavix and Generic Clopidogrel for Patients Hospitalized With an Acute Coronary Syndrome,"acute coronary syndrome; clopidogrel; hospitalization; ischemic attack, transient; propensity score; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ASPIRIN; BIOEQUIVALENCE; THERAPY; TRENDS","BACKGROUND: Clopidogrel is one of the most commonly prescribed medications because of its ability to improve clinical outcomes for a broad range of cardiovascular conditions. After patent protection expired for Plavix in 2012, many healthcare systems adopted generic clopidogrel as a strategy to reduce healthcare costs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a population-based observational study to determine whether generic clopidogrel was noninferior to Plavix. Patients who were hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) from 2009 to 2014 in Ontario, Canada, >65 years, survived >= 7 days after discharge, were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was a composite of death and recurrent ACS at 1 year. The noninferiority margin was prespecified at a relative hazard difference of 10%. Inverse propensity of treatment weighting of the propensity score was used to account for differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment groups. The effect of clopidogrel on the hazard of clinical outcomes was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model within the propensity-weighted cohort using Plavix as a reference. Our study included 24 530 patients with ACS, 12 643 were prescribed Plavix and 11 887 were prescribed generic clopidogrel at hospital discharge. The mean age was 77 years, 57% were men, and 21% had an ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. At 1 year, 17.6% of patients prescribed Plavix and 17.9% of patients prescribed clopidogrel experienced the primary outcome (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.08; P=0.005 for noninferiority). No significant differences between rates of death, all-cause readmission, ACS, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or bleeding were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Generic clopidogrel was noninferior to Plavix with respect to the composite end point of death and recurrent hospitalization for ACS at 1 year among adults >65 years after an ACS hospitalization. Our findings support generic clopidogrel in ACS, which could lead to substantial healthcare cost savings.",2018,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology

We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARMS-I (TM) (currently marketed as Halo (TM)) in the prevention of URIs. Methods: ARMS-I is patented novel formulation for the prevention and treatment of influenza, comprising a broadspectrum antimicrobial agent (cetylpyridinium chloride, CPC) and components (glycerin and xanthan gum) that form a barrier on the host mucosa, thus preventing viral contact and invasion. Healthy adults (18-45 years of age) were randomized into ARMS-I or placebo group (50 subjects each). The drug was sprayed intra-orally (3x daily) for 75 days. The primary objectives were to establish whether ARMS-I decreased the frequency, severity or duration of URIs. Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety, tolerability, rate of virus detection, acceptability and adherence; effect on URI-associated absenteeism and medical visits; and effect of prior influenza vaccination on study outcomes. Results: Of the 94 individuals who completed the study (placebo: n = 44, ARMS-I: n = 50), six presented with confirmed URI (placebo: 4, ARMS-I: 2), representing a 55% relative reduction, albeit this was statistically not significant). Influenza, coronavirus or rhinovirus were detected in three participants; all in the placebo group. Moreover, frequency of posttreatment exit visits was reduced by 55% in ARMS-I compared to the placebo group (N = 4 and 2, respectively). Fever was reported only in the placebo group. ARMS-I significantly reduced the frequency and severity of cough and sore throat, and duration of cough (P <= .019 for all comparisons). ARMS-I was safe, well tolerated, had high acceptability and high adherence to medication use. Medical visits occurred only in the placebo group while absenteeism did not differ between the two arms. Prior influenza vaccination had no effect on study outcome. Conclusions: This randomized proof-of-concept clinical trial demonstrated that ARMS-I tended to provide protection against URIs in the enrolled study participants, while reducing severity and duration of cough and sore throat. A clinical trial with a larger number of study participants is warranted.",2017,Infectious Diseases
Does selection for growth rate in broilers affect their resistance and tolerance to Eimeria maxima?,Coccidiosis; Eimeria maxima; Broiler; Genetic selection; Resistance; Tolerance; Growth rate; Bone mineralisation; NITRIC-OXIDE PRODUCTION; FED REPRESENTATIVE 1957; DIETARY VITAMIN-E; ACERVULINA INFECTION; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; TENELLA INFECTIONS; DISEASE RESISTANCE; COMMERCIAL BROILER; ANTIBODY-RESPONSE; CROSS-PROTECTION,"Chickens exhibit varied responses to infection with Eimeria parasites. We hypothesise that broilers selected for increased growth rate will show lower resistance and tolerance to a coccidian challenge. 288 chickens of fast (F) or slow (S) growing lines were inoculated with 0 (control), 2500 (low-dose), or 7000 (high-dose) sporulated E. maxima oocysts at 13 days of age in two consecutive rounds. Gain and Intake were measured daily and their values relative to BW at the point of infection were calculated over the pre-patent (days 1-4 post-infection), acute (d5-8 pi), and recovery (d9-12 pi) phases of infection to assess the impact of infection. Levels of plasma carotenoids, vitamins E and A, long bone mineralisation, caecal microbiota diversity indices, and histological measurements were assessed at the acute (d6 pi) and recovery stage (d13 pi). In addition, we measured the levels of nitric oxide metabolites and the number of parasite genome copies in the jejunumat d6pi. In absolute terms F birds grew 1.42 times faster than S birds when not infected. Infection significantly reduced relative daily gain and intake (P < 0.001), with the effects being most pronounced during the acute phase (P < 0.001). Levels of all metabolites were significantly decreased, apart from NO which increased (P < 0.001) in response to infection on d6pi, and were accompanied by changes in histomorphometric features and the presence of E. maxima genome copies in infected birds, which persisted to dl3pi. Furthermore, infection reduced tibia and femur mineralisation, which also persisted to dl3pi. Reductions in measured variables were mostly independent of dose size, as was the level of parasite replication. The impact of infection was similar for S and F-line birds for all measured parameters, and there were no significant interactions between line x dose size on any of these parameters. In conclusion, our results suggest that line differences in productive performance do not influence host responses to coccidiosis when offered nutrient adequate diets.",2018,Parasitology; Veterinary Sciences
Promoting healthcare innovation on the demand side,FDA; insurers; health innovation; intellectual property; pharmaceuticals; precision medicine; OFF-LABEL USE; SURROGATE END-POINTS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; DRUG SAFETY; RECORDS; POLICY; RISK; DISCOVERY,"Innovation policy often focuses on fortifying the incentives of firms that develop and sell new products by offering them lucrative rights to exclude competitors from the market. Regulators also rely on these same firms-and on similar incentives-to develop information about the effects of their products in patients, despite their obvious conflict of interest. The result may be a distorted understanding that leads to overuse of expensive new medical technologies. Recent technological advances have put healthcare payers in an excellent position to play a larger role in future innovation to improve healthcare and reduce its costs. Insurance companies and integrated healthcare providers have custody of treasure troves of data about healthcare provision and outcomes that can yield valuable insights about the effects of medical treatment without the need to conduct costly clinical trials. Some integrated healthcare systems have seized upon this advantage to make notable discoveries about the effects of particular products that have changed the standard of care. Moreover, to the extent that healthcare payers can profit from reducing costs, they will seek to avoid inappropriate use of costly technologies. Greater involvement of payers in healthcare innovation thus offers a potential counterweight to the incentives of product sellers to promote excessive use of costly new products. In recent years, the federal government has sought to promote innovation through analysis of healthcare records in a series of initiatives; some picture insurers as passive data repositories, while others provide opportunities for insurers to take a more active role in innovation. In this paper, we examine the role of health insurers in developing new knowledge about the provision and effects of healthcare-what we call 'demand-side innovation'. We address the contours of this underexplored area of innovation and describe the behavior of participating firms. We examine the effects of current legal rules on demand-side innovation, including insurance regulation, intellectual property rules, privacy protections, and FDA regulation of new healthcare technologies. Throughout, we highlight many policy tools that government can use and is using to facilitate payer innovation outside the traditional toolkit of patents and exclusive rights.",2017,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine
Innominate artery cannulation for proximal aortic surgery: outcomes and neurological events in 263 patients,Innominate artery cannulation; Aortic surgery; Axillary artery cannulation; HYPOTHERMIC CIRCULATORY ARREST; AXILLARY ARTERY; BRAIN PROTECTION; ARCH SURGERY; ASCENDING AORTA; SIDE GRAFT; SAFE; EXPERIENCE; SITE,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether innominate artery cannulation is the ideal perfusion strategy for delivering antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) during surgery on the proximal ascending aorta and transverse aortic arch. METHODS: A total of 263 patients underwent innominate artery cannulation with a side graft for surgery on the proximal aorta. Operations performed were ascending and proximal arch replacement (n = 213, 81.0%), ascending and total arch replacement (n = 33, 12.6%) and ascending aortic replacement (n = 12, 4.6%). Concomitant or other procedures included aortic root replacement and repair (n = 113, 43.0%), aortic valve replacement or repair (n = 118, 44.9%), coronary artery bypass (n = 40, 15.2%), antegrade stent graft delivery to the proximal descending thoracic aorta for aneurysm or dissection (n = 28, 10.7%), mitral valve repair (n = 11, 4.2%), patent foramen ovale repair (n = 3, 1.1%) and tricuspid valve repair (n = 2, 0.8%). Twenty-seven patients (10.3%) presented with acute or subacute Type I aortic dissection, and 45 (17.1%) had a previous sternotomy. Median cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cardiac ischaemia and ACP times were 126.0 [95-163 interquartile range (IQR)], 91.0 (73-121 IQR) and 21.0 (16-32 IQR) min. Bilateral ACP was delivered in 235 patients (90.7%). RESULTS: The operative mortality rate was 4.9% (n = 13). Nine patients (3.4%) had postoperative stroke, which was permanent in 5 (1.9%) of them. Multivariate analysis associated risk of stroke or temporary neurological deficit with acute or subacute Type I aortic dissection (P = 0.028) and age (P = 0.015). Renal disease (P = 0.036) and CPB time (P = 0.011) were independent risk factors for operative mortality. Circulatory arrest time was identified as a risk factor for mortality (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Innominate artery cannulation can be performed safely and poses a low risk of neurological events in procedures requiring hypothermic circulatory arrest. The technique for cannulating this artery should be part of the routine armamentarium of cardiac and aortic surgeons, and the innominate artery is among the preferred perfusion sites for delivering ACP.",2015,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery
A new method for producing magnesium alloy twin-rib aircraft brackets,Forging; Numerical simulations; Aircraft components; Three-slide forging press; Magnesium alloys; Twin-rib brackets; ,"Purpose - The purpose of the present paper is to develop a new technology for producing magnesium alloy twin-rib aircraft brackets by the forging method. Design/methodology/approach - An overall description of magnesium alloys is given, with particular emphasis placed on magnesium wrought alloys that are used in the aircraft industry. Methods for producing ribbed brackets are discussed and the location of these parts in aircraft structure is described. The forging process for producing AZ31 magnesium alloy twin-rib brackets was modelled numerically, and selected results of the simulations performed are presented. The simulation results were then verified under laboratory conditions using a three-slide forging press equipped with three movable working tools. It was assumed that the use of this machine would allow for obtaining twin-rib aircraft brackets with improved both functional and strength properties compared to the production methods used so far. Findings - The results demonstrate that the method developed by the present authors permits the production of twin-rib brackets. Positive theoretical results and preliminary experimental results prove that it is justified that the research on magnesium alloys used in the aircraft industry be continued. Practical implications - The production of twin-rib aircraft brackets from magnesium alloys by the technology developed by the present authors would lead to enhanced product quality with simultaneous reduction in production costs (reduced labour costs and material consumption as well as increased process efficiency). At present, magnesium alloy aircraft parts, mainly obtained from semi-finished products imported to Poland, are produced by casting and machining methods. They exhibit, however, much worse properties than elements produced by metal forming methods. In addition to that, the application of machining in the production of these part leads to higher production costs. Originality/value - The originality of this study stems from the presentation of an innovative metal forming technology for producing twin-rib brackets. This method is unique on a global scale, and its basic assumptions have been granted patent protection. Also, the originality of the study stems from the fact that brackets are made from magnesium alloys, as these light metals are considered the future of structural materials used in the aircraft industry. Given the above, the research on developing the technology for producing parts made from these alloys using a three-slide press is justified.",2015,Engineering
Confidentiality agreements: a challenge in market regulation,Equity; Confidentiality agreements; Market regulation; MANAGED ENTRY; EXPERIENCES; PAYERS,"BackgroundSustainability and the ability to maintain the right to health, with the guarantee of access to quality medicines and health services, have been a great challenge for countrieswith universal health systems. The great technological advances bring with it an expressive increase in the expenditures of the health systems, especially those directed towards the acquisition of high-cost drugs, which are still under patent protection, have a high cost and, in some cases, present uncertainties about their effectiveness and safety. As a way of maintaining the proper functioning of the systems and guaranteeing access to these medicines, some countries started to negotiate discounts with manufacturing companies. Pricing agreements have been adopted by developed countries with the objective of reducing their spending on high-cost medicines and, although they represent an opportunity for better negotiation with the industries, they violate the principle of transparency that regulates the world market. However, the existence of confidentiality agreements has meant that the declared prices are not the actual prices, unfairly harming the countries that use these price lists as beacons in their systems.MethodsRepresentatives of health, judicial, legislative, patient organizations and academics from eight countries in Latin America and South Korea participated in a meeting in September 2017 in Chile to discuss price confidentiality agreements and the impact on public health policies. During the meeting, participants were presented with a hypothetical case to subsidize the discussion on the topic. Divided into groups, participants should propose recommendations for the problem by pointing out the pros and cons if each proposed recommendation was adopted. The groups were then confronted by a simulated jury and finally issued a single and final recommendation for the problem.ResultsThe topic was widely discussed and recommendations were raised by theparticipants. Among them, it is worth noting the elaboration of norms that regulate the negotiations of prices between the countries bringing transparency and harmony in the adopted conducts. In addition, the possible consequences and potential impacts of confidentiality on drug prices and inputs, such as information asymmetry and inequity of access between countries, were pointed out.ConclusionDespite there are efforts to make price negotiations more transparent, there is still no well-established standardization that promotes a well-functioning market. Confidentiality agreements hamper the fairness of access to essential health products.",2019,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"
Transcranial Doppler findings in antiphospholipid syndrome,Transcranial Doppler; antiphospholipid syndrome; cerebral blood flow; microembolic signals; right-to-left shunt; systemic lupus erythematosus; PATENT FORAMEN OVALE; TO-LEFT SHUNT; SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; MICROEMBOLIC SIGNALS; CEREBRAL MICROEMBOLI; ULTRASOUND; CLOSURE; STROKE; ANTICOAGULATION; MANIFESTATIONS,"Introduction Transcranial Doppler is a method that enables the assessment of different cerebral hemodynamic parameters. It also allows for the evaluation of the presence of right-to-left circulation shunts (RLS) and for the detection of microembolic signals (MESs), which might be associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events. For instance, the presence of MESs on transcranial Doppler in patients with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Therefore, transcranial Doppler could be a useful tool for stroke risk stratification in these patients. Objective Our objective was to evaluate transcranial Doppler cerebral mean blood flow velocities as well as the presence of MESs and RLS in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and SLE. Patients and methods Twenty-two patients with primary APS (PAPS), 24 patients with secondary APS (SAPS), 27 patients with SLE without APS and 21 healthy controls were evaluated. Clinical and epidemiological data were compiled from medical charts, and all subjects underwent transcranial Doppler examination with breath-holding index calculation. Both middle cerebral arteries were monitored for 60 min for the detection of MESs. RLS was investigated with agitated saline injected as a bolus. Results There were no significant differences in mean blood flow velocities among the groups. MESs were more frequently found in patients with SLE when compared with controls and patients with APS (SLE: 17.4%, SAPS: 4.3%, PAPS: 0%, controls: 0%, p = 0.03). Anticoagulant therapy was more frequently used in the APS group (PAPS: 81.8%, SAPS: 75.2%, SLE: 1.7%, p < 0.001). Patients with APS had a higher frequency of RLS when compared with volunteers (63.6% versus 38.1%, p = 0.05). Breath-holding index values tended to be lower in patients with SAPS than in control subjects and patients with PAPS and SLE (p = 0.06). Conclusions Patients with APS had a higher frequency of RLS than healthy controls. This finding alerts to the importance of cardiac investigation in patients with stroke and APS, because further therapies such as RLS occlusion might eventually add protection. The higher frequency of MES in patients with SLE could suggest an effect of anticoagulant therapy on MES prevention, more frequently used in patients with APS.",2019,Rheumatology
Technology transitions within telecommunications networks: Lessons from US vs. Canadian policy experimentation under federalism,Broadband; Common carrier; Deregulation; Federalism; Internet protocol; Monopoly; Path dependence; Policy experimentation; Public relations; Public utility; EVOLUTION,"This article examines why recent telecommunications policy outcomes are diverging between the U.S. and Canada, notwithstanding the similarities in their common law and statutory law histories. The consequences of this divergence are profound. As technology transitions within the public switched telecommunications network proceed, the U.S. imposes fewer obligations on broadband and Internet service providers and provides a much-diminished level of consumer protection relative to that in Canada. The role of differing administrative procedures and policymaking forums is an important factor contributing to recent policy divergence. Historical analysis also reveals the importance of the role of path dependence from some early differences in U.S. and Canadian policy choices made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These differences in early policy choices emerged from (1) differences in federalism structures between the U.S. and Canada; (2) negation of Bell patents in Canada that triggered an earlier era of telephony competition as well as both federal and provincial policy experimentation; and (3) AT&T's unique public relations campaign of regulated monopoly developed in the U.S. in response to this earlier policy experimentation in Canada. AT&T's public relations campaign has induced a false memory in the U.S. - not found in Canada - as to the origins of regulated monopoly for telephony. This false memory has contributed to the efficacy of telecommunications carriers' false monopoly theory argument - that their historical duties have been based on the existence of monopoly, and thus are not applicable in a competitive environment - which has and continues to distort telecommunications policy development in the U.S. including the network neutrality debate. Yet, telecommunications carriers' dual status as common carriers and public utilities under the common law has created confusion in both the U.S. and Canada. This confusion has created a tendency to misattribute the duty to serve to the existence of monopoly, providing a different although still historically flawed basis for asserting a monopoly theory argument for the purpose of eliminating regulation. This confusion, however is more easily corrected in Canada where there was no comparable public relations campaign of regulated monopoly for proponents of deregulation to leverage. The resonance of early policy differences between the U.S. and Canada illustrates the complexity of pursuing telecommunications policy debates within multi-jurisdictional legal frameworks a challenge that the European Union currently faces in developing a Telecommunications Single Market.

Effect of octreotide acetate combined with somatostatin on treating acute pancreatitis and expression of miRNA-200 family,Octreotide acetate; somatostatin; acute pancreatitis; miR-200 family; MICRORNA-200 FAMILY; PREVENTION; INJURY; ROLES,"Objective: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe disease of acute onset, rapid progression, multiple complications and high mortality. In this study, patients with pancreatitis were respectively treated with octreotide acetate, somatostatin or the combination of both. The clinical efficacy and genesis of complications in the 3 groups were compared and analyzed. Expression of miR-200 family in serum of the patients was detected to provide theoretical basis for the treatment of pancreatitis. Data and methods: The case information of 153 patients with acute pancreatitis treated in our hospital during Jan. 2010 to Dec. 2014 was retrospectively analyzed. There were 52 cases in octreotide acetate treatment group, 48 cases in somatostatin treatment group and 53 cases in octreotide acetate combined with somatostatin treatment group. The patents were assessed according to the following indexes: the main symptoms and remission of signs; blood and urine amylase, and WBC changes before treatment and 3, 6, 9, and 12 days after treatment; recovery of laboratory parameters including WBC of AP, AST, blood glucose, and blood calcium, as well as complication rate and case fatality rate; days of symptoms and signs disappearing, days of blood amylase, urine amylase and blood WBC recovery; hepatic function recovery etc. Results: the efficacy of octreotide acetate combined with somatostatin on acute pancreatitis was good. Remission of symptoms and signs, as well as recovery of blood amylase, urine amylase and blood WBC recovery, was fast. In early or mid period of AP treatment, the combination of octreotide acetate and somatostatin could reduce complication rate or death rate. Recovery effect of WBC, AST, blood glucose and blood calcium was significant. As for patients with AP complicated with hepatic injury, the combination treatment had good effect of liver protection. The adverse reactions of octreotide acetate combined with somatostatin were few. And the efficacy of combination treatment was better than using octreotide acetate or somatostatin alone. Expression of miR-200 family members including miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141 and miR-429 was up-regulated, showing a positive correlation with combination treatment. Conclusion: Octreotide acetate combined with somatostatin was a new effective approach of treating AP, and could effectively improve symptoms, with protective effect on multi-organ damage. Moreover, detection of miR-200 family expression in blood could dynamically monitor the effect of combination treatment on AP clinically, with more objectivity and rationality.",2017,Oncology; Pathology

The authors present a series of pediatric MMD patients who underwent a standard revascularization procedure, pial synangiosis, more than 20 years previously at a single institution by a single surgical team. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of all patients aged 21 years or younger treated for MMD at Boston Children's Hospital who were operated on more than 20 years previously by the senior author (R.M.S.). Radiographic and operative reports, outpatient clinical records, and communications with patients and families were reviewed to document current clinical status, ability to perform daily activities, and concurrent or new medical conditions. RESULTS A total of 59 patients (38 female [64.4%], 21 male [35.6%]; median age at surgery 6.2 years [IQR 0.5-21 years]) were identified who were diagnosed with MMD and underwent surgical revascularization procedures more than 20 years previously. Clinically, all but 2 patients (96.6%) presented with the following symptoms alone or in combination: 43 (73%) presented with stroke, 22 (37%) with transient ischemic attack, 12 (20%) with seizures, 7 (12%) with headache, 3 (5%) with choreiform movements, and 2 (3%) with hemorrhage; MMD was incidentally detected in 2 patients (3%). Five patients had unilateral MMD at presentation, but 3 of these ultimately progressed to develop bilateral MMD after an average of 16 months; therefore, pial synangiosis was ultimately performed in a total of 116 hemispheres during the study period. Clinical follow-up was available at a median interval of 20.6 years (IQR 16.1-23.2 years). Modified Rankin Scale scores were stable or improved in 43 of 50 patients with evaluable data; 45 of 55 are currently independent. There were 6 patient deaths (10.2%; 3 due to intracranial hemorrhage, 2 due to tumor-related complications, and 1 due to pulmonary artery stenosis), 4 of whom had a history of previous cranial radiation. One patient (1.7%) experienced a late stroke. Synangiosis vessels remained patent on all available late MRI and MRA studies. Four patients reported uneventful pregnancies and vaginal deliveries years following their revascularization procedures. CONCLUSIONS Revascularization for MMD by pial synangiosis appears to confer protection from stroke for pediatric patients over long-term follow-up. A history of cranial radiation was present in 4 of the 6 patients who died and in the lone patient with late stroke. Most patients can expect productive, independent lives following revascularization surgery in the absence of significant preoperative neurological deficits and comorbidities.",2019,Neurosciences & Neurology; Pediatrics; Surgery
Surgical factors and complications affecting hospital outcome in redo mitral surgery: insights from a multicentre experience,Mitral surgery; Redo; Mitral repair; Outcomes; Valve disease; Mitral valve; CARDIAC-SURGERY; VALVE SURGERY; RISK-FACTORS; REPLACEMENT; MORTALITY; IMPLANTATION; REOPERATION; STERNOTOMY; FAILURE; REENTRY,"OBJECTIVES: Several single-centre experiences have reported significant operative mortality and morbidity after mitral valve surgery in redo scenarios (ReMVS). Several preoperative risk factors outlining 'high-risk' categories have been reported, but scanty data on the impact of different operative techniques for these major challenging procedures have been analysed to date. The aim of the study is to investigate those intraoperative factors and postoperative events affecting early survival after redo mitral procedures. METHODS: Operative mortality and major morbidity events from a large multicentre registry enrolling 832 consecutive redo mitral procedures were analysed. Intraoperative technical issues and postoperative complications impacting operative mortality were identified. RESULTS: ReMVS was associated with significant operative mortality (12.5%), acute myocardial infarction (AMI; 5.9%), stroke (4.9%), acute respiratory insufficiency (14.8%), pneumonia (7.0%), acute renal insufficiency (16.1%) and failure (12.6%), reintervention for bleeding (7.6%), massive transfusion (28.0%), need for permanent pacemaker (10.1%). Injury of a previous patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft [odds ratio (OR) 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-11.5; P = 0.005], major cardiovascular iatrogenic lesions at re-entry (OR 19.2, 95% CI: 9.2-39.9; P < 0.001), extracellular crystalloid cardioplegia (OR 7.3, 95% CI: 1.4-37.8; P = 0.018), and incremental cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2; P = 0.001) independently predicted operative mortality, whereas combined antegrade + retrograde cardioplegia (OR 0.2, 95% CI: 0.09-0.4; P = 0.001) was the only protective factor against mortality. Among complications, AMI (OR 4.1, 95% CI: 1.8-9.6; P = 0.001), need for intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP; OR 3.1, 95% CI: 1.5-6.1; P = 0.001), prolonged intubation >48 h (OR 5.3, 95% CI: 2.9-9.4; P = 0.001) and massive (>6 units) transfusions (OR 4.4, 95% CI: 2.4-8.0; P = 0.001) also predicted operative mortality. CONCLUSIONS: ReMVS still carries the risk of significant early mortality and major morbidity. Major lesion to cardiovascular structures is the most dreadful iatrogenic complication, and injury of a previous LIMA graft identifies patients at higher risk of operative mortality. Prolonged cross-clamp times, extracellular crystalloid cardioplegia and massive transfusions have profound impact on early outcome, as well as the development of perioperative AMI, eventually requiring IABP and prolonged intubation. The combination of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia seems to offer a better myocardial protection in these high-risk patients.",2016,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery
Land use and management in Benin Republic: An evaluation of the effectiveness of Land Law 2013-01,Land Law 2013-01; Land use and management; Benin Republic; ,"Inefficient land use and management is rampant in developing countries. The most patent manifestation of this is the chaotic state of land use practices in cities. It's also demonstrated that the success of public policies and strategies in land use, urban planning, protection of natural resources, housing, agriculture, industry, transport and tourism, depends largely on the land resource management by the State and the Local Communities. Unfortunately, in the Republic of Benin, the land management is characterized by the lack of land mastership and the growing of land insecurity which did not promote sustained policy of investments and increased the failure of many peoples in Benin population, both in rural and in urban areas at the benefit of a minority. With the increasing competition for it access due to the rapid urbanization occurred in the last two decades, the land issue has become a major concern for the population and for the political and administrative authorities. To regulate the land access all over the country, in the National Assembly in May 2013, the Benin government introduced a Land Law project which was adopted by the National Assembly of Benin on the 14th of August, 2013. The law is a common framework regarding all lands; it integrates land acquisition procedures, expropriation procedures, public utility land management, environment and natural resources preservation, land property rights, conflict management, and the administrative structure for land management. But after four years of the Land Law 2013-01 being implemented, land use in Benin remains a huge challenge for the government. Indigenous settlements can often be found in wetlands and flood-prone areas along the city where communities established many years ago are exposed to urban risks and a degraded living environment in Cotonou, a major city and economic pole of Benin. The situation is worsened by the many conflicts occurring among communities due to unsecured land transactions. This study examines Land Law 2013-01 and its impact on land use and land ownership across Benin Republic. More specifically, it discusses the effectiveness and limitations of the law since its implementation. The structure of this paper is organized into five sections as follows. Section 1 introduces the context and objectives of the study. Section 2 presents a chronological evolution of land policies and the major changes in the land use from the colonial period to the post-colonial period. Section 3 introduces Land Law 2013-01. Section 4 discusses effectiveness and limitations of the law. Section 5 gives conclusions and recommendations. The key shortcomings include: a clear understanding of the multiple land access modes which is a necessary tool for sustainable land development, the legal dualism created by the coexistence of customary laws and the modem registration system, the vulnerability of legal land security and the inadequate land information management system.",2018,Environmental Sciences & Ecology
ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ASPECTS AGAINST CONTROLLING GOODS TURNOVER,counterfeit goods; illicit trafficking; infringement of intellectual property rights; copyright holder; consumer; forgery; SHADOW ECONOMY,"The purpose of this article is to describe the content of the economic and legal bases of counteraction to the circulation of counterfeit goods. Using systemic and formal-logical methods, the amount of economic losses is outlined and the magnitudes of consequences arising from the circulation of counterfeit goods for the state, patent holders, consumers and manufacturers of counterfeits are outlined. It has been stated that drugs, toys, agrochemicals, and foodstuffs are the most counterfeit at the moment and are not only supported by crime as a crime in the field of intellectual property, but also endanger the lives and healths. Considering the market of counterfeit goods described its features, which are that the operation indicated the author but due to factors such as low solvency of the population in developing countries; the inability to sell counterfeit products separately from the original products, due to the fact that the original products are used for masking in the sale of counterfeiting; lack of specialized equipment for establishing counterfeit goods and knowledge of the original; scale and narrow specialization of counterfeit goods market participants; the transnational nature of this market; splicing organized crime with law enforcement agencies; high profitability of counterfeit market. The practical importance of the research is the documentary analysis examines the international legal aspects of counterfeiting of such goods and notes that the rules of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS and the EU Customs Regulation on Intellectual Property Observance set out measures to combat trafficking in goods that infringes intellectual property rights. Consequently, successfully tackling counterfeit goods trafficking requires a constant search for innovative methods of struggle. An effective strategy for overcoming this phenomenon should combine the various measures of its counteraction, all of them should be used in a coordinated and systematic way, complementing each other. Therefore, both economic and political management methods must be taken into account to overcome the counterfeit. And only their optimal combination will have the greatest effect in the formation of concepts of counteraction to the circulation of counterfeit goods. And this is definitely worth the effort since the innovative and economic development of the state depends on solving the problem of creating an effective system of protection of intellectual property rights. Methodology. A methodological framework of the economic and legal bases of counteraction to the circulation of counterfeit goods is defined by the complex of scientific cognition methods that allow us to look at this problem as a multi-aspect, interdisciplinary phenomenon. On the basis of the system, structural, systemic-functional and other scientific approaches, the idea of counteraction to the circulation of counterfeit goods has formed a complex systemic category covering the theoretical and practical level of economic and legal activity.",2019,Business & Economics

Information from systematic zoology, conservation sciences, chemistry, forensic sciences, pathology, paleopathology, applied sciences like food industry, and most recent advances in digital imaging are put together in order to obtain a better understanding of which and possibly why mounting media and coverslip seals deteriorate, how slides can be salvaged, which studies may be necessary to identify a range of ideal mounting media, and how microscope studies can benefit from improvements in developmental biology and related fields. We also elaborate on confusing usage of concepts like that of maceration and of clearing. The chemical ingredients of a range of mounting media and coverslip seals are identified as much as possible from published data, but this information suffers in so far as the composition of a medium is often proprietary of the manufacturer and may vary over time. Advantages, disadvantages, and signs of deterioration are documented extensively for these media both from references and from our own observations. It turns out that many media degrade within a few years, or decades at the latest, except Canada balsam with a documented life-time of 150 years, Euparal with a documented life-time of 50 years, and glycerol-paraffin mounts sealed with Glyceel, which represents almost the only non-deteriorating and easily reversible mount. Deterioration reveals itself as a yellowing in natural resins and as cracking, crystallization, shrinkage on drying or possibly on loss of a plasticizer, detachment of the coverslip, segregation of the ingredients in synthetic polymers, as well as continued maceration of a specimen to a degree that the specimen virtually disappears. Confusingly, decay does not always appear equally within a collection of slides mounted at the same time in the same medium. The reasons for the deteriorative processes have been discussed but are controversial especially for gum-chloral media. Comparing data from conservation sciences, chemical handbooks, and documented ingredients, we discuss here how far chemical and physical deterioration probably are inherent to many media and are caused by the chemical and physical properties of their components and by chemicals dragged along from previous preparation steps like fixation, chemical maceration, and physical clearing. Some recipes even contain a macerating agent, which proceeds with its destructive work. We provide permeability data for oxygen and water vapor of several polymers contained in mounting media and coverslip seals. Calculation of the penetration rate of moisture in one example reveals that water molecules reach a specimen within a few days up to about a month; this lays to rest extensive discussions about the permanent protection of a mounted specimen by a mounting medium and a coverslip seal. Based on the ever growing evidence of the unsuitable composition and application of many, and possibly almost all, mounting media, we strongly encourage changing the perspective on microscope slides from immediate usability and convenience of preparation towards durability and reversibility, concepts taken from conservation sciences. Such a change has already been suggested by Upton (1993) more than 20 years ago for gum-chloral media, but these media are still encouraged nowadays by scientists. Without a new perspective, taxonomic biology will certainly lose a large amount of its specimen basis for its research within the next few decades. Modern non-invasive techniques like Raman spectroscopy may help to identify mounting media and coverslip seals on a given slide as well as to understand ageing of the media. An outlook is given on potential future studies. In order to improve the situation of existing collections of microscope slides, we transfer concepts as per the Smithsonian Collections Standards and Profiling System, developed for insect collections more than 25 years ago, to collections of slides. We describe historical and current properties and usage of glass slides, coverslips, labels, and adhesives under conservational aspects. In addition, we summarize and argue from published and our own experimental information about restorative procedures, including re-hydration of dried-up specimens previously mounted in a fluid medium. Alternatives to microscope slides are considered. We also extract practical suggestions from the literature concerning microscope equipment, cleaning of optical surfaces, health risks of immersion oil, and recent improvements of temporary observation media especially in connection with new developments in digital software.",2017,Zoology

We find a nonmonotonic effect of patent protection on innovation. Additionally, the growth-rate-maximizing degree of patent protection decreases when the strength of status preference is larger. The effect of patent protection on social welfare is ambiguous, depending on the strength of status preference. Moreover, wealth inequality widens as patent protection is reinforced. Finally, by using cross-section regression analysis, we document that a nonmonotonic relationship between patent protection and economic growth is statistically significant and that the growth-rate-maximizing degree of patent protection decreases with the strength of status preference.",2018,Business & Economics

If the market size increases with number of firms, patent protection reduces R&D investment if the cost of R&D is sufficiently high, and higher product differentiation increases the possibility of lower R&D investment under patent protection. If the market size does not increase with number of firms, patent protection never reduces R&D investment. We find that welfare is lower under patent protection than under no patent protection.",2017,Business & Economics

Intellectual property right protection in the software market,Copyright protection; software patent; intellectual property right; PATENTS,"We discuss the software patent should be granted or not. There exist two types of coping in the software market; reverse engineering and software duplication. Software patent can prevent both types of copies since a patent protects an invention. If the software is not protected by a patent, software producer cannot prevent reverse engineering. However, the producer can prevent the software duplication by a copyright. It is not clear the software patent is socially desirable when we consider these two types of coping. We obtain the following results. First, the number of copy users under the patent protection is greater than that under the copyright protection. Second, the government can increase social welfare by applying copyright protection when the new technology is sufficiently innovative.",2018,Business & Economics
Economic growth under two forms of intellectual property rights protection: patents and trade secrets,Innovation; Patent; Trade secret; Dynamic general equilibrium; INNOVATION; FIRMS,"This paper analyzes the effects on growth of strengthened patent protections, where trade secrets are introduced as an additional protection method. Strengthening patent protection decreases the amount of common knowledge, which has two asymmetric effects on incentives to innovate. First, as competitors cannot freely use technological information, it helps successful innovators earn higher profits. Second, less disclosure of information reduces R&D productivity. The model shows that the relative importance of patents versus trade secrets determines whether the former positive effect dominates the latter negative effect. As a result, strengthened patent protection can increase economic growth when the risk of leakage of trade secrets is high. Conversely, when the risk is low, stronger patent protection hinders growth. Similar opposing results are also found in welfare analysis.",2015,Business & Economics

If South is free to deny patent protection, CL fails to arise in equilibrium and the option to use it makes both parties worse off. If South is obliged to offer patent protection, CL can occur and even yield a Pareto improvement.

The impact of patent protection and financial development on industrial R&D,R&D; Financial development; Patent protection; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INNOVATION; QUALITY; CONSTRAINTS; SIGNALS,"Stronger protection of patent rights is thought to spur innovation through securing returns to R&D investments. Those investments must be financed, however, suggesting that the responsiveness of R&D to patent reforms varies with financial development levels. We examine the joint impact of domestic and international financial market development and patent protection on R&D intensities in 22 manufacturing industries in 20 OECD countries for the period 1990-2009. We show that stronger patent rights increase R&D intensities in patent-intensive industries, accounting for the need for external financing and the amount of tangible assets. The primary impact varies across types of financial development: patent protection raises R&D in high-patent industries where countries have more limited equity and credit markets. In contrast, in countries with more developed bond markets industry R&D is more sensitive to patent rights. Interestingly, patent rights in countries that are more exposed to foreign direct investment increase R&D intensities at all levels of financial development.",2019,Business & Economics
How to create commercial value from patents: the role of patent management,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; APPROPRIATION; PERFORMANCE; PROTECTION; FRAMEWORK; FIRMS,"This article examines the relationship between patent management and indicators of a firm's financial and patenting performance. The empirical analyses are based on a sample of 158 technology-based firms from the United States and Germany across multiple industries. The results show that two important dimensions of patent management, specifically patent protection management and patent information management, are positively correlated with a firm's level of financial profitability and the strategic and financial impact of its patent portfolio. This implies that patent protection and information management are important managerial capabilities of the firm that determine the level of value it can create from patents. We further find that a firm's technology strategy moderates the relationship between patent protection management and firm performance; it does, however, not moderate the relationship between patent information management and firm performance. Hence, the effectiveness of certain managerial capabilities on value creation from patents are contingent upon specific boundary conditions. Our findings have implications for improving firm performance through patent management.",2016,Business & Economics

When trade is not subject to any frictions/barriers, requiring national treatment (NT) does not affect the rate of innovation (and welfare) since unfavorable discrimination suffered abroad by innovators in the absence of NT is fully offset by favorable discrimination enjoyed by them at home. When trade barriers exist, however, such international offsetting in patent protection is incomplete and innovation incentives are actually lower under NT. By lumping domestic and foreign patent protection together, NT blunts the overall effectiveness of patent protection in incentivizing innovation in the presence of trade barriers.

This note considers incomplete information framework where the spillover parameter is private information. In this framework it is shown that there are situations where patent protection unambiguously increases incentive for R&D.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY STARTUPS: WHAT ENTREPRENEURS TELL US,Copyrights; trademarks; trade secrets; patents; entrepreneurship; PATENTS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; COPYRIGHT,"This chapter provides evidence on how young technology startups are employing intellectual property (IP) protection when innovating and competing in the United States. Although researchers and teachers of university technology transfer often think only in terms of patents and the Bayh-Dole Act, this chapter suggests that adopting a more nuanced view of IP rights is appropriate. After reviewing the primary non-patent types of IP protection available in the U.S. (copyright, trademark, and trade secret), we explain that while patents are often considered the strongest protection, for some entrepreneurs - particularly those operating in the U.S. software and Internet sectors - patents may be the least important means of capturing value from innovation. We present evidence from the 2008 Berkeley Patent Survey to demonstrate that IP is used by U.S. startups in very different ways, and to different effects, across technology sectors and other company-specific characteristics. Contrary to the common assumption in academic discourse, we show that different forms of IP protection often serve as complements, rather than substitutes.",2016,Business & Economics

Effects of patents versus R&D subsidies on income inequality,R&D subsidies; Patents; Income inequality; Economic growth; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; CONSUMPTION INEQUALITY; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; BLOCKING PATENTS; TECHNICAL CHANGE; MODEL; POLICY; PROTECTION; LIFE,"This study explores the effects of patent protection and R&D subsidies on innovation and income inequality using a Schumpeterian growth model with heterogeneous households. We find that although strengthening patent protection and raising R&D subsidies have the same macroeconomic effects of stimulating innovation and economic growth, they have drastically different microeconomic implications on income inequality. Specifically, strengthening patent protection increases income inequality whereas raising R&D subsidies decreases (increases) it if the quality step size is sufficiently small (large). An empirically realistic quality step size is smaller than the threshold, implying a negative effect of R&D subsidies on income inequality. We also calibrate the model to provide a quantitative analysis and find that strengthening patent protection causes a moderate increase in income inequality and a negligible increase in consumption inequality whereas raising R&D subsidies causes a relatively large decrease in both income inequality and consumption inequality.

We look at changes in patenting behavior by domestic and foreign applicants at the national patent offices and the European Patent Office (EPO). We find a strong change in patent filing behavior among foreigners seeking patent protection in the accession states, substituting EPO patents for domestic patents immediately. However, there is no discernible reaction among domestic entities in terms of domestic filings, although we do find some evidence that applicants in accession states increased their propensity to file patents with the EPO post-accession. Inventors in accession countries also increase their patent filings slightly post-accession, both at the EPO and at the national offices.",2019,Business & Economics
Ethical reasons for narrowing the scope of biotech patents,Biotech patents; IP rights; Myriad Genetics; Patent scope; Purpose-bound compound protection; ,"Patents on biotech products have a scope that goes well beyond what is covered by the most widely applied ethical justifications of intellectual property. Neither natural rights theory from Locke, nor public interest theory of IP rights justifies the wide scope of legal protection. The article takes human genes as an example, focusing on the component that is not invented but persists as unaltered gene information even in the synthetically produced complementary DNA, the cDNA. It is argued that patent on cDNA holds this information captive, or illegitimately appropriates it in limiting other researchers and inventors' opportunity to explore new functions and uses based on this non-invented information. A tighter connection between legal IP protection and the use description stated in the patent claim is suggested. By binding protection to the product's foreseeable functions and use, instead of the product itself and all future uses of it, legitimacy of biotech product patents is restored.",2015,Social Sciences - Other Topics; History & Philosophy of Science
First mover advantages and optimal patent protection,Technological innovation; Intellectual property or patents; Product differentiation; ,"This paper examines the economic logic underlying so-called first mover advantages as alternatives to patent protection in allowing innovators protection from immediate imitation and time to recoup their research and development investments. These include a head start, lower costs due to learning by doing, and product-differentiating reputational advantages. William Nordhaus' theory of optimal patent protection is extended to cases of product, as distinguished from cost-saving, innovation. Over the parameters covered by a simulation analysis, profit potentials sufficient to induce R&D investment are found much more frequently than R&D incentive failures. R&D failures occur most commonly in small markets and situations in which imitators' erosion of the innovator's market share is particularly rapid. Implications for patent policy are drawn.",2015,Engineering; Business & Economics

Firms' R&D investments increase as the patent's expiration date approaches. Through forward protection, followers internalize the leader's replacement effect. In protective systems, this internalization is substantial, reversing Arrow's traditional result: followers invest less than leaders at every moment of the patent's life. I study the policy that maximizes innovative activity. Overly protective policies decrease innovation pace through two mechanisms: delaying firms' investments toward the end of the patent's life and decreasing the number of firms performing R&D.",2019,Business & Economics

(2012), which features a blocking patent on vertical R&D. Results show that strengthening patent protection on horizontal R&D promotes vertical innovation (quality improvement) but hinders horizontal innovation (variety expansion). This effect of a horizontal blocking patent on directionality of innovation is opposite to that of the vertical blocking patent analyzed by Chu et at (2012). Results also show that under mild conditions, strengthening a blocking patent on horizontal innovation as well as on vertical innovation can increase economic growth and social welfare.

"Imperfect patent protection, licensing, and Social Welfare",; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PERSISTENCE; INNOVATION,"The paper analyzes an entry game where, in the presence of imperfect patent protection, a patent holder of a cost-reducing innovation can propose either an exclusive license, that preserves the incumbent's monopolistic position, or a sole license, compatible with the entry and the duopolistic competition. We prove that, since the threat of imitation reduces the values of the license, the innovator may be forced to enter the market. The impact of low patent protection on expected welfare is twofold: the increased uncertainty, reducing R&D returns appropriability, forces the licensor to enter the market; however, it may reduce the incentive to innovate. As a consequence, a rise in the level of patent protection causes a trade-off between the increased incentive to innovate and the reduced allocative efficiency in the market.",2019,Business & Economics

We offer such an analysis using data from Germany. We find that larger firms are more likely to use both protection methods. Moreover, a short life cycle of products and services is associated with an increased likelihood to use UMs. The features and functioning of the German UM system are of broader interest because it has been a benchmark for several second tier patent protection systems around the world.",2018,Business & Economics
"Patent rights, product market reforms, and innovation",Intellectual property rights; Competition; Innovation; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; COMPETITION; PROTECTION; STIMULATE; INDUSTRY; PROGRAM; POLICY; GROWTH; LEVEL; PANEL,"In this paper, we provide empirical evidence to the effect that strong patent rights may complement competition-increasing product market reforms in fostering innovation. First, we find that the product market reform induced by the large-scale internal market reform of the European Union in 1992 enhanced, on average, innovative investments in manufacturing industries of countries with strong patent rights since the pre-sample period, but not so in industries of countries with weaker patent rights. Second, the positive response to the product market reform is more pronounced in industries where, in general, innovators tend to value patent protection higher than in other industries, except for the manufacture of electrical and optical equipment. The observed complementarity between competition and patent protection can be rationalized using a Schumpeterian growth model with step-by-step innovation. In such a model, better patent protection prolongs the period over which a firm that successfully escapes competition by innovating, actually enjoys higher monopoly rents from its technological upgrade.",2015,Business & Economics

Thus, it is worth analyzing patents and trademarks at the same time to examine innovation-protection mechanisms considering that not only patents but also trademarks can play a significant role in protecting different aspects of innovation. In response, this paper focuses on the usage of trademarks and suggests hybrid intellectual property strategies to integrate patents and trademarks to understand the characteristics of innovation strategy-the patterns of innovation protection.

The University of Chicago Law Review,; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; COMPUTER-PROGRAMS; PATENT; SOFTWARE; DOCTRINE; DESIGN,"Intellectual property regimes frequently employ boundary screens. Boundary screens protect the different balances of competition and protection that Congress has struck in the different regimes by preventing the goods whose protectability should be determined by one regime from infiltrating into and receiving protection under another regime. Prior scholarship on boundary screens offers in-depth analyses of the functionality screens in nonpatent intellectual property that avoid upsetting patent law's competition protection balance for functional innovation. This Article turns the table, asking a previously unasked question about how patent's authorship screen that is, its boundary screen that prevents infiltration by the authorial innovation that is the proper domain of copyright does and should work. Shortcomings in patent's authorship screen upset copyright's competition protection balance, allowing patents to function as abnormally thick backdoor copyrights, just as shortcomings in copyright's functionality screen allow copyrights to function as abnormally long and easy-to obtain backdoor patents. In addition to its normative assessment of the authorship screen's importance as a barrier to backdoor copyrights and its descriptive analysis of the statutorily diffuse set of patent doctrines that collectively enforce the authorship screen, this Article presents case studies focusing on architectural innovation, an unstudied zone of overlap on the copyright patent boundary that illustrates the authorship screen in action.",2017,Government & Law
Does knowledge tradeability make secrecy more attractive than patents? An analysis of IPR strategies and licensing,; SAMPLE SELECTION; PROBIT; PROPERTY; MODEL,"Despite the considerable protection provided by the patent system, a surprisingly small number of firms use patents, instead favouring the use of secrecy. This suggests that natural market forces protect inventors so that formal protections are not necessary. Using firm-level data, this study provides the first empirical evidence on the relationship between knowledge tradeability and the choice of IPR protection methods. Consistent with recent theoretical results, we find that firms engaged in licensing agreements are more likely to use secrecy than patents and that the largest R&D investors tend to use secrecy more than patents. Also, large firms, or manufacturing firms of any size are more likely to use patents, whilst firms that obtain information from internal and non-market sources are more inclined to use secrecy.",2016,Business & Economics

In particular, we investigate an innovator's investment strategy and the efficiency of policies from a dynamics perspective. We show that perfect patent protection is optimal under symmetric information, whereas this is not so if the licensor has private information. Furthermore, we show that social welfare under asymmetric information is higher than that under symmetric information for most patent protection levels, yet the latter dominates the former in the presence of an optimal policy for each regime. An R&D subsidy is found suboptimal under symmetric information, whereas it can be optimal given information asymmetry. This allows us to derive a combination of patent protection and R&D subsidy that yields the first-best results under asymmetric information in multiple industries simultaneously.",2019,Business & Economics
The Economic Theory of Patent Protection and Pandemic Influenza Vaccines: Do Patents Really Incentivize Innovation in the Field?,; GLOBAL PRODUCTION; TRADE AGREEMENTS; PROPERTY RULES; ACCESS; PREPAREDNESS; VACCINATION; BIOSIMILARS; COMPETITION; MEDICINES; HEALTH,"The creation of new vaccines is one of the key challenges in the battle against global infectious diseases. Therefore, creating the optimal conditions for innovation in vaccines is one of the most important roles law may undertake in this battle. In relation to pharmaceuticals, the economic theory of patent protection is commonly cited by industry and in the academic literature to justify the patenting of life-saving medicines and vaccines. The economic theory of patent protection holds that innovation occurs due to patents protecting the research and development investment made by the innovator. Proponents of this theory claim that without patents such innovation in medicines and vaccines would occur at a significantly reduced rate. This Article considers the applicability of the economic theory of patent protection to pandemic influenza vaccines. This Article examines a number of factors relevant to patent law, theory, and innovation including: the patent landscape for pandemic influenza vaccines; the market dominance enjoyed by manufacturers; the actual risk posed by imitators making generic vaccines if patent protection were not in place; and, the licensing and regulatory provisions for creating generic vaccines. According to the economic theory of patent protection, a patent incentivizes innovation by providing an innovator with a temporary monopoly regarding their innovation, and by protecting them from the threat posed by imitators who wish to make a cheap replica of the product. However, even without a patent, pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturers are in this position. Due to economies of scale and the complicated regulatory and licensing frameworks relevant to bringing a pandemic influenza vaccine to market, manufacturers are at little to no risk from generic imitators. Moreover, there is a very strong incentive to innovate because pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturers are selling a product for which demand exceeds supply to a captive market of nations and organizations, each of which is hoping to secure as much vaccine as possible. The unique conditions associated with pandemic influenza vaccines appear to provide more of an incentive to innovate and research in this field than the fact that the innovations can be patented.",2016,Government & Law

Effects of a blocking patent on R&D with endogenous survival activities,Intellectual property rights; Blocking patents; Endogenous growth; Firm survival; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; QUALITY; POLICY,"This study analyzes the effect of strengthening patent protection for innovation and economic growth by introducing a blocking patent into the endogenous growth model developed by Furukawa (Econ Lett 121(1):26-29, 2013a), which features survival activity of patent holders in the R&D sector with a variety-expansion model. Results show that strengthening patent protection can raise the economic growth rate and social welfare through an endogenous survival investment. Additionally, this study examines the effects of increasing subsidies for R&D. We find that increasing R&D subsidy rate can negatively affect economic growth and social welfare because of the investment for survival activities. This result shows the novel role of a blocking patent in determining innovation effects of R&D subsidies. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of patent breadth which is another patent instrument in this model on innovation and economic growth. Results show that the growth and welfare effects of the profit-division rule and the subsidy rate for R&D may vary with the size of patent breadth.",2018,Business & Economics

NON-JURISDICTIONAL FORMS OF PATENT RIGHTS PROTECTION IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION,protection of patent rights; non-jurisdictional forms; self-defense; claim; warning; mediation; ,"This article discusses the features of the implementation of non-jurisdictional forms of protection of civil rights (self-defense, claims, mediation) in relation to patent infringements in the Russian Federation. It is noted that the self-defense of patent rights by classical means in non-contractual legal relations is limited due to the peculiarities of the legal nature of the objects of patent rights, namely because of their intangible nature, the general availability of information about them, the presence of state registration, but it is possible to use special means of self-defense: software and hardware, introduction trade secrets, optimization of patenting and legal protection strategies as know-how.

Patenting human genes: Chinese academic articles' portrayal of gene patents,Human gene patents; Chinese scholars; Patentability; CONTROVERSY; PROTECTION; MYRIAD,"Background: The patenting of human genes has been the subject of debate for decades. While China has gradually come to play an important role in the global genomics-based testing and treatment market, little is known about Chinese scholars' perspectives on patent protection for human genes. Methods: A content analysis of academic literature was conducted to identify Chinese scholars' concerns regarding gene patents, including benefits and risks of patenting human genes, attitudes that researchers hold towards gene patenting, and any legal and policy recommendations offered for the gene patent regime in China. Results: 57.2% of articles were written by law professors, but scholars from health sciences, liberal arts, and ethics also participated in discussions on gene patent issues. While discussions of benefits and risks were relatively balanced in the articles, 63.5% of the articles favored gene patenting in general and, of the articles (n = 41) that explored gene patents in the Chinese context, 90.2% supported patent protections for human genes in China. The patentability of human genes was discussed in 33 articles, and 75.8% of these articles reached the conclusion that human genes are patentable. Conclusion: Chinese scholars view the patent regime as an important legal tool to protect the interests of inventors and inventions as well as the genetic resources of China. As such, many scholars support a gene patent system in China. These attitudes towards gene patents remain unchanged following the court ruling in the Myriad case in 2013, but arguments have been raised about the scope of gene patents, in particular that the increasing numbers of gene patents may negatively impact public health in China.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics; Biomedical Social Sciences
An Empirical Analysis of Primary and Secondary Pharmaceutical Patents in Chile,; PROTECTION,"We analyze the patent filing strategies of foreign pharmaceutical companies in Chile distinguishing between primary (active ingredient) and secondary patents (patents on modified compounds, formulations, dosages, particular medical uses, etc.). There is prior evidence that secondary patents are used by pharmaceutical originator companies in the U.S. and Europe to extend patent protection on drugs in length and breadth. Using a novel dataset that comprises all drugs registered in Chile between 1991 and 2010 as well as the corresponding patents and trademarks, we find evidence that foreign originator companies pursue similar strategies in Chile. We find a primary to secondary patents ratio of 1:4 at the drug-level, which is comparable to the available evidence for Europe; most secondary patents are filed over several years following the original primary patent and after the protected active ingredient has obtained market approval in Chile. This points toward effective patent term extensions through secondary patents. Secondary patents dominate older therapeutic classes like anti-ulcer and anti-depressants. In contrast, newer areas like anti-virals and anti-neoplastics (anti-cancer) have a much larger share of primary patents.",2015,Science & Technology - Other Topics

While previous studies have usually considered patents and trade secrets as substitutes for one another, we investigate to what extent and in what situations the two protection methods are used jointly. We identify protection strategies for single innovation firms and hence overcome the assignment problem of existing empirical studies, that is, whether firms using both protection methods do so for the same innovation or for different innovations. Employing firm panel data from Germany, we find fairly few differences between the determinants for choosing secrecy and patenting. Single innovators that combine both strategies, 39% of the group, tend to aim at a higher level of innovation and act in a more uncertain technological environment. Firms combining both protection methods yield significantly higher sales with new-to-market innovations, providing some evidence for a complementarity of the two protection methods.",2019,Business & Economics
"Tailored Treatment, Tailored Enforcement: Protecting Innovation in Personalized Medicine from a Patent-Protection Loophole",; ,"A once obscure patent law doctrine, divided infringement, threatens the future of innovation in life-saving medical treatments. This anomaly, shaped by software patent cases but applicable to enforcement of any method patent, provides a patent-protection loophole for certain infringers. Divided infringement has generated much discussion and a recent Supreme Court decision, Limelight v. Akamai, because of its effect on patent protection for computer networking technology. But this incongruity in patent enforcement also has notable implications for development of personalized-medicine and other patentable medical-treatment methods. Various solutions to the problem posed by divided infringement how to hold multiple individuals collectively responsible for infringing a method patent have been suggested elsewhere. One of the most logical proposals is that whoever finishes a patented method by implementing the method's last step infringes the method as a whole. Such a broad rule, however, might be opposed by those fearful of provoking yet more disputes over software patents. This Note proposes a more targeted rule for medical-method patent cases: that the healthcare provider who uses a medical-treatment method commits direct infringement of a patent on that method despite enlisting another party to perform diagnostic testing or drug administration steps intrinsic to the method. This proposed theory of infringement would provide a predicate for lawsuits against culpable competitor companies through standard indirect or vicarious liability theories.",2016,Government & Law
The American Inventors Protection Act: A Natural Experiment on Innovation Disclosure and the Cost of Debt,; PATENTS,"We examine the impact of innovation disclosure through patenting on firms' cost of debt, focusing on the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA) as an exogenous shock in innovation disclosure regulation. Post-AIPA, firms have an incentive to apply for patents only if commercial success is likely. Accordingly, we expect post-AIPA patents to be a better proxy for successful innovation activity, and thus to have a stronger effect on reducing the cost of debt than pre-AIPA patents. Indeed, we find that pre-AIPA patents reduce the cost of debt only for the most innovative firms, while post-AIPA, this effect holds for all firms.",2019,Business & Economics

The heterogeneous effect of software patents on expected returns: Evidence from India,Patents; Software; Innovation; India; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; COUNTRIES,We contribute to the literature on the role of patenting for economic development by analyzing the impact of patent protection for software in India. We find that a proposed broadening of patent eligibility to include software in 2004 had a large positive effect on average returns for listed software companies in India. An unanticipated reversal of this proposed policy change in 2005 resulted in substantial negative returns. We illustrate substantial heterogeneity in the dynamics of these effects across the sequence of events. We also find smaller firms to have been systematically and most significantly affected by the tightening of patent law with regard to software patents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This literature typically omits patent law from the argument, reflecting an implicit assumption that patent protection poses no threat to free speech. This assumption is wrong. As this Article will explain, patents can restrict free speech just as much as copyrights and trademarks. Indeed, patents often pose an even greater threat to speech than do copyrights and trademarks: precisely because people assume that patents pose no threat to speech, patent law has developed none of the doctrinal safeguards for free speech that copyright law and trademark law have incorporated. This Article makes two contributions. First, it makes the point that patents are not exceptional and raise the same free speech issues as the rest of IP law. Second, it proposes some doctrinal limits on patent protection to mitigate the speech-restrictive effects of patent law.",2019,Government & Law

As a result, the determinants of a firm's propensity to patent in a weak appropriability regime are still unclear. This paper advances our current understanding of patent behavior by exploring the effects of manufacturing firms' innovation partnerships, foreign ownership, and adoption of new management practices on the likelihood of patenting. Our analysis is based on the responses of firms to questions in the Brazilian Industrial Survey of Technological Innovation (Pintec). The findings presented here indicate that, despite the weaknesses of the patent system, firms engaged in innovation-oriented collaborations are more likely to patent than firms not involved in these partnerships. Additionally, the results reveal that domestic and foreign firms in a weak institutional environment are similar in their inclination to patent. Finally, the empirical exercise shows that when a patent system is characterized by high levels of formalism and low levels of safeguarding against infringements of property rights firms adopt novel management practices as substitutes for patents.

Should they translate their increasing economic strength into political power to further developing countries' interests in lower levels of international patent protection? Or, anticipating a rising domestic interest in stronger international patent protection, should they adopt a position that favours maximal patent protection? Drawing on multiple case studies using a most-similar system design, we argue that rising economies, after having been coerced into adopting more stringent patent standards, tend to display ambivalent positions, trapped in bureaucratic politics and caught between conflicting domestic constituencies. We find that the recent proliferation of international institutions and the expansion of transnational networks have contributed to fragmentation and polarisation in domestic patent politics. As a result, today's emerging economies experience a more tortuous transformative process than did yesterday's. This finding is of particular relevance for scholars studying rising powers, as well as for those working on policy diffusion, regulatory regimes, transnational networks and regime complexes.",2018,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
On the optimality of IPR protection with blocking patents,Blocking patents; Economic growth; Optimal patent instruments; Subsidies; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; POLICY; ECONOMICS; INNOVATION; SUBSIDIES; INFRINGEMENT; COMPETITION; LESSONS; LENGTH,"This paper develops a Schumpeterian growth model with overlapping intellectual property rights to analyze the effects of patent protection that features two policy instruments: patent breadth and the profit-division rule between sequential innovators. The former determines the markup and profits of firms, whereas the latter determines the degree to which a patent blocks the subsequent invention. Elastic labor supply and subsidies for intermediate goods and research are also considered. The main results are as follows. First, patents and subsidies are substitutable in eliminating the distortions of this model. Second. given the limited use of subsidies in practice, we study optimal patent protection with exogenous subsidies and derive the coordination of patent instruments attaining the social optimum. Third, optimizing only the profit-division rule retains the first-best R&D level and growth rate, but optimizing only patent breadth could lead to under- or over-investment in R&D: either of these cases is less welfare-enhancing than optimizing their mix. Finally, the model is calibrated to quantify the welfare gains from the decentralized equilibrium to the outcomes with the optimal patent instrument(s), and these welfare improvements can be substantially large. Hence, this study sheds some light on the optimal design and welfare implications of a patent system that is multidimensional and blocks future innovations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Revisiting the Principle of Technological Neutrality in Patent Protection in the Age of 3D Printing Technology and Cloud Computing,; ,"Contemporary patent laws based on the norms of the WTO-TRIPS Agreement seem to be driven toward technological neutrality and universal applicability. In most countries, a technologically neutral standard of patentability applies in a non-discriminating manner, regardless of the field of technology, and regardless of the identity of the inventor and the place of the invention. Neutrality in the substantive aspects of patent laws, among others, now extends to the subject matter neutrality-that the availability of patent protection is not tied to the technological field and neutrality in the enjoyment of the right. In contrast to this neutral outlook of contemporary patent law, subjective policy aspects of patent law have long been part of patent law making. For society, the need for an economic and innovation policy not to subject to a certain field of industry to patenting still exists. As a matter of practice, the need to differentiate various technological fields so as to determine exact parameters for substantive patent examination continues to exist. New emerging technologies such as cloud computing and 3D printing are good examples. This paper reviews the notion of technological neutrality in patent protection and its meaning in the age of 3D printing and cloud computing. Both of these technologies are further instances of computer programming technology in which the industry is currently defining its own field of activity, and where the copying of the expression may lead to the exploitation of ideas, literally. Using these two new technologies as examples of subject matters where not only the standard of patent eligibility but also exploitation is questioned, this paper will examine the exact parameters of technological specificity set down in the TRIPS principle of neutrality of patent protection and explore to what extent and manner the future international patent norm should consider the principle of neutrality.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law

PVP breeders' exemption weakens IP protection, but may speed the transfer of research gains across firms. A model is developed assuming firms optimise research given existing IP protection. A baseline scenario supporting each system is used to perform welfare analysis, and study how the balance is altered between systems. Survey data suggest patents are more appropriate for longer-term, higher-risk research, whereas PVP is better suited for traditional breeding.

FORMATION OF LEGAL PROTECTION OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE BY THE RULES OF COPYRIGHT AND PATENT LAW,legal protection of computer programs; copyright; patent law; ,"Introduction. Computer programs (CP) are one of the newest objects of intellectual property. Neither the norms of copyright or patent law, nor attempts to develop separate legislation have enabled creating a legal mechanism that would not cause significant complaints from stakeholders. Problem Statement. An analysis of the historical factors that led to the choice of different approaches to the legal protection of computer programs enables to better understand the system in each country, to choose the most appropriate ways to acquire the rights and protection of these objects of intellectual property, to defend their property and non-property rights, and to look for new, more reasonable and efficient ways of solving problems in this field. Purpose. To study the world history of the formation and development of legal protection of computer software by the rules of copyright and patent law. Materials and Methods. Critical review of literary sources on intellectual properly and computer science, comparative analysis of international and national legislation of various countries, study of judicial practice that has had the greatest impact on the practical solution to the problem of protecting computer programs. Results. The main stages in the history of the development and formation of ways of legal protection of computer programs have been identified and characterized. Intellectual properly and computer sciences materials, international and national legislation of different countries, jurisprudence, the most important historical events and outstanding inventions in this field have been analyzed. The dominant position of the computer program copyright protection has been established not always to correspond with the rights and interests of their authors who increasingly support the introduction of alternative, patent and legal protection of computer programs by special legislation rather than by the precedent law. Conclusions. It has been proposed to introduce a hybrid copyright-patent way of CP legal protection, which would combine the advantages of both methods, as a compromise solution to the problem of competition between the CP legal protection by means of the copyright and patent law.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics

When patents matter: The impact of competition and patent age on the performance contribution of intellectual property rights protection,Patents; Firm performance; Competition; Timing; Innovation policy; COMMON METHOD VARIANCE; START-UPS; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; FIRMS,"The question whether patenting impacts patenting firms' subsequent financial performance is important for technology-oriented companies. However, relevant research has led to contradictory results. We strive to overcome this impasse by introducing innovation competition and patent age as moderators of patents' performance contribution into the discourse. Based on a sample of 975 cases from diverse industries, we find strong support for our arguments. In line with our expectations, the results show that the number of patents granted, the degree of patent competition, and the timeliness of a patent contribute positively to financial performance. Moderation analysis nuances our findings by showing that the impact of patent protection on financial performance is stronger when the patent competition is stronger and the patents are younger. These findings provide insights into the conditions under which patenting leads to higher financial performance. Our findings highlight the importance of innovation competition and patent age for innovation research. The empirical results show firms that patenting pays and that, in order to tap the full potential of patents, they need to focus on emerging competing industries and reduce the time to market. Policy makers learn that patenting is a successful approach to foster innovation at limited social costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Harmonisation and globalisation of intellectual property culture,foreign patenting; globalisation; harmonisation; intellectual property culture; Southern innovation; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; MULTINATIONAL ACTIVITY; RIGHTS; INNOVATION; TRADE; GRAVITY; MODEL,"This paper explores the relationship between the two sides of intellectual property culture in an international context, namely the harmonisation of its protection and the globalisation of its creation. To this end, we explore the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the recent surge in the internationalisation of patents that originates from the newly emerging economies. The aim is to capture the outreach of the Northern intellectual property culture to the South and the South-North globalisation of the resulting intellectual property that emerges in the South. Global bilateral patent data are used to investigate the location specificity of IPR enforcement for the emergence of this phenomenon. We find that the harmonisation of IPR protection encourages foreign-patenting activities of Southern innovators. Our findings suggest that a global convergence of IPR protection can stimulate the production and the internationalisation of intellectual property in the South. As the North and the South grow closer in terms of levels of development, a harmonised institutional structure becomes more adequate as they increasingly share similar markets.",2018,Business & Economics; International Relations
The role of utility models in patent filing strategies: evidence from European countries,Patent; Utility model; Patent family; Priority filing; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; QUALITY; INDICATORS; PROTECTION; OFFICE; FAMILIES; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES; SYSTEMS; INDEX,"We examine the role of utility models (UM) in patent filing strategies. With an extensive patent family data from European countries, we explore the structures and characteristics of patent families, which include UMs. A simple typology of patent families with UM members is introduced. We document that the geographical scope of most patent families with UM members is purely national, which is in line with the conventional view that the UM mechanism covers technologically and economically marginal inventions. However, the image of a UM as a signal of a minor invention is an oversimplification. Applicants exhibit a mixture of uses for the UM and there exists a subset of UM filings linked to inventions the inventive step of which meets or exceeds the threshold required for patent protection. Some UMs are members of international patent families, indicating that applicants may have some strategic motives to use UMs in international filing. The findings highlight that both types of IPR documents (UMs and patents) should be taken into account when working with data on patent families, analyzing patent filing strategies, and constructing patent-based indicators such as patenting propensities.",2018,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science
Is Patent Evergreening Restricting Access to Medicine/Device Combination Products?,; ALBUTEROL INHALERS,"Background Not all new drug products are truly new. Some are the result of marginal innovation and incremental patenting of existing products, but in such a way that confers no major therapeutic improvement. This phenomenon, pejoratively known as evergreening, can allow manufacturers to preserve market exclusivity, but without significantly bettering the standard of care. Other studies speculate that evergreening is especially problematic for medicine/device combination products, because patents on the device component may outlast expired patents on the medicine component, and thereby keep competing, possibly less-expensive generic products off the market. Materials and Methods We focused on four common conditions that are often treated by medicine/device product combinations: asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and severe allergic reactions. The patent data for a sample of such products (n = 49) for treating these conditions was extracted fromthe United States Food and Drug Administration's Orange Book. Additional patent-related data (abstracts, claims, etc) were retrieved using LexisNexis TotalPatent. Comparisons were thenmade between each product's device patents and medicine patents. Results Unexpired device patents exist for 90 percent of the 49 medicine/device product combinations studied, and were the only sort of unexpired patent for 14 products. Overall, 55 percent of the 235 patents found by our study were device patents. Comparing the last-to-expire device patent to that of the last-to-expire active ingredient patent, the median additional years of patent protection afforded by device patents was 4.7 years (range: 1.3-15.2 years). Conclusion Incremental, patentable innovation in devices to extend the overall patent protection of medicine/device product combinations is very common. Whether this constitutes evergreening depends on whether these incremental innovations and the years of extra patent protection they confer are proportionately matched by therapeutic improvements in the standard of care, which is highly debatable.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics
Effects of Patent Protection on Optimal Corporate Income and Consumption Taxes in an R&D-Based Growth Model,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; WELFARE; TAXATION; POLICY; COUNTRIES; LABOR,"Does reducing the corporate income tax accompanied by an increase in the consumption tax to meet the government's budget constraint improve welfare? To respond, I examine the welfare-maximizing corporate income tax and consumption tax rates in an R&D-based growth model under the constraint that the government's budget is balanced at each point of time. Further, I consider how welfare-maximizing tax rates change as patent protection becomes stronger, as seen in many countries. The results show that as patent protection becomes stronger, the corporate income tax rate should be higher and the consumption tax rate should be lower. This implies that under stronger patent protection, recovering production at the expense of innovation by raising corporate income tax and reducing consumption tax improves welfare.",2016,Business & Economics

This paper constructs a multi-stage dynamic sequential game model involving the government and medicine enterprises and integrates various market and government factors into account. Next, the social welfare of monopoly pricing and government pricing are compared, while the optimal length and its correlations with the influencing factors are determined for medicine patent. It is concluded that the optimization of medicine patent length is a complex decision-making process; the optimal patent length is affected by pricing mode, government subsidy, market demand elasticity, R&D investment, marginal cost, product lifecycle and discount rate. The government should determine medicine patent length according to local conditions, rationalize medicine pricing mechanism, and develop a competitive medicine market.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Nevertheless, circumstances may still allow for generic procurement to occur anyway, especially for humanitarian cause. But to what extent does this occur? And which legal flexibilities may facilitate such procurement? We attempted to design a replicable methodology that involved linking antiretroviral (ARV) patent data (1260 patents for 12 medicines) from a World Intellectual Property Organization patent study on the 2013 World Health Organization's (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines to all available matching procurement records in the WHO's Global Price Reporting Mechanism. We then cross-referenced these with lists of legal flexibilities which facilitate generic access where patents have been granted (e.g., supplier companies' patent non-enforcement policies, voluntary and compulsory licenses) to estimate plausible relevance. The patent data corresponded to 1924 generic procurement transactions (1.34 billion units) from 85 countries. While patents were relatively less common in these countries (the median coverage was 20%), over half (53%) of the generic procurements nevertheless aligned with patent protection in the exporting and/or importing country. The disproportionately high relevance of patents despite their lower numbers can be explained by their presence in key medicine-exporting countries and/or those with larger populations. We noted, however, that developing countries still seemed able to buy generic versions of these essential ARVs. A combination of legal flexibilities may have played important roles, but voluntary licensing agreements (VLs) between originator companies and generic ones appeared to align with the largest volumes of generic procurement where we estimated patent protection. If true, VLs may warrant proportionate attention from observers as a heavily relied upon international mechanism for facilitating generic access so that the implications can be better understood; however, we hope others repeat similar studies to investigate whether these results hold with different methodologies and samples of patented medicines, contexts, and timeframes.

Instead, the data support a match-on-financing need hypothesis: ventures match with VCs, who have financial capacity to support their patent protection strategies.",2019,Business & Economics

The main findings are as follows. First, monetary policy is more effective than patent policy and the mix of these policies in terms of stimulating economic growth if initial patent protection in the economy is strong. Second, the welfare difference between patent policy and monetary policy is ambiguous, depending on the levels of predetermined instruments under these policies. However, these policy regimes are (weakly) dominated by their combination in terms of raising social welfare.",2017,Business & Economics
How Drug Life-Cycle Management Patent Strategies May Impact Formulary Management,; ,"Drug manufacturers may employ various life-cycle management patent strategies, which may impact managed care decision making regarding formulary planning and management strategies when single-source, branded oral pharmaceutical products move to generic status. Passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act enabled more rapid access to generic medications through the abbreviated new drug application process. Patent expirations of small-molecule medications and approvals of generic versions have led to substantial cost savings for health plans, government programs, insurers, pharmacy benefits managers, and their customers. However, considering that the cost of developing a single medication is estimated at $2.6 billion (2013 dollars), pharmaceutical patent protection enables companies to recoup investments, creating an incentive for innovation. Under current law, patent protection holds for 20 years from time of patent filing, although much of this time is spent in product development and regulatory review, leaving an effective remaining patent life of 7 to 10 years at the time of approval. To extend the product life cycle, drug manufacturers may develop variations of originator products and file for patents on isomers, metabolites, prodrugs, new drug formulations (eg, extended-release versions), and fixed-dose combinations. These additional patents and the complexities surrounding the timing of generic availability create challenges for managed care stakeholders attempting to gauge when generics may enter the market. An understanding of pharmaceutical patents and how intellectual property protection may be extended would benefit managed care stakeholders and help inform decisions regarding benefit management.",2016,Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine

Constraints on gene patent protection fuel secrecy concerns: a qualitative study,genetics; innovation; intellectual property; patents; qualitative research; trade secrets; LAW,"Concern is mounting that innovators are responding to recent changes in patent eligibility by increasingly choosing to protect their discoveries as trade secrets. Due to the clandestine nature of trade secrets, it is impossible to quantify the extent to which innovators actually elect to protect their inventions as trade secrets rather than patents. Nevertheless, interest in each strategy may be gauged through qualitative means. We conducted semi-structured interviews of legal and scientific experts (n = 30) to understand the effect of recent patent eligibility changes on interest in patenting and trade secrecy of genetic innovations. Interview data indicate that secrecy may have increased in strategic appeal relative to patent protection in some areas of genetic innovation, although the actual election of secrecy strategies is often limited as a practical matter. The data also suggest that the burden of navigating the new intellectual property landscapemay be falling disproportionately on those who translate gene-based discoveries into clinical applications. Some interviewees expressed concern about the normative implications of secrecy on advancements in and access to genetic medicine. Our findings are potentially relevant to policy proposals intended to restore some of the legal protection that was lost as a result of recent changes to patent eligibility, including amending the federal patent statute and expanding regulatory exclusivities for some genetic technologies.",2017,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a questionnaire survey sent to chief technology officers (or equivalent) of the largest R&D spenders among Swedish large firms (e.g. ABB, AstraZeneca, Ericsson, and Volvo) and among Swedish small and medium-sized enterprises. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regressions were used to check the impact from open innovation upon the importance of 21 different motives to patent, with a specific focus on protection and bargaining related motives. Findings - The most important motive to patent is to protect product technologies, but protecting freedom to operate is almost as important, followed by a number of other motives. Increasing importance of open innovation in firms is related to stronger bargaining motives to patent, and even stronger protection motives. In fact, when comparing with closed innovation, the results show that open innovation is more strongly positively related with all different motives to patent except for one (to attract customers). This indicates that firms find it more important to patent when engaged in open innovation than when engaged in closed innovation. Originality/value - The paper reports results from the first study that links patenting motives to technology strategies. It contributes to an emerging stream of empirical studies investigating the role of patents in external technology strategies and open innovation, showing that the motives to patent are strengthened within open innovation settings.",2017,Business & Economics

The author analyses all drugs on the market between 2005 and 2015, combing through 60,000 data points to examine every instance in which a company added a new patent or exclusivity. The results show a startling departure from the classic conceptualization of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals. Rather than creating new medicines, pharmaceutical companies are largely recycling and repurposing old ones. Specifically, 78% of the drugs associated with new patents were not new drugs, but existing ones, and extending protection is particularly pronounced among blockbuster drugs. Once companies start down the road of extending protection, they show a tendency to return to the well, with the majority adding more than one extension and 50% becoming serial offenders.

Inventions in the field of space engineering continuously constitute significant part of the innovative space market. The protection of intellectual property not only is extremely helpful in cooperation in international and multi-entity projects but also may become a stimulus for further terrestrial and extraterrestrial business opportunities. The variety of space technologies, restricted space market and unique knowledge proved in the space environment, requires special treatment in the context of intellectual protection. The technology transfer process, which consists of extracting and marketing space technologies, services and applications, for a purpose which were not originally intended, requires also a new approach in the context of patent policy.

PATENT BREADTH IN AN INTERNATIONAL SETTING,; PROTECTION,"We examine the Nash equilibria of a game where two national governments set patent breadth strategically. Broader patents make R&D more attractive, but the effect on static efficiency is nonmonotonic. In a North-South model, where only the North can innovate, harmonization of patent breadth lowers welfare relative to the Nash equilibrium. When both countries can innovate, harmonization toward narrower patent breadth may raise world welfare. (JEL F02, F13, O3, O31, O32)",2017,Business & Economics
PATENT LAW AND THE EMIGRATION OF INNOVATION,; PROTECTION; PROPERTY; REACH,"Legislators and industry leaders claim that patent strength in the United States has declined, causing firms to innovate in foreign countries. Because, however, patent law is bound by strict territorial limitations, one cannot strengthen patent protection by innovating abroad; as a result, scholarship has largely dismissed the theory that foreign patents have any effect on where firms invent. In essence, then, there is a debate pitting industry leaders against scholarship about whether firms can use offshore innovation to secure stronger patent rights, influencing the rate of innovation. To resolve this puzzle, we offer a novel theory of patent rights which we empirically test-to dispel the positions taken by both scholarship and industry leaders. Given that technology is generally developed in one country, the innovation process exposes the typical inventor to infringement claims only in that jurisdiction. In turn, we demonstrate that inventors have powerful, counterintuitive incentives to develop technology where patent rights are weaker and enforcement is cheaper. Specifically, it typically costs more to defend a patent infringement claim in the United States than to lose one in another country (the cost to litigate a patent in the United States averages about $3.5 million and royalty awards have surpassed $2.5 billion). Our findings suggest that industry advocates and patent scholars overestimate how much innovation strong patent protection generates while underestimating the deterrent effect of these high costs of patent enforcement. This empirical research contributes to the theoretical understanding of patent rights by shedding new light on this important, yet largely dismissed, dimension of where innovation takes place. We received invaluable support from international research organizations and patent attorneys working for top-tier law firms. Notably, the Global IP Project, a multinational research group spearheaded by Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP, the leading global intellectual property law firm, and Darts-ip, an international organization dedicated to the study of global IP litigation, provided proprietary data. This enabled us to explore whether firms optimize value by placing research and innovation in countries with better patent laws. To verify our models, we interviewed notable patent attorneys practicing in the United States, Europe, and Asia.",2019,Government & Law

In view of changes in the patent law landscape, patent applications are strategically using information on the precise binding sites of their mAbs, i.e., the epitopes, to support patent novelty, non-obviousness, subject matter, and a tightened written description requirement for broad genus antibody claims. Epitope data can also allow freedom-to-operate for second-generation mAbs by differentiation from patented first-generation mAbs. Numerous high profile court cases, including Amgen v. Sanofi over rival mAbs that block PCSK9 activity, have been centered on epitope mapping claims, highlighting the importance of epitopes in determining broad mAb patent rights. Based on these cases, epitope mapping claims must describe a sufficiently large number of mAbs that share an epitope, and each epitope must be described at amino acid resolution. Here, we review current best practices for the use of epitope information to overcome the increasing challenges of patenting mAbs, and how the quality, conformation, and resolution of epitope residue data can influence the breadth and strength of mAb patents.",2018,Research & Experimental Medicine

However, such protections are dependent upon claims that delineate the exclusive rights of the patent. This study examines theoretically and empirically the role of exploitive and explorative search on a firm's patent claims in the biotechnology industry. We argue that firms are subject to 'boundedly rational' behaviors where firms are unable to cite their patent's prior art and therefore are unable to identify with their patent's novel claims. A firm's exploitive and explorative search is offered as a solution to overcoming such bounded rationality. We argue and find that a biotechnology firm's exploitive and explorative search has an inverted u-shaped relationship to a firm's patent claims. A key contribution of this study is that a firm's citation behavior is not only attributed to strategic and legal motivations, but also be to behavioral explanations.",2019,Agriculture
Method Patent Exceptionalism,; POLICY; SCOPE,"Inventive methods and processes have long received hostile treatment by the patent system. Courts have been skeptical of these claims because of the potential for overbreadth of the patent, particularly if the method is delineated in functional terms. This categorical skepticism, however, fails to consider the technological specificity of such concerns. For example, the pharmaceutical industry views method claims, particularly methods of use and treatment, as weaker, second-tier forms of protection. Patents on the chemical compound itself offers greater downstream protection over all uses of the compound. Nevertheless, process claims have received differential treatment in patent law. Congress has adopted process-specific provisions. Notwithstanding that Congress has often legislated specific provisions for process claims, the Federal Circuit has gone further, affording patented processes exceptional and usually detrimental treatment, even though the patent statute is neutral as to the nature of the invention. Moreover, the exceptional treatment creates inconsistencies in the law. For example, the Federal Circuit has stated that it would not be possible to infringe a patent on a method by selling or offering to sell the invention, even though the law is clear that method claims are subject to patent exhaustion (the first sale doctrine) and to the on-sale bar. Similar exceptional treatment arises for the extraterritorial protection for U.S. patents and the manner courts handle divided infringement scenarios, where more than one party is involved in the act of infringement. Ironically, the one area where treating methods differently would be most appropriate assessing patent eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101-is the one place where the Supreme Court has conflated patented methods with other types of inventions.

Redesigning patent management process: an Action Research study,Action Research; Patent management; IPR management; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe how the patent planning and patent evaluation processes might be redesigned for firms intending to move from a mere accumulation of patents to a more thoughtful patent management approach that couples protection with the reduction of cost related to patent file and maintenance. Design/methodology/approach - An Action Research project was carried out in close collaboration with a firm. This approach was adopted since it allows generation of new scientific knowledge from the observation and direct intervention on a specific situation. Findings - Results underline the importance of structuring and formalising the patent planning and patent evaluation processes within the firm. Moreover, it is suggested that the patent planning process should be integrated into the development of a new product/technology since its initial phases. Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to filling the gap regarding the practical implementation and improvement of patent planning and patent evaluation processes, coupling protection with the minimisation of costs related to patent file and maintenance. However, as the results of Action Research studies are specific to the context where they took place, result generalisability is limited. Practical implications - This paper provides managers with a valuable example on how to structure the patent planning and patent evaluation processes. The introduction of specific analyses into these processes allows limiting the decision-making subjectivity and, consequently, enhances the accuracy of firm investment in filing and maintaining its patents. Originality/value - Providing a practical example of the actual implementation and improvement of the patent planning and patent evaluation processes, this paper responds to the recent call for more qualitative studies on intellectual property management.",2017,Business & Economics

The discussion is organized around the major questions in the field. How does openness to trade affect national incentives for patent protection? What is the rationale for international coordination over patent policies? Given that countries are highly asymmetric with respect to their technological capabilities, what incentives do lagging countries have for enforcing IPRs and what are the consequences of requiring them to do so? To what extent do empirical studies support the major arguments for and against the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)? Finally, can the structure of TRIPS-both in terms of the core obligations it imposes on the WTO members and the flexibilities that it provides them with respect to exhaustion policies and the use of compulsory licensing-be reconciled with existing models of IPR protection in the global economy?",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law

Patent implications in the pharmaceutical industry: Are static high prices leading to dynamic innovations?,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PROTECTION; KNOWLEDGE,"Agreement on Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) was laid on the premises of rewarding monopolistic patent rights to the innovator. Stronger patent protection was advocated to promote technology transfer from developed nations to the rest of the world. To boost domestic innovative potential and to maintain trade ties, most developing countries signed the TRIPS agreement. Impact of patent laws in the pharmaceutical industry was crucial as it posed threat to access health. This paper aims to analyze the impact of pharmaceutical product patent laws incorporated under the TRIPS agreement using 65 countries panel dataset from 1995 to 2016. The data is empirically analyzed using negative binomial regression and Poisson regression. Results clearly indicate that the number of pharmaceutical patents filed in US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has decreased after TRIPS compliance in both low and middle income countries. However, the decline is larger in upper middle and lower middle income countries than in low income countries. The phenomenon of low patent activity has an increasingly declining trend across low and middle income countries. Hence the claimed hypothesis that stronger patent rights would increase innovative potential does not seem to stand true, which raises serious affordability concerns of bringing patents in the pharmaceutical sector.",2019,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; General & Internal Medicine"
"Patent Protection, Startup Takeovers, and Open Innovation",Open Innovation; Startup Takeovers; Patent Portfolios; LITIGATION; PERFORMANCE; SETTLEMENT; MARKET,"Open innovation largely relies on startup innovators transferring their R&D to incumbent firms. Yet, such innovators are at a disadvantage when faced with incumbents holding patent portfolios, raising the question why do such Lilliputian firms choose to innovate? In view of this, we study the impact of patent protection on the innovation incentives of startup firms in a dynamic model where an incumbent faces a sequence of potential startups and the incumbent's chance of winning an infringement lawsuit increases with the size of its patent portfolio. It is shown that open innovation-style takeover deals generate extra benefits for the incumbent via its enhanced future bargaining positions, a part of which accrues to the current startup as an increased bargaining share, justifying R&D activity that would not have taken place otherwise.",2019,Business & Economics

We find that 55% of triadic patents are commercialized. We also find that 17% of all triadic patents are not commercialized but are at least partially for preemption, though only 3% of all triadic patents are purely preemptive patents. We find that preemptive non-use is less common than failed patents. We then test the discriminating effects of patent effectiveness, competition, firm size and fragmentation of patent rights on the likelihood of preemptive patents. We find that greater patent effectiveness, more competition, and large firm size are associated with greater preemptive non-use relative to commercial use of patents. We conclude with the policy implications of our results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2016,Business & Economics
Do innovative firms rely on big secrets? An analysis of IP protection strategies with the CIS 4 survey,intellectual property; innovation; secrecy; patenting; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PATENTS; INFORMATION; COMPETITION; LITIGATION; DISCLOSURE; OLIGOPOLY,"Innovative companies have a variety of instruments at their disposal to protect themselves from imitators, and this paper investigates the determinants of the protection choices with a focus on highly innovative respondents. While the patent system's aim is that firms apply to patent their innovations, especially the most important ones, theoretical results in the existing literature suggest that large innovations will rather be protected by secrecy because of the legal uncertainty surrounding intellectual property rights. In line with the predictions of their model, our probit analysis conducted using data from the Community Innovation Survey 4 shows that, in the intermediate goods industry, small innovations are patented while secrecy is used to protect large ones. For very innovative small firms, the share of innovative sales in total sales has a negative effect on patent application. These findings support the view that many innovative firms regard patent filing as no more secure than secrecy, which therefore limits the diffusion of knowledge.",2016,Business & Economics

It first discusses the motive behind his opposition of extension of Richard Champion's patent and then delves into his defence of his own patent in the dispute with the alleged infringer. It aims to show the incongruence of words and deeds of a tradesman with respect to patents; more importantly, it sets out to demonstrate that the claim of patent as an incentivising measure does not bear out as far as Wedgwood is concerned; rather, it is lack of patent protection that facilitates innovation in his pottery business.",2018,History; Government & Law

What can explain the Chinese patent explosion?,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTERNAL FINANCE; INNOVATION; FIRMS; PROTECTION; COUNTRIES; CAPACITY; MATTER; SURGE; UK,"We analyse the 'explosion' of patent filings by Chinese residents, both domestically and in the USA during the early 2000s, employing a unique data set of 374,000 firms matching patent applications to manufacturing census data. Our analysis reveals that patenting is highly concentrated among a small number of firms, operating in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. Although increases in patent filings by these companies are partly driven by increased R& D intensity, our analysis suggests that the explosion of patent filings at the Chinese patent office is driven by factors other than underlying innovative behaviour, including government subsidies that encourage patent filings directly.",2017,Business & Economics

Using administrative data on successful and unsuccessful patent applications submitted to the US Patent and Trademark Office, we link the exact gene sequences claimed in each application with data measuring follow-on scientific research and commercial investments. Using these data, we document novel evidence of selection into patenting: patented genes appear more valuable-prior to being patented-than non-patented genes. This evidence of selection motivates two quasi-experimental approaches, both of which suggest that on average gene patents have had no quantitatively important effect on follow-on innovation.",2019,Business & Economics
Patenting Decisions by South African Biotechnology Entrepreneurs,; ,"I present and analyze the results of a surveybroadly along the lines of the 2008 Berkeley Patent Survey (a survey of patenting among U.S. high-tech entrepreneurs)conducted among South African biotechnology entrepreneurs. All 41 companies that qualified as part of the target population participated in the online survey. The results show that almost 60% (24) of South African entrepreneurial biotechnology companies sought patent protection for their innovations; 79% (19/24) of South African entrepreneurial biotechnology companies that have sought patent protection did so internationally, with the greater portions of these companies patenting in five to ten, or more than ten, major countries in the world. The responses by the South African entrepreneurial biotechnology companies support the main findings made by Graham et al. (that analyzed the 2008 Berkeley Patent Survey) regarding U.S. high-tech entrepreneurs: in brief, that patenting is one of multiple elements that can be part of a biotechnology entrepreneur's appropriation strategy, and that the decision whether to utilize patenting as part of an appropriation strategy is informed by various combinations of reasons that are not limited by the traditional legal rationales for patenting, but also include purely strategic rationales. There are, within the broad parameters of these main findings, also significant differences between South African biotechnology entrepreneurs and their U.S. counterparts, such as the relative importance of patenting as an element of a company's appropriation strategy, and the frequency of cost considerations as reason for forgoing patenting.",2016,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

In this paper, we argue that such institution-seeking behavior may not be confined to the pursuit of strong institutions: firms may also seek weak institutions to mitigate hazards. Using panel data from the global smartphone industry and recent patent wars among key industry rivals, we examine how smartphone vendors that are not directly involved in patent litigation strategically respond to increased litigation risks in this industry. We find that as patent wars intensify, smartphone vendors not involved in any litigation focus more of their business in markets with weaker intellectual property (IP) protection because of institutional arbitrage opportunities. This strategic response is more pronounced for vendors whose stocks of patents are small and whose home markets have weak-IP systems. Our study is the first to examine the relationship between heterogeneity in national patent systems and firms' global strategies. It provides a more balanced view of firms' institution-seeking behavior by documenting how they make strategic use of weaker institutions.",2016,Business & Economics

Consequently, this study argues for an improvement of women's access to medicines within the context of patent law and rights, the available flexibilities in the international IP regime of the Trade Related Aspect of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and Nigeria's national patent system. Towards this goal, the article makes the point that patent law and its exclusive rights, both the TRIPS Agreement and national law of Nigeria, do not exist in a social welfare vacuum. The legal text of patent law, which confers rights on inventors when enforced, translates to many other things outside the sphere of property rights; indeed, it can be a matter of life and death. It is argued in this regard that patent right could, in effect, interfere with access to medicines and therefore, the right to health and prospects for human development. This study adopts a doctrinal methodology to examine, analyse, and evaluate the issues that have arisen in the context of patent protection of pharmaceuticals and its effect on access medicines. It concludes that while the hindrances to accessibility of essential drugs in Nigeria are multifaceted and demand a multidimensional approach for a lasting solution, the TRIPS flexibilities are significant means for addressing the challenges of affordable access to important health treatments within the context of patent law. However, it is emphasised that utilising the flexibilities will require that Nigeria's patent system is strategically designed to take full advantage of the available exceptions, safeguards, and options.",2019,Government & Law
Who Cares About Patents? Cross-Industry Differences in the Marginal Value of Patent Term,; INNOVATION; RENEWAL,"How much do market participants in different industries value a marginal change in patent term (i.e., duration of patent protection)? We explore this research question by measuring the behavioral response of patentees to a rare natural experiment: a change in patent term rules, due to passage of the TRIPS agreement. We find significant heterogeneity in patentee behavior across industries, some of which follows conventional wisdom (patent term is important in pharmaceuticals) and some of which does not (it also appears to matter for some software). Our measure is highly correlated with patent renewal rates across industries, suggesting the marginal value of patent term increases with higher expected profits toward the end of term.",2019,Business & Economics; Government & Law

Even the non-pharmaceutical sector saw an increase in the number of various patent disputes. India, while enacting its three amendments, had tried to leverage the flexibility provided by the TRIPS Agreement to its member states, and to a great extent these amendments have resulted in an increase in patent-related disputes.

Does stronger patent protection increase export variety? Evidence from US product-level data,intellectual property; international property law; international regulations; trade flows; multiple regression analysis; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION,"Proponents of global intellectual property rights (IPRs) reforms have argued that developing countries' weak IPRs limit their access to foreign innovative products and technologies. Central to our understanding of the effects of IPRs on product access is the influence of national differences in patent protection on corporate behavior and business strategy of multinational firms. Using detailed product data on US exports from 1990 to 2000, this research note assesses the impact of strengthening IPRs in developing countries on product variety of US exports. Colonial origin and cross-industry variation in patent effectiveness serve to identify the impact. The results show that the strengthening of IPRs increased exports of new products in patent-sensitive industries. The expansion in product variety accounted for the entire increase in US exports. The findings substantiate claims that ratification of TRIPS by developing countries promotes access to new foreign products and technologies. Additionally, the results demonstrate that patent protection is a significant institutional factor in US firms' business decisions over the introduction of new products and processes into a developing country marketplace.",2015,Business & Economics
Process Patent Protection via Analysis of Stable Isotope Ratios,; CARBON; FRACTIONATION; AUTHENTICITY; DELTA-C-13; HYDROGEN; ACIDS,"Process patent protection via the analysis of natural-abundance stable isotopes has been demonstrated as an approach to extend the effective life of bio/pharmaceutical patents. The high specificity of isotope ratio analysis compared to other approaches (for example, concentrations of organic impurities or trace metals) allows the isotopic analysis to differentiate processes that were not previously resolvable by less precise analytical methods. Here we summarize the rationale for, and some selected case studies of, this emerging field. We review: (i) the systematics of stable isotope chemistry, (ii) approaches to instrumental analysis of stable isotopes, (iii) the biogeochemical origin of stable isotopic fingerprints, (iv) equilibrium versus kinetic isotope effects on those fingerprints, (v) categories of application of process patent protection, and (vi) case histories of application. The three reviewed cases include one of nutraceutical false advertising, one of a small molecule antibiotic drug product infringement, and one of wrongful accusation of human drug product infringement, which protected these bio/pharmaceutical products against patent infringement. Finally, we briefly preview some new applications of stable isotopic analysis in the bio/pharmaceutical field including analysis of biologic drugs, continuous monitoring of drug reaction processes, and isotopically directed synthesis.",2017,Chemistry

The Current Dilemma and Future of Software Patenting,Software patent; Computer program; Alice v. CLS; Abstract idea; Innovation; EUROPE,"The unprecedented division over patent eligibility based on the abstract idea construct among the courts and judges in the Alice v. CLS case, the post-Alice contradictory decisions and the trend of rejecting or invalidating software patents, as well as the uncertainty about the concept of computer program as such (or per se) in Europe and China, present a chaotic reality and serious dilemma as to the future direction of the software patenting regime around the world. The recent revisions to patent examination guidelines by the patent offices in the US, Europe and China, particularly the grouping of abstract ideas by the USPTO, providing examples of a further technical effect by the EPO, and distinguishing a computer program per se and computer-implemented inventions by the CNIPA, although helpful in patent examinations, cannot solve the root problem and fix the dilemma. A more general definition, or a safe harbour, for the abstract idea or computer program as such is needed. In addition, to prevent patent trolls and promote true software innovation, the scope and length of software patent protection should be limited, e.g. allowing only the means of implementation but not the function to be patented; and granting 10 years of utility-model-type or sui generis protection. All the above proposed reforms should be undertaken at the international level, e.g. by adopting a Software Treaty under the auspices of the WIPO, because the software patent dilemma is a global one that deserves an international solution, especially in the age of the internet where most of the software patents cover borderless internet technologies.",2019,Government & Law
The development of ecosystems for technology transfer in Mexico: the role of Patenting Centers,Patenting Centers; intellectual property; public research centers; technology transfer; ,"In this article, we evaluate an initiative recently launched by the national government in Mexico to create 'Patenting Centers' in various universities and research institutions in diverse regions of the country. We focus particularly on elucidating how the installation of these Patenting Centers has augmented the number of national filings for intellectual property (IP) protection, and how the Centers have contributed to increasing the quality of IP applications. Furthermore, we analyze how the Mexican Patenting Centers have qualitatively contributed to fostering local cultures of innovation, for example through capacity-building activities directed towards scientific researchers. We also attempt to understand how the Patenting Centers have supported processes of technology transfer and commercialization, which we evaluate by examining a case study from the Northwest Biological Research Center (CIBNOR). Our findings indicate that the Mexican Patenting Centers have contributed to increasing IP protection activity in various regions of the country, and that they have augmented interactions between public research institutions and the productive sector. We conclude with suggestions for how the Patenting Center model may be further assessed in the future, to ensure that the government's mission of fostering endogenous innovation and the creation of a knowledge-based economy may continue to be realized.",2018,Government & Law

In a simple model, we identify forces that lead firms to either suboptimally patent too early or too late in equilibrium, and we determine conditions so that stronger patents induce earlier or later equilibrium disclosure. Then, by solving an infinite multistage patent game with a more explicit structure, we describe innovation growth, and derive detailed predictions that can be used for policy experiments. As an application, we calibrate our multistage game using summary statistics from the seeds breeding industry. We find that weaker patent rights may result in welfare gains of 46% relative to the status quo. The gains are achieved because weaker patents reduce competition, thus leading firms to postpone patenting.",2016,Business & Economics

We consider lean innovation patenting strategies in an emerging market context that is undergoing improvement in its intellectual property protection (IPP) regime. Grounded in upper echelons theory we expect that the initiation of an intra-family succession will lead to generational shift in a FFs approach to IPP, as evinced in its patenting strategy. Applying a difference in difference methodology we are able to compare FFs who have undertaken an intra-family succession with FFs who have not yet initiated a succession process. Further, we consider the second difference as a strategy change between the pre- and post-succession period thereby isolating the effects of the post-succession change on patenting strategy. We also distinguish between different patent types (invention, utility, and design), and consider FF propensity to patent, and patent conversion rates. Based on generational differences between founders and successors we find successors are significant adopters of lean innovation patenting strategies. We add to the sparse literature on succession in emerging market FFs and contribute to improved understandings of long-term FF strategic adaptation in a dynamic institutional landscape.",2019,Business & Economics

In this paper, we investigate the effects of regional and temporal variation in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws on firms' innovative activities. We find that bankruptcy laws that provide stronger debtor protection decrease the number of patents produced by small firms. Stronger debtor protection also decreases the average quality, and variance in quality, of firms' patents. We find evidence that the negative effect of stronger debtor protection on experimentation and innovation may be due to the decreased availability of external financing in response to stronger debtor rights, an effect amplified in industries with a high dependence on external financing. Hence, while it is typically assumed that stronger debtor protection encourages innovation by reducing the cost of failure for innovators, we show that it can instead dampen innovative activities by tightening the availability of external financing to innovative firms.",2017,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
Protection of Phage Applications in Crop Production: A Patent Landscape,phage biocontrol; patent landscape; crop production; RESISTANCE; BACTERIA; THREAT,"In agriculture, the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections represents an increasing challenge. Traditional (chemical) methods have been restricted to ensure public health and to limit the occurrence of resistant strains. Bacteriophages could be a sustainable alternative. A major hurdle towards the commercial implementation of phage-based biocontrol strategies concerns aspects of regulation and intellectual property protection. Within this study, two datasets have been composed to analyze both scientific publications and patent documents and to get an idea on the focus of research and development (R&D) by means of an abstract and claim analysis. A total of 137 papers and 49 patent families were found from searching public databases, with their numbers increasing over time. Within this dataset, the majority of the patent documents were filed by non-profit organizations in Asia. There seems to be a good correlation between the papers and patent documents in terms of targeted bacterial genera. Furthermore, granted patents seem to claim rather broad and cover methods of treatment. This review shows that there is indeed growing publishing and patenting activity concerning phage biocontrol. Targeted research is needed to further stimulate the exploration of phages within integrated pest management strategies and to deal with bacterial infections in crop production.",2019,Virology
"Sequential Product Innovation, Competition and Patent Policy",Sequential innovation; Patent policy; Entry; INDUSTRY; RETURN; RISK; LIFE,This paper examines the role of patent policy in a spatial model of sequential innovation. Initial entrepreneurs develop a new product market and anticipate that subsequent innovation may lead to a product line that consumers value more highly. The likelihood of sequential innovation increases with the number of initial early entrants in the market. Patent protection that encourages early entry can therefore raise the probability of both initial and subsequent innovation.

Understanding Patent Privateering: A Quantitative Assessment,; ,"Since 2011, several papers and articles have speculated about the motivations, activities, and possible anti-competitive effects of hybrid patent assertion entities (PAEs) or, more pejoratively, patent privateers. Most prior work has assumed that privateers are essentially extorting money from firms by making weak infringement claims employing weak patents. Under a more classical law and economics approach, we would expect patent privateers to acquire valuable patents to reduce litigation risk and justify patent enforcement. However, to date, there has been no quantitative analysis on this form of patent holder to support or disprove either of these theoretical viewpoints. This article takes a first step toward filling that gap in the analysis by conducting an empirical assessment of patent lawsuits filed between 2010 and 2013. Although several studies have provided useful analysis on who litigates patents and which patents are more likely to be litigated, we add new variables and insights to the analysis. First, our dataset identifies the business models of the parties involved, including hybrid PAEs. Second, we include data on patent reassignments, which allows us to identify when a hybrid PAE takes (partial) possession of a patent. Third, for making comparisons between litigated and unlitigated patents, our dataset includes a set of unlitigated patents that match our litigated patent dataset on several key variables. In this work, we explore three interesting questions: (1) What patent characteristics predict a patent's acquisition by a hybrid PAE? (2) Do hybrid PAEs acquire patents that are more likely to be litigated? and (3) Does reassignment to a hybrid PAE affect the time when a patent is first asserted in litigation? We find that hybrid PAEs tend to acquire patents in the information technology, surgery, and medical instrument fields more often than patents in other technology areas. Hybrid PAEs also obtain relatively higher-quality patents than average, but objective quality metrics generally are on par when compared to patents litigated by firms with other business models. Our analysis also suggests that hybrid PAEs prefer patents with a broader scope of protection. Reassigning a patent to a hybrid PAE is generally associated with higher odds that the patents will be litigated. Finally, patents held by hybrid PAEs at some point in their lifespan experience their first litigation later than those never held by a hybrid PAE. In short, our analysis suggests that patent privateers appear to be focused on improving the possibility of successful patent monetization by focusing on acquiring higher-quality patents with a broader scope of protection, as value and scope are perceived by economists. This research is consistent with the law and economics theory that hybrid PAEs acquire valuable patents and not the extortion theory that they acquire weak patents.",2019,Government & Law
Patents and Cumulative Innovation: Causal Evidence from the Courts,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; CHILD PROTECTION; POLICY; MARKET; TECHNOLOGY; ASSIGNMENT; STRATEGIES; IMPACT,"Cumulative innovation is central to economic growth. Do patent rights facilitate or impede follow-on innovation? We study the causal effect of removing patent rights by court invalidation on subsequent research related to the focal patent, as measured by later citations. We exploit random allocation of judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to control for endogeneity of patent invalidation. Patent invalidation leads to a 50% increase in citations to the focal patent, on average, but the impact is heterogeneous and depends on characteristics of the bargaining environment. Patent rights block downstream innovation in computers, electronics, and medical instruments, but not in drugs, chemicals, or mechanical technologies. Moreover, the effect is entirely driven by invalidation of patents owned by large patentees that triggers more follow-on innovation by small firms.

"EXPIRED PATENTS, TRADE SECRETS, AND STYMIED COMPETITION",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; DISCLOSURE; MARKET; RIGHTS; DELAY; LAW,"Patents and trade secrecy have long been considered substitute incentives for innovation. When inventors create a new invention, they traditionally must choose between the two. And if inventors choose to patent their invention, society provides strong legal protection in exchange for disclosure, with the understanding that the protection has a limit: it expires twenty years from the date of filing. At that time, the invention is opened to the public and exposed to competition. This story is incomplete. Patent disclosure is weak and focuses on one technical piece of an invention but that piece is often only a part of the market-relevant innovation. Patent-holding innovators use various tactics to distort the patent bargain and prolong effective monopolies beyond the patent's expiration date. These tactics include using patented inventions to generate secret information, relying on the timing difference between patent filing and product marketing to make disclosure nearly irrelevant, and tying secret components to patented frameworks. While these phenomena have been noted before, this Article joins them together as examples of ways that innovators avoid the competition-promoting function of patent expiration, ultimately limiting the benefit the public receives from patented inventions. It also suggests that the most problematic cases likely involve markets where additional factors, such as regulation or other market irregularities, require that goods be interchangeable. Finally, it proposes the concept of economic enablement: patentees may have a responsibility to enable not just the bare technical invention disclosed in a patent, but rather the minimum information necessary to exploit commercially the patented invention. Against the background of the newly enacted Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act, courts and scholars alike should examine the boundaries between trade secrets and patents to ensure that the overlap does not distort the policy goal of incentivizing and promoting both innovation and competition.",2017,Government & Law

Indeed, existing literature does not provide a punctual estimate of this effect for developing countries. This paper fills this gap, by exploiting a self-constructed dataset which provides, for a 22-year period, information concerning IPR reforms involving pharmaceuticals for 74 developed and developing countries. The identification strategy exploits the different timing across these countries of two sets of IPR reforms. Domestic innovation is measured as citation-weighted domestic patent applications filed at the European Patent Office (EPO): the highly skewed distribution of the dependent variable, and the high number of zero observations, are taken into account using count data models. In particular, a Zero Inflated Negative Binomial model is adopted, to overcome previous literature assumption that all innovations are patented in the main markets of reference, and to take into consideration the choice not to patent at the EPO. Results show that innovation is sensitive to IPR protection, but not to its degree. Moreover, the effect is not long lasting. My study also finds that developing countries profit significantly less than developed ones from the protection, benefiting from an effect that is roughly half of that for developed countries. Consequent policy implications are examined, and include the conclusions that a one size fits all approach can be inappropriate, and that gradual reforms should be preferred to rare reforms that greatly alter the level of IPR protection.

Patent rights protection and foreign direct investment in Asian countries,PRs protection; FDI; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; DETERMINANTS; TRADE; FDI; EXPORTS,"Patent rights (PRs) protection has acquired an important role in the new knowledge-based global economy, and it has been an essential policy issue for a number of years. Many previous papers have examined how PRs protection affects international trade, but there is lack of study on the relationship between PRs protection and foreign direct investment (FDI). According to the active FDI activities in Asia, this paper conducts a research from 1985 to 2010 to completely investigate the relationship between PRs protection and inward FDI in eleven main Asian countries by adopting Ordinary. Least Square (OLS) and System Generalized Method of Moments (System GMM). The empirical results indicate that strengthening PRs protection in host countries can increase Asian countries' FDI inflows. Moreover, different country characteristics might make distinctive influences on inward FDI. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015,Business & Economics

In a PBR regime, a monopolist might let farmers self-produce, and he over-or under-invests compared to socially optimal investments. Under a PBR and patent regime, large (small) innovations are more likely to be patented (protected with PBRs), but self-production is not completely prevented, private investments are often socially optimal, and incentives to innovate are boosted.

Inventors were generally supportive of legislation that made patenting more accessible, while others, especially manufacturers, saw patenting culture as an impediment. The medical profession claimed that patenting represented 'a barrier to medical treatment' and was thus detrimental to the nation's health, yet, as I argue, the profession's development of strict codes of conduct forbidding practitioners from patenting resulted in rebellion from some members, who increasingly sought protection for their inventions. Such polarized opinions within the medical trade continue to affect current medical practice today.",2016,History & Philosophy of Science
PATENTING OR SECRET? THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LEADING FIRMS AND FOLLOWING FIRMS BASED ON EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY AND MULTI-AGENT SIMULATION,Appropriability; patents; secret; imitation; substitution; SUBSTITUTION; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION,"Firms who want to appropriate innovation often need to make decision facing the trade-off between patenting and secret. This paper explores how leading firms make trade-off between patenting and secret through the view of the interaction between leading firms and following firms who have the option of imitation or substitution, based on the evolutionary game theory. Then, a simulation model is built combining the evolutionary game model and agent-based modelling method, which allows us to implement bounded rationality and interactivities. The simulation is run with different gain parameters and the results are checked by cross-validation. It is found that leading firms are more likely to adopt patenting strategy with well developed patent protection regime. While depending on variations on patent protection effectiveness, technological characteristics, and leading firms' investment in patent portfolio development, following firms may choose imitation strategy or substitution strategy. Considering bounded rationality, firms could choose sub-optional strategies and leads to scenarios other than evolutionary equilibrium solutions, which provide deeper insights of strategic choices of leading firms and following firms. This paper makes contributions to theory by using the perspective of multi-agent view and integrating bounded rationality in the simulation. Finally, this paper draws conclusion and puts forward some suggestions.",2019,Business & Economics

Drug development for cryptococcosis treatment: what can patents tell us?,cryptococcosis; Cryptococcus; cryptococcal meningitis; patent landscape; DISCOVERY; DISEASE; SURVEILLANCE; MENINGITIS,"BACKGROUND Cryptococcosis is one of the most devastating fungal infections in humans. Despite the disease's clinical importance, current therapy is based on limited antifungals that are either toxic, inefficient, unavailable worldwide, or that quickly lead to resistance. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to provide insight into the future of cryptococcosis treatment by describing the patent scenario in this field. METHODS We identified and analysed patent documents revealing compounds with anti-cryptococcal activity supported by experimental evidence. FINDINGS Patenting in this field has been historically low, with an overall tendency of increase since 2012. Most applications are single filings, suggesting that they do not encompass strategic inventions requiring broad protection. Research and development essentially took place in China and the United States, which also represent the main countries of protection. Both academic and corporate institutions contributed to patenting in this field. Universities are the leading actors, with the highest patent family counts. CONCLUSION The low number of patents in this field indicates that efforts to mitigate the unmet needs for cryptococcosis treatment remain insufficient. Without investment to drive research and innovation, patients will likely continue to face inadequate assistance. Given the current scenario characterised by poor funding and low interest for technological development, drug repurposing may be the best alternative for cryptococcosis treatment.",2019,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine

After the 20-year patent protection period elapses, society should be able to make free use of the publicly available knowledge described in the patent document, which is deemed useful. Resistance to pesticides destroys however the usefulness of information listed in patent documents over time. The invention, here pesticides, will have a decreased effectiveness once it enters the public domain. In some cases pesticides lose most of their efficacy shortly after temporary exclusive rights expire. Society's share of the patent bargain-having new useful knowledge available in the public domain-is lost. Resistance can be slowed down, if pesticide use is limited by optimal compliance. Stimulating proper use is generally not compatible with existing market incentives for patent holders, since these have to be able to maximize profits in order to recoup research and development costs and satisfy obligations to the company's stakeholders. Another incentive system is needed to ensure longevity of pesticides, which at the same time does not hamper future research.",2015,Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; History & Philosophy of Science

Two decades ago, a new global standard of intellectual property swept across developing and industrialized nations through the implementation of the WTO's TRIPS Agreement. Many years later, the issue of patent rights remains contentious. In this paper, we focus on the effects of patent rights systems on total factor productivity growth, using dynamic panel regression analysis for 70 countries from 1965 to 2009. We show that the effects of stronger or more rigorous patent systems are insignificant for productivity growth in both developing and industrialized countries. Why does the strength of patents appear to have no impact on productivity? Classic economic theory suggests that stronger patent systems incentive innovative output with important spill-over effects for productivity and growth. We offer an alternative explanation using data from the Economic Complexity Index. We find that while patents rights are increasingly irrelevant to productivity, the relationship between economic complexity and productivity is highly positive and significant. Our results are consistent with the contributions of the absorptive capacity theory in that they suggest it is not the discovery and ownership of novel products and processes at the innovative frontier that induces productive growth, but the ability to adapt, replicate and diffuse along the international productive chain.

Depending on investment, patent quantity significantly improves the size of VC investment and firm valuation. This effect is pronounced in first-round investment, strong intellectual property protection regions, during periods of loose monetary policy, and state/corporate VC.

By examining U.S. state-level legal adoption of a doctrine allowing employers to curtail inventor mobility if the employee would inevitably disclose trade secrets, we investigate the impact of a shifting trade secrecy regime on individual-level patenting outcomes. Using a difference-in-differences design taking unaffected U.S. inventors as the comparison group, we find strengthening employer-friendly trade secrecy adversely affects innovation. We then investigate why. We do not find empirical support for diminished idea recombination from suppressed inventor mobility as the operative mechanism. While shifting intellectual property protection away from patenting into trade secrecy has some explanatory power, our results are consistent with reduced individual-level incentives to signaling quality to the external labor market.Managerial Summary: While managers often list trade secrecy protection as their most important appropriation mechanism form and basis of competitive advantage (even more often than formal intellectual property protection), researchers have a hard time studying the effect of such secrets. We use a changing trade secrecy legal environment in some U.S. states (the introduction of the inevitable disclosure doctrine [IDD]) to study its effect on inventor-level innovation. We find that a strengthened employer-friendly trade secrecy regime adversely affects inventor-level innovation. While part of the effect is due to substituting trade secrecy protection for patents, we also find that inventors' diminished external labor market prospects may dampen their innovation output. Consequently, while employers may wish for strengthened trade secrecy protections, the results may paradoxically be against their innovation interests.",2018,Business & Economics

After the incumbent has acquired a patent, it can be infringed by the challenger, and the conflict between them can be resolved via litigation or settlement with endogenously determined triggers and royalties. The model explains why litigation is so unusual in the real world and why most of the lawsuits over patent rights cease before the court's judgment is made. It also clarifies why roughly a half of litigated patents are found to be invalid in court and in what circumstances the introduction of new technology or the infringement of patent is delayed. From the perspective of implications on patent system, the model shows that neither tightening the patent examination nor widening the patent scope guarantees the acceleration of R&D investment, and rather delays it in some cases.

We find that post-AIPA U.S. patent applications are significantly more likely to be licensed before patent grant and shortly after 18-month publication. Licensing delays are reduced by about 10 months, on average, after AIPA's enactment. These findings suggest a hitherto unexplored benefit of the patent system: by requiring inventions to be published through a credible, standardized, and centralized repository, it mitigates information costs for buyers and sellers, and thus facilitates transactions in the market for ideas.",2018,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science

The design features were analysed in relation to the consumer rights and guarantees described in the terms of use agreements of the patent assignees. The analysis revealed that some in-game purchasing systems could be characterized as unfair or exploitative. These systems describe tactics that capitalize on informational advantages (e.g., behavioral tracking) and data manipulation (e.g., price manipulation) to optimize offers to incentivize continuous spending, while offering limited or no guarantees or protections (e.g., refund entitlement), with the potential to exploit vulnerable players (e.g., adolescents, problematic garners).

Patents serve the social interest if they provide not just invention, but innovation the world would not otherwise have. Non-practicing entities (NPEs) as well as product-producing companies can sometimes provide such innovation, either directly, through working the patent or transferring technology to others who do, or indirectly, when others copy the patented innovation. The available evidence suggests, however, that patent licensing demands and lawsuits from NPEs are normally not cases that involve any of these activities. Some scholars have argued that patents can be valuable even without technology transfer because the ability to exclude others from the market may drive commercialization that would not otherwise occur.

WAYS OUT OF THE PATENTING PROHIBITION?

This article is based on the thesis that in light of the technological advances in the field of stem cell research, the attribution of the term ` human embryo' to certain entities on a descriptive level as well as the attribution of a normative protection status to certain entities based on the criterion of totipotency, are becoming increasingly unclear. The example of human parthenotes in particular demonstrates that totipotency is not at all a necessary condition for the attribution of the term ` human embryo'. Furthermore, the example of hiPSC and somatic cells particularly shows that totipotency is also not a sufficient condition for the attribution of a normative protection status to certain entities. Therefore, it is not a suitable criterion for distinguishing between human embryos worthy of protection and human non-embryos not worthy of protection. Consequently, this conclusion has repercussions for the patenting question. The strict delineation between an ethically problematic commercial use of human embryos and the concomitant patenting prohibition of hESC-based procedures and an ethically unproblematic commercial use of human non-embryos and the therefore either unrestrictedly permitted (cf. human parthenotes) or even unregulated (cf. hiPSC) patenting of procedures based on these alleged alternatives becomes increasingly blurred.",2017,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences

The impact of product piracy on corporate IP strategy,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PROPENSITY SCORE; SOFTWARE PIRACY; SMALL FIRMS; PATENT; PROTECTION; INNOVATIONS; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION,"We analyze how cases of unauthorized reproduction of a company's technology (product piracy') influence the subsequent intellectual property (IP) protection strategy of around 200 German manufacturing companies. Specifically, we examine whether product piracy induces a stronger use of formal IP strategies or whether a shift to informal protection mechanisms occurs. Using propensity score matching, we compare companies with similar characteristics (e.g. prior IP strategy, business activities, industry affiliation, etc.). We find that imitation incidences induce a stronger use of formal protection rights, whereas for informal protection, we detect no significant differences between the copied companies and the control group. We are able to further distinguish this effect according to firm size and detect that it especially plays out for large firms. These insights raise the question whether large companies should reconsider their further focus on filing additional patents and take the strengths of the alternative protection mechanisms stronger into account. For small firms, our findings raise the concern of a restriction in scope of potential strategic response toward product piracy. On a policy level, the general and further pushed disadvantage for small- and medium-sized companies in the patent system generally calls for a policy initiative, which addresses this problem by addressing their resource constraints.",2016,Business & Economics

This Article calls such divergences between parties' initial motivations to obtain patents and those patents' predominant uses later on patent schisms. Because traditional patent law theories typically treat the purposes of patents as static, scholars have neglected to explicitly examine patent schisms and the reasons behind them. This is so despite the pervasiveness of patent schisms in a variety of important contexts. Those contexts include the patenting behaviors of early-stage companies, later-stage companies, so-called patent trolls, and universities. In fact, patent schisms lie at the heart of some of the most controversial patent law topics, including whether patents should be considered a form of personal property or, instead, as a regulatory right. This Article examines patent schisms and adds to the patent literature in three principal ways. First, it provides an account of the ubiquity of patent schisms in a variety of important settings. Second, it articulates three theories explaining how and why patent schisms arise. These hypotheses include the proposition that patenting an invention often creates economic and psychological incentives to ultimately use that patent in defiance of a party's original motivation to obtain the patent. Finally, the Article examines the normative and theoretical implications of the pervasiveness of patent schisms and the explanations behind them. These include briefly assessing whether treating patents as a form of personal property is the correct approach to ensuring that the patent system serves its constitutional purpose of promoting the progress of science and the useful arts.",2018,Government & Law

Strengthening patent rights lowers appropriability hazards and so reduces the firms' reliance on affiliated licensing as the more secure means of transfer (the internalization effect). However lower appropriability hazards also encourage the firms to increase the volume of technology transfer via licensing both within and outside the firm (the appropriability effect). Which effect prevails depends on the underlying technological complexity of the firms' product. We find that a strengthening of patent protection in the host country increases the incentive to license innovations to unaffiliated parties. While unaffiliated licensing rises among all firms, the volume of affiliated licensing falls among complex-technology firms but rises among simple-technology firms. The positive appropriability effect on affiliated licensing is strong enough among simple-technology firms that the entire composition of their licensing further shifts towards affiliated parties. The results are significant for recent work on the internalization theories of multinational firms and the interaction between firm strategy and the institutional environment, as well as for patent policy in the developing world, where access to knowledge is critical.",2017,Business & Economics

The Market Impacts of Pharmaceutical Product Patents in Developing Countries: Evidence from India,; POLITICAL PRESSURE; INNOVATION; PRICES; ENTRY; LAWS; PROTECTION; INDUSTRY; THREAT; FIRM,"In 2005, as the result of a World Trade Organization mandate, India implemented a patent reform for pharmaceuticals that was intended to comply with the 1995 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Exploiting variation in the timing of patent decisions, we estimate that a molecule receiving a patent experienced an average price increase of just 3-6 percent, with larger increases for more recently developed molecules and for those produced by just one firm when the patent system began. Our results also show little impact on quantities sold or on the number of pharmaceutical firms operating in the market.",2016,Business & Economics

Therefore, this paper aims to fill a gap in the literature on knowledge management, based on an analysis of the development and implementation of Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC). This paper examines the processes of developing a standard for classifying patent applications from the perspective of Actor-Network Theory ( ANT). Our findings reveal that standardization in the context of patent classification is primarily shaped by the interaction involving patent offices that belong to the IP5 group. Furthermore, we found evidence that the CPC standard can be regarded as a response to the demands posed by innovative firms requiring accurate patent classification to provide secure protection for their new technologies.

We find that when the number of firms is fixed in the short run, patent breadth and R&D subsidies serve to increase economic growth as in previous studies. However, when market structure adjusts endogenously in the long run, R&D subsidies increase economic growth but decrease the number of firms, whereas patent breadth expands the number of firms but reduces economic growth. Therefore, in accordance with empirical evidence, R&D subsidy is perhaps a more suitable policy instrument than patent breadth for the purpose of stimulating long-run economic growth.",2016,Business & Economics

While recent studies provide a negative relationship between IPR protection and technological innovation, this paper argues that firm's internationalization weaken the negative relationship. This research is a meaningful step to clarify the theoretical conflict and empirical ambiguity of the effect of IPR protection on technological innovations. Design/methodology/approach - This paper empirically analyzes the theoretical arguments with 204 US firms, which registered their patents in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and have been listed in the Compustat database between 2007 and 2010. Findings - The paper suggests that IPR protections brings more benefit to firms with high multinationality and are more export-oriented in terms of developing technological innovation, whereas the effects of international knowledge stock is unclear in the relationship between IPR protection and technological innovation. Research limitations/implications - This study shows the effects of internationalization factors, which provide the benefits of cost efficiency and of more resource accessibility on the relationship between IPR protection regime and a firm's technological innovation. The implication for policy makers and firm managers is that utilizing internationalization resources and capabilities is essential in developing their firms' technological innovation under a strong IPR protection. Originality/value - This paper enriches the literature of IPRs and offers the direction for future research on how a firm's internationalization matters in its innovative activities under IPR protection.",2017,Business & Economics

Biotechnology Patenting in Small Countries-Strategies for the International Marketplace,biotechnology; patents; PCT; start-ups; patenting strategy; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ECONOMIES; SCIENCE; FIRMS,"The article investigates the conventional strategy for obtaining international patent protection by starting with the national patent application, then converting it to the international Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application and filing for a national phase in the jurisdiction(s) of interest, in the context of biotechnology start-ups in small countries. Specifically, we investigate whether such strategy is detrimental or beneficial for the eventual entry to the U.S. market. An empirical study of Lithuanian biotech start-ups is presented, producing evidence that many firms did not benefit from going through the traditional strategy. Eventual strategic choices may depend on the goals the firm wants to achieve, as well as its resources available for international patenting. If the firm intends to license the technology which is the subject matter of the patent application, or attract U.S.-based venture capital, it may benefit from tailoring the patent application to the U.S. and filing there at an early (or at least earlier) stage.",2016,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology
Intellectual property rights and innovation: A panel analysis,Innovation; Intellectual property rights; Patent strength; Patent enforcement; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; PATENT RIGHTS; PROTECTION,"We investigate the relationship between intellectual property rights (IPR) and innovation, for a panel of 48 countries between 1998 and 2011. Prior empirical studies mainly focus on strength of patent regulations largely ignoring the enforcement of such laws in practice. We employ a new index that accounts for the enforcement related component of the patent system and the Ginarte and Park (1997) index of patent regulatory strength. We thus include two crucial elements of a national patent system, the de jure position relating to book law and IPR regulations, and the de facto position relating to IPR enforcement. We consider nonlinearities between IPR and innovation, and we find that both nonlinearities and the enforcement aspect are significant in explaining the relationship between innovation and IPR systems.

Geographical differences in intellectual property strategies and outcomes: establishment-level analysis across the American settlement hierarchy,technological innovation; non-technological innovation; rural?urban; strategic misspecification; exporting; increasing market share; TRADE MARKS; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; INNOVATION; PATENTS,"The wealth of utility patent data has made this form of intellectual property (IP) protection the primary focus of the economics and geography of innovation. However, in addition to utility patents, the IP expressed in a firm's products or processes may also be protected via design patents, trademarks, copyright, or in non-compete and non-disclosure agreements. Recent research suggests that mixed modes of technological and non-technological innovation are associated with the most rapid firm growth and, thus, mixed-mode IP strategies may provide important insight for understanding the geography of innovation. If non-technological IP is an important complement to technological IP, then analyses focusing solely on the impacts of patents are misspecified. In addition, if the capability for pursuing these various tactics differs across the settlement hierarchy, then our understanding of the geography of IP is similarly distorted by the singular focus on patents. The objectives of this study are to examine how these tactics of protection are combined into IP strategies, how these strategies vary over the settlement hierarchy, how the different strategies are associated with different economic outcomes, and how these different strategic orientations may differentiate entrepreneurial ecosystems across space.",2019,Geography
Myths of the medical methods exclusion: medicine and patents in nineteenth century Britain,methods of medical treatment; patent history; parliamentary rewards; REWARDS; CREDIT,"This paper explores the interaction of British medical practitioners with the nascent intellectual property system in the nineteenth century. It challenges the generally accepted view that throughout the nineteenth century there was a settled or professionally agreed hostility to patenting. It demonstrates that medical practitioners made more substantial use of the patent system and related forms of protection than has previously been recognised. Nevertheless, the rate of patenting remained lower than in other fields of technical endeavour, but this can largely be explained by the public nature of medical practice during this period. This paper therefore seeks to retell the history of the exclusion of medical methods from patent protection, an exclusion whose history has produced a substantial body of scholarship. However, its aims go beyond this in that it also seeks to illuminate how medical practitioners engaged with the broader political and policy landscape in order to secure financial remuneration for their inventions. Through an exploration of how prominent doctors interacted with Parliament around claims for a financial reward, it demonstrates that doctors sought to use reputational advantage to leverage financial success and the important role that Parliament could play in that process.",2018,Government & Law
WHY DO STARTUPS USE TRADE SECRETS?,; BIG SECRETS; PATENTS; PROTECTION; MECHANISMS; INNOVATION; APPROPRIATION; STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE; ECONOMICS; VENTURES,"Empirical studies of the use of trade secrecy are scant, and those focusing on startups, nonexistent. In this Article, we present the first set of data-drawn from the Berkeley Patent Survey-on the use of trade secrets by U.S. startup companies in the software, biotechnology, medical device, and hardware industries. Specifically, we report on the prevalence of trade secrecy usage among startups. Additionally, we assess the importance of trade secrets in relation to other forms of intellectual property protection and barriers to entry, such as patents, copyrights, first-mover advantage, and complementary assets. We segment these results by a variety of factors, including industry, company business model, overall revenue, patenting propensity, funding sources, innovation types, and licensing. From this segmentation, we implement a basic regression model and report on those factors showing a statistically significant relationship in the use of trade secrets by startups. Our results point to three major findings. First, trade secrecy serves other important aims aside from first-mover advantage. Second, trade secrets may act both as economic complements and substitutes to patenting. Third, trade secrets may serve as important strategic assets, functioning much in the same manner as patents in terms of licensing and setting the boundaries of the firm.",2018,Government & Law

The purposes of our study were to identify what industries in South Korea are strong or weak in terms of patent applications and to identify some strategies to enable weak industries to become strong. For this, we gathered statistics on seven variables as follows: number of businesses, number of employees, research and development investment, number of full-time equivalent researchers, number of research institutions, domestic market size, and number of patent applications. Especially, to compare the ratio of patent applications and the ratio of domestic market size across industries, the industries were classified into the following three categories: strong-, weak-, and no-patent. Furthermore, data envelopment analysis (DEA) suggested some strategies to strengthen patent applications for each industry. In the DEA analysis, the number of patent applications was used as the output variable and the other six variables were used as input variables.

This paper discusses the foundations of the appropriability trade-off, highlights the crucial distinction between inter- and intra-industry spillovers, and advocates the introduction of patents based on a combination of property and liability rules. These two-layered patents would include: (i) exclusive protection which applies the property rule to intra-industry spillovers: Rivals and competitors in the same product market would be unable to use proprietary patented knowledge without authorization from the patent holder which had exclusive intellectual property rights on its knowledge, and (ii) non-exclusive patents characterized by compulsory licensing which applies the liability rule to inter-industry spillovers.

The first public move of the Internet giant to defend Android application developers from patent lawsuits, this filing is just one of a growing number of initiatives undertaken by platform leaders to protect independent complementors against patent litigation threats. We examine the emerging evidence on platform leaders' initiatives to provide patent shelter for their partners, which we argue helps maintain and reinforce the platform ecosystem. Platform leaders' defensive responses are directed at two different levels: (1) providing umbrella protection to the whole platform, and (2) offering defensive intervention in specific cases. We propose a conceptual framework that categorizes platform leaders' case-specific reactions under three different scenarios and look at the evolution of patent sheltering over time and the practical implications of its emergence.",2016,Business & Economics; Engineering
Why do patents facilitate trade in technology? Testing the disclosure and appropriation effects,Appropriability; Disclosure; Licensing; Market for technology; Patent; MARKET; SENSITIVITY; INNOVATION; ASSETS; IDEAS; BIAS,"Evidence suggests that patents facilitate technology transactions but the reasons for the effect are unclear. Patents may assist trade in technology by either: (i) protecting buyers against the expropriation of the idea (the 'appropriation effect'); or (ii) increasing information sharing during the negotiation phase through publication of technical details contained in the patent document (the 'disclosure effect'). We estimate the strength of both effects using exact matching analysis on a novel dataset of 860 technology transaction negotiations. We find evidence for the appropriation but not the disclosure effect. Technology transaction negotiations involving a granted patent instead of a pending patent (our test for the appropriation effect) are significantly more likely to be successfully completed. The appropriation effect is stronger in technology fields where patent protection is known to be more effective such as biotech, chemicals, drugs and medical. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Creative Destruction and Optimal Patent Life in a Variety-Expanding Growth Model,O31; O34; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; LENGTH; POLICY; NORTH,"This article presents more channels through which the optimal patent life is determined in a R&D-based endogenous growth model with an expanding variety of consumer goods. It features an endogenous hazard rate at which patented firms' monopoly profits are creatively destructed by arrivals of newer varieties, among other things. A patent's effective life is, therefore, endogenized and less than its legal life. This model is calibrated to a global economy with a set of baseline parameter values. The optimal patent length is computed with the algorithm of Golden Search Section, ranging from 17 to 19 years. With the creative-destruction hazard, the world needs a longer patent term to maximize social welfare but with the prevalence of research congestion, the world needs a shorter patent term. However, if the world's aggregate welfare appreciates varieties of goods in a way strong enough, the optimal patent term can surprisingly extend beyond 1000 years!",2015,Business & Economics

While empirical research suggests that scientists exhibit a taste for science, such open disclosures can limit a firm's competitive advantage or ability to profitably commercialize their innovations. To explore how this tension is resolved we focus on the strategic interaction between researchers and firms bargaining over whether (and how) knowledge will be disclosed. We evaluate four disclosure strategies: secrecy, patenting, open science (scientific publication) and patent-paper pairs providing insights into the determinants of the disclosure strategy of a firm. We find that patents and publications can be complementary instruments facilitating the disclosure of knowledge-providing predictions as to when stronger IP protection regimes might drive openness by firms.

We hypothesize that firms with a propensity to patent focus on future technological and market opportunities and do not directly or immediately react to incentives created by environmental policies. Based on negative binomial models, we confirm that eco-patents are stimulated by the expectation of creating technological advancement and new market opportunities. By contrast, energy cost savings can better or more easily be achieved when firms refrain from patenting and concentrate on non-patented innovations or adoption. Favorable framework conditions created by environmental policies and patent protection are also important for eco-patenting, but more in the longer term. Testing the validity of using self-reported eco-innovations, instead of patents, as the dependent variable in simple binomial probit models reveals that product eco-innovations as reported in the surveys are a relatively good proxy for eco-patents. Yet, for product eco-innovations, serving and enlarging current markets is another important reason to innovate.",2017,Development Studies; Public Administration

Logistics estimations based on a sample of 48 Portuguese companies suggest that, considered globally, formal IPR protection is detrimental to the companies' competitiveness. Notwithstanding, when IPR protection mechanisms are discriminated by type, the results indicate that the use of informal protection mechanisms, such as lead time and trade secrets, fosters the companies'competitiveness, whereas the use of formal protection mechanisms, in particular, patents, trademarks and geographical indications, negatively impacts on competitiveness. The size and innovation profile of the company intermediates the influence of IPR protection on its competitiveness. (C) 2018 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge.

In this study, a large panel dataset from 1985 to 2017 was used in an effort to explore how innovation (at the enterprise level), the flying geese model (at the global and national level), and intellectual property rights (IPR) protection (at the governmental level) have facilitated China's sustainable economic development (SED). We employed ridge regression to compensate for the obvious multicollinearity among independent variables. For control purposes, we included multiple variables, namely, population, the labor force, the exchange rate, human capital, and research and development (R&D) expenditures. The results show that all three factors have significant explanatory power for China's SED. First, either Total domestic patent applications or Total domestic patent grants by Chinese enterprises have overtaken those by their foreign counterparts and become a powerful engine for China's SED. However, we understand that patent applications as a measure of innovation could overestimate China's innovation capability more than patent grants. Second, the flying geese model can explain not only China's SED but also China's innovation diffusion at the global and national levels. From 1985 to 1992, China's industrialization and innovation were mainly driven endogenously; from 1993 to 2008, they were simultaneously driven exogenously and endogenously. Since 2009, they have gradually become predominantly endogenously driven. Third, China's IPR protection has grown increasingly tighter at the governmental level, which has further facilitated China's SED. About 98.5% (annually) of patent infringement disputes through the administrative protection system could be closed promptly between 2014 and 2017. Additionally, the proportion of infringed patent rights holders from foreign countries has been declining in recent years. The results significantly enrich the extant theories, and the analysis also has several key implications for actions that should be taken to maintain China's sustainable economic growth; specifically, China should (1) keep its opening-up policy so as to continually expand exports and attract foreign direct investment (FDI); (2) encourage innovation activities from domestic enterprises since they have been the stimulus of China's SED; (3) improve its IPR protection system, particularly its judicial protection system, so as to form a virtuous circle of innovation in China.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

This article examines such a historical case, when Switzerland revised its patent law in 1907, to extend patent protection to chemicals. This was largely due to the pressure exerted by the German government and to the lobbying of the country's chemical industry. Examining closely the elaboration of the new patent law, the article reveals how unstable the category of patents cm chemical inventions was. It did not simply cross a border, being exported from Germany to Switzerland. As Swiss politicians and industrialists discussed the new patent law, they referred to other countries, but they did not only copy, they also rejected some of their features. The reasons for this instability were not to be found only in the pressure and criticism exerted by Germany, or the willingness to protect the interests of the Swiss chemical industry.

Intelligent collaborative patent mining using excessive topic generation,Technology mining; Excessive topic generation; Industrial immersive patenting; Patent data visualization; ,"An inevitable consequence of the technology-driven economy has led to the increased importance of intellectual property protection through patents. Recent global pro-patenting shifts have further resulted in high technology overlaps. Technology components are now spread across a huge corpus of patent documents making its interpretation a knowledge-intensive engineering activity. Intelligent collaborative patent mining facilitates the integration of inputs from patented technology components held by diverse stakeholders. Topic generative models are powerful natural language tools used to decompose data corpus topics and associated word bag distributions. This research develops and validates a superior text mining methodology, called Excessive Topic Generation (ETG), as a preprocessing framework for topic analysis and visualization. The presented ETG methodology adapts the topic generation characteristics from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with added capability to generate word distance relationships among key terms. The novel ETG approach is used as the core process for intelligent collaborative patent mining. A case study of 741 global Industrial Immersive Technology (ITT) patents covering inventive and novel concepts of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Brain Machine Interface (BMI) are systematically processed and analyzed using the proposed methodology.

European Patent Reforms: Transforming European Patent Governance and Enhancing Collaborative Innovation?,Collaborative innovation; dynamic governance; European Union; governance; patent law; patent reforms; unitary patent; SYSTEM,"The main objective of the current chapter is to examine to what extent the European patent system, the decision-making process on the so-called Patent Package and its implementation reflect the conceptual framework of dynamic governance, a framework which aligns closely with the notion of collaborative innovation. In the global patent context, a gradual increase of more dynamic patent governance has been observed. The adoption of fundamental patent reforms in Europe calls for a review of those reforms from a dynamic governance perspective. After decades of negotiations on the European Union (EU) patent, the financial crisis has finally driven the EU Member States and the EU institutions to gain the momentum and to adopt a compromise on the Patent Package. These reforms are aimed at simplifying the European patent system, lowering the costs of patenting, improving legal certainty and limiting forum-shopping in terms of litigation. These objectives were supported widely by stakeholders. However, despite these laudable objectives, the way the decision-making process was spun out and then suddenly rushed through and the actual content of the package are highly controversial. In the end, the reforms will further increase the complexity of the European patent system, patent protection in Europe will probably remain rather expensive and the risk of forum shopping may continue to persist to a certain extent. This raises the fundamental question whether stakeholders have actually been sufficiently involved in the decision-making process.",2015,Area Studies; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics

INTELLIGENT DESIGN,; PATENT; COPYRIGHT; LAW,"When designers obtain exclusive intellectual property (IP) rights in the functional aspects of their creations, they can wield these rights to increase both the costs to their competitors and the prices that consumers must pay for their goods. IP rights and the costs they entail are justified when they create incentives for designers to invest in new, socially valuable designs. But the law must be wary of allowing rights to be misused. Accordingly, IP law has employed a series of doctrinal and costly screens to channel designs into the appropriate regime- copyright law, design patent law, or utility patent law -depending upon the type of design. Unfortunately, those screens are no longer working. Designers are able to obtain powerful IP protection over the utilitarian aspects of their creations without demonstrating that they have made socially valuable contributions. They are also able to do so without paying substantial fees that might weed out weaker, socially costly designs. This is bad for competition and bad for consumers. In this Article, we integrate theories of doctrinal and costly screens and explore their roles in channeling IP rights. We explain the inefficiencies that have arisen through the misapplication of these screens in copyright and design patent laws. Finally, we propose a variety of solutions that would move design protection toward a successful channeling regime, balancing the law's needs for incentives and competition. These proposals include improving doctrinal screens to weed out functionality, making design protection more costly, and preventing designers from obtaining multiple forms of protection for the same design.",2018,Government & Law
The relation of patent description and examination with validity: an empirical study,Patent validity; Patent description; Patent examination; Invalidation trials; Selection bias; GRANTS,"This paper describes an empirical study to identify factors of patent description and examination that affect the outcome of later challenges to patent validity. Using ternary dummy variables based on the change in the scope of protection before and after Japanese invalidation trials as the dependent variable, the study compares models estimated by ordered and binary logistic regression. The standardized length of the first part of the description explaining the prior art, and the second part explaining the details of the invention, were found to relate to the maximum and minimum survival of patents, respectively. Other factors were also identified. Different modes of survival are discussed. Models on the likelihood of a challenge to patent validity were also estimated. The variables related to patent validity were compared to those related to the likelihood of a challenge. This revealed factors affected by selection biases based on the opponent's decision to make the challenge. Factors including the first and second parts of the description were not affected by selection biases and thus confirmed to be related to patent validity. Factors that not only affect patent validity but also affect an opponent's decision to challenge patent validity are also discussed.",2017,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science

However, developing countries have made surprisingly little use of the freedom to design their own systems in this field. Instead, there has been a surge in UPOV membership among developing countries and some have gone as far as introducing patent protection for plant varieties. Such countries now have to consider the same exclusions and exceptions to patenting that are normally discussed in countries with much more advanced biotechnology industries. The chapter examines the scope for the use of orde public considerations under Article 27.2 TRIPS, of exceptions for research and experimental purposes under Article 30 TRIPS, compulsory licensing under Article 31 TRIPS as well as the advantages of a specific breeding exemption and it briefly comments on the various sui generis options. While liberal interpretations of the TRIPS exceptions remain possible, the chapter concludes that the majority of developing countries will be better off in more creatively using the freedom to develop sui generis systems suitable for their local conditions rather than struggling to introduce TRIPS conform 'limited exceptions' to patent protection for plant varieties.",2016,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law
Fuzzy front end patent management and innovation performance Mediating role of patent commercialization and moderating effect of technological lock-in,Technological innovation; Patent management; Innovation performance; Fuzzy front end; Technological lock-in; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PREDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; OUTPUT INDICATORS; FIRM; KNOWLEDGE; MARKETS; ACQUISITIONS; SPILLOVERS,"Purpose - As a resource input in enterprise technological innovation, patents play an important role in influencing innovation performance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of fuzzy front end (FFE) patent management on innovation performance, and the mediating role of patent commercialization and the moderating effect of technological lock-in. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a questionnaire survey from a sample of 203 high-tech Chinese enterprises across multiple industries. Structural equation modeling and the hierarchical regression method were used to test the hypothesis. Findings - The results show that the FFE of patent management, namely, patent acquisition and patent protection, positively affect innovation performance. Specifically, patent commercialization mediates the relationship between FFE patent management and innovation performance. Moreover, technological lock-in moderates the relationship between patent management and innovation performance. Practical implications - This study puts forward suggestions relating to institution innovation and mechanism innovation for effective patent management in firms, and provides some guidelines for firms to efficiently utilize patents to improve innovation performance. Originality/value - This paper provides certain empirical evidence for the study of organizational structure, strategic management, and knowledge governance. As the main participators in technology innovation, high-tech enterprises should utilize both inside and outside resources to acquire patents.",2017,Business & Economics
RITALIN TO ROUNDUP: EXPANDING THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY STATUTORY EXPERIMENTAL USE EXCEPTION TO AGRICULTURE,; PATENTS; SCIENCE; GENES; DNA; ACT,"The modern agricultural biotechnology industry developed from a small cottage industry based on selective crop breeding into a multibillion dollar industry based on the isolation and insertion of genes that code for commercially valuable crop traits. As it grew, the industry relied on patent protection to recoup its investment into new research and development of genetically engineered (GE) crops. A recent billion dollar patent infringement damage award to Monsanto based only on research activities of its competitors testifies to the importance of that patent protection. Had the Monsanto patent infringement case been between two pharmaceutical companies creating genetics based drugs, the outcome would have been different. Instead of a one billion dollar award, the patent verdict would have been one of noninfringement. The difference between the two patent infringement cases lies with the Hatch-Waxman Act's statutory experimental use exception. The Hatch Waxman Act controls the regulation of generic drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Along with an abbreviated generic drug approval process, the Hatch Waxman Act includes a statutory experimental use exception to patent infringement allowing pharmaceutical companies to conduct research on patented drugs if the research might be used in a regulatory submission to the FDA. This Article explores the history of the statutory experimental use exception and argues that it should apply to the agricultural biotechnology industry's development of GE crops. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the statute has resulted in a very broad experimental use exception, limited only by whether an invention is regulated by the FDA. Since GE crops are regulated by the FDA, the statutory experimental use exception should apply to their development. Such a broadening of the experimental use exception would have potentially vast impacts on the patent valuations as well as the structure of the entire agricultural biotechnology industry.",2016,Government & Law

To help resolve this controversy, the Article introduces a contract approach to patent infringement and develops a methodology for finding reasonable royalty damages. The contract approach complements approaches based on property and tort, thus providing a more complete understanding of damages. The Article introduces the concept of an informed contract as the basis for damages. The Article argues that an informed contract improves estimation of damages by taking into account information revealed during the period of infringement. The Article also introduces a market value method for calculating reasonable royalty damages based on patent transfer prices. The contract approach helps calculate reasonable royalty damages based on royalties in comparable patent licenses. The contract approach addresses various controversies over reasonable royalty damages.",2019,Government & Law

Firms improve the targeted products by randomly combining existing technologies owned by other firms. Furthermore, the firms contribute to the adoption of newly developed frontier technology. The innovators must attain the minimum innovation size required for a patent. That is, the patent office grants patents only for superior innovations. We show that an increase in the minimum innovation size may reduce the average patentable innovation size because of an endogenous response of the distribution of innovation size. This implies that even if the patent office requires superior innovations in order to assign patents, innovators tend to produce inferior patentable innovations on average. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Edge-between clustering and key-route main path analysis are employed to complementarily accomplish the task. This study retrieves patenting related articles covering 1970 to 2013 from Web of Science (WOS) and constructs the citation network among them. The edge-betweenness clustering technique and key-route main path analysis are then applied to identify the major research themes and development trajectories of patenting research. Eight major research themes are identified: 'citation network analysis', 'patent law', 'patent valuation', 'academic patenting', 'gene patenting', 'patent policy', 'patent protection', and 'technology analysis'. The linkage among these eight research themes is exhibited, along with a presentation of the statistics of top influential journals and authors. This study demonstrates that the approach used herein is a powerful way to determine the major research themes and development trajectories of a target academic field. The approach is also applicable to any other data with citation relationships. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2016,Business & Economics; Public Administration
SUSTAINABLE USE OF GENETIC RESOURCES AND TRADITIONAL MEDICINAL KNOWLEDGE: INDONESIAN PERSPECTIVE ON UTILIZATION PRESERVATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF CULTURE,Genetic Resources; Traditional Medicinal Knowledge; National Medicine Patent Development; Collective Action; ,"Prof. James W. Black, 1988 Nobel Prize Winner of Medicine said: the most fruitful basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug, this statement shown significant roles of long existed traditional medicine as the prior art in medicine product development. Many modern drugs and vaccines are based on Genetic Resources (GR) and Traditional Medicinal Knowledge (TMK). Patent protection for medicines derived from GR processed with TMK have been major discussions and raised uptight antagonism between developing countries and developed countries. From economic view, the word herbal market continue to rise and estimated will reach US $ 150 billion by 2020. Despite the bio-diversity richness with at least 30.000 species of medicinal plants and the issuing of significant laws that potentially play significant roles in national medicine patent development, the statistical data of Indonesian Patent Office shows unfortunate irony in 2016 where domestic patent registration was only 1.440 comparing to 7.766 foreign patents, with 96 % on medicine registered patents were for foreign products. This paper will focus on the quest for intersection between proper utilization, strategic promotion and comprehensive protection of genetic resources and traditional medicinal knowledge according to national patent law and the law of advancement of culture. The result shows that the key points lies in improvement of normative legal framework and operation system by creating legal and functional platform to regulate and implementing proper utilization, strategic promotion and comprehensive preservation of GR and TMK sustainably and productively to escalate national medicine development that serve community empowerment, utility and economic growth..",2019,Government & Law
Innovation and Patent Protection: A Multicountry Study on the Determinants of R&D Offshoring,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; MULTINATIONAL FIRMS; JAPANESE FIRMS; MARKET; INTERNATIONALIZATION; POLICY,"This paper looks at the role that intellectual property rights (IPR) protection plays in the decision of multinational corporations (MNCs) to locate their R&D activities abroad, a phenomenon which has been labelled in the literature as innovation offshoring. Do countries with stronger IPRs attract more offshored innovation? Do different types of innovation offshoring respond equally to IPR variations? Using a novel multicountry and multisector database gathering information on the innovation activity of more than 15,000 MNCs from all around the world, I am able to distinguish among two types of innovation offshoring: innovation carried out in nations different from the home country, where the firm undertakes production activities directly or indirectly through a subsidiary (commercial innovation), and research done in countries, where the MNC only collaborates with local firms or inventors, with no on-site production involved (external innovation). In order to better isolate the impact of property rights protection on R&D, my identification strategy takes into consideration IPR's variation across industries. I find that firms tend to locate commercial innovation in countries with strong IPR protection. This is true especially for long life-cycle industries which rely longer on patents. In contrast, short life-cycle technologies with faster obsolescence rate (e.g. high-tech products) are less responsive to IPR protection. External innovation, on the other hand, is less affected by patent protection, suggesting other motives behind its location decisions.",2018,Business & Economics
Patent Ethics: The Misalignment of Views Between the Patent System and the Wider Society,Ethics; Patents; Biotechnology; Ordre public and morality; ISSUES; BIOTECHNOLOGY; PERSPECTIVE; LEGITIMACY; INTERESTS; KNOWLEDGE; LEGAL,"Concerns have been voiced about the ethical implications of patenting practices in the field of biotechnology. Some of these have also been incorporated into regulation, such as the European Commission Directive 98/44 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions. However, the incorporation of ethically based restrictions into patent legislation has not had the effect of satisfying all concerns. In this article, we will systematically compare the richness of ethical concerns surrounding biotech patenting, with the limited scope of ethical concerns actually addressed in the patent system. As sources of our analyses we will use literature and document studies and a survey with important stakeholders and experts related to Norwegian patenting in the aquacultural biotechnology sector. We will structure the analyses with an ethical matrix, developed for this purpose. Showing the misalignment of the discussions within and outside the patent system, we suggest that an important reason for the ethical controversy still surrounding patenting is that ethical questions keep being framed in a narrow way within the system. Until a richer set of ethical considerations is addressed head-on within the patent system, the patent system will continue to evoke academic and interest group criticism, potentially contributing to a legitimacy crisis of the whole system.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Engineering; History & Philosophy of Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Philosophy
How Does Stronger Protection of Intellectual Property Rights Affect National Pharmaceutical Expenditure? An Analysis of OECD Countries,intellectual property right; patent; pharmaceutical expenditure; high-income countries; PATENT PROTECTION; TRIPS-PLUS; ESSENTIAL MEDICINES; HEALTH EXPENDITURE; WELFARE-STATE; DETERMINANTS; ACCESS; IMPACT; INNOVATION; INFANT,"Intellectual property rights (IPR) protection for pharmaceuticals has been comprehensive and strict since the establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995 and the subsequent implementation of the TRIPS Agreement. This study investigated the relationship between the level of IPR and national pharmaceutical expenditure using panel data of 22 OECD countries from 1970 to 2009. The patent index was used to measure the level of national protection for IPR along with other covariates: GDP per capita, the percentage of population aged over 65, number of doctors, proportion of public financing among total pharmaceutical expenditure, under-5 mortality, price index, and period indicators. The regression analysis results showed that the level of IPR protection was significantly correlated with pharmaceutical spending even after controlling for various factors that affect pharmaceutical expenditure. The results were consistent in OLS regression and GLS regression. However, the effect of IPR was stronger and more significant in countries with a relatively small-sized pharmaceutical market than in those with big market. Many developed countries incur a financial burden due to rapidly growing pharmaceutical expenditure; therefore, the results of this study present the possibility that stronger IPR would produce welfare loss in developed countries.",2018,Health Care Sciences & Services
Patent Education and System Construction in Research Universities,Research university; Patent; Education; Construction; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS,"The global economy and culture competition in the 21st century is becoming increasingly fierce and the essence of this is the competition of knowledge and talents. Therefore, the protection of patent rights and the cultivation of talents with patent knowledge are becoming more important. Colleges and universities are the training base for talents and they are the hub for turning knowledge into actual productivity. It is of great significance for the improvement of students' quality and scientific and technological progress to extensively implement patent education in research universities which attach great emphasis on the cultivation of innovative talents. However, China's patent education started relatively late, and there are still many problems in the actual development process. This paper investigates the status quo of education, summarizes and analyzes the existing problems and draws on the experience of patent education in developed countries through the research on patent education in research universities in a province. Also, this paper proposes the suggestions for the construction of patent education in research universities in China from the perspective of breaking through the educational concept and enriching the structure of teachers.",2018,Education & Educational Research
Protecting Trade Secrets in Canada,; ,"Patents in the life sciences industries are a key form of intellectual property (IP), particularly for products such as brand-name drugs and medical devices. However, trade secrets can also be a useful tool for many types of innovations. In appropriate cases, trade secrets can offer long-term protection of IP for a lower financial cost than patenting. This type of protection must be approached with caution as there is little room for error when protecting a trade secret. Strong agreements and scrupulous security can help to protect the secret. Once a trade secret is disclosed to the public, it cannot be restored as the owner's property; however, if the information is kept from the public domain, the owner can have a property right of unlimited duration in the information. In some situations patents and trade secrets may be used cooperatively to protect innovation, particularly for manufacturing processes.",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine

Using patents and citations scaled by R&D expenses and R&D capital as measures of innovation efficiency, we find that multinational firms have lower levels of innovation efficiency than purely domestic firms. This finding has been supported by additional evidence using peer pressure as an exogenous shock to firms' strategy of going international. We also find that information asymmetry and the low cost of capital could be the major channels through which global diversification impacts innovation efficiency adversely. Our results further suggest that innovation efficiency is more valuable to multinational firms that mainly diversify into developed markets or markets with better patent protection.

We emphasize that foreign licensor chooses the quality of licensed technology when the licensee country does not implement perfect intellectual property protection for licensor's technology. We study quality choice as the foreign licensor's selection for a particular grade of technical skills. We show that fixed fee emerges as the equilibrium licensing scheme when both the transfer of his technology is relatively efficient and the licensee is sufficiently cost competitive in the domestic market, and that royalty licensing prevails otherwise. We further show it need not hold the general belief that welfare in the licensor country unambiguously rise with a stronger patenting system in the licensee country when, in particular, such patenting system in place is sufficiently lax.",2017,Business & Economics

The region's competitiveness depends on intellectual activity and the status of patent information resources. Designers and inventors have to study the global experience in designing technological objects and to know the trends in their area of specialization. This task can be accomplished, in particular, through the patent research using information resources. When designing new products and upgrading the old ones, a person demonstrates his or her creativity and solves many inventive problems. Recommendation to include clauses on legal protection of intellectual products into the state contracts is substantiated. The conclusion is made that efficient implementation of modern information technologies ensures efficient building, dissemination and use of patent knowledge.",2019,Information Science & Library Science

We report the urgent but successful deployment of such a filter in a patient with a single patent internal carotid artery. Although stroke rates observed in first-generation TAVI trials were higher than those reported following conventional open aortic valve replacement, adjunctive neuroprotective measures, particularly in patients with a large amount of threatened cerebral territory, may minimize potential neurologic injury. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12347 (J Card Surg 2015;30:260-262)",2015,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Surgery

The purpose of this paper is to advance this area of research by examining how the use of external patent attorneys influences the patent filing strategies of firms and what impact firms' level of experience with the exclusive use of in-house resources has on filing strategies. This study, thus, provides insights into the strategic dimension behind patent filing, a process which is affected by patent attorneys' work and decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach - The econometric analysis is based on a patent database of 922,553 patents which is combined with an EPO patent database covering applications from 1990 to 2010. The authors test the hypotheses for this study using patent indicators addressing the impact of in-house firm experience vs the use of external patent attorneys on firm's filing strategy. Findings - This research finds empirical evidence that external patent attorneys' work has an effect on patent scope, international scope, and patenting speed. Moreover, it can be shown that external patent attorneys have a positive impact on most filing dimensions, such as patent scope, international scope and the Patent Cooperation Treaty option, whereas the level of in-house firm experience has a negative impact on most filing dimensions. This implies that external patent attorneys seem to pursue a maximization approach while experienced firms seem to pursue a more differentiated approach to filing patents, for instance, drafting narrower and more focused patents. Practical implications - The study suggests that effective filing strategies require an integrated approach between diverse IP stakeholders. More particularly, filing strategies should be communicated and aligned between all actors, including external patent attorneys in order to achieve the targeted patenting output. Originality/value - The current study develops a patent filing typology, which accounts for patent attorneys' decision options. In providing insights into patent attorneys' work and their impacts on intellectual property rights management, the study is a useful complement to prior research, which has predominantly focused on applicants or examiners.",2017,Business & Economics

This article describes a relatively straightforward approach to measuring patent value with aggregate market data and the BLP model. We apply the approach to United States smartphones. The demand estimates and recovered marginal costs produce sensible simulations of equilibria prices and shares from several hypothetical patent infringements. In one simulation, the presence of near field communication on the dominant firm's flagship smartphone results in a 29% increase in profits. This estimate provides a starting point for establishing a reasonable royalty between the patent holder and the dominant firm in a hypothetical negotiation. This simulation also shows that law-abiding firms inside the market may be damaged by the dominant firm's patent infringing behavior. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The World's Best Carpets Erastus Bigelow and the Financing of Antebellum Innovation,; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PATENT; ECONOMY; HISTORY; MARKET,"The business records of textile entrepreneur and inventor Erastus Bigelow offer extraordinary detail about how financing innovation worked on the ground in the antebellum United States. For the first decades of the nineteenth century, increasing numbers of Americans sought patent protection, even as patents often brought little monetary benefit or status to their holders. Historians have tended to look to the court system to account for why this was the case, even though only a small percentage of patent holders ever litigated. This article, by contrast, examines the securitization of patents, which many inventors increasingly saw as supple tools to secure research funds and monetize intellectual property. As individuals and firms bought and sold patents for cash, labor contracts, and funding for further research and development, they shaped an evolving market for intellectual property. Throughout the nineteenth century, this market offered inventors increasing opportunities to offload the risks, and sometimes the rewards, of invention.",2018,History & Philosophy of Science
Institutional Design and the Nature of Patents,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ASSIGNMENT,"What is a patent? That is, what is the nature of a patent? This question has split patent law. Some scholars (and judges) have argued that patents should be understood as a species of property, akin to plots of land, while others have reasoned that patents are best understood as a type of regulatory license, like Environmental Protection Agency permits to pollute. This debate has assumed multiple methodological forms as well. Some scholars (and judges) have approached the question from a formalist perspective, asking what other legal instruments patents most resemble, or how they have been treated historically. Others have approached it from a more functionalist perspective, asking instead what purpose patents are meant to serve and what legal rules would best effectuate that purpose. This debate has significant ramifications for many of patent law's most important institutional questions, including the allocation of power between the Federal Circuit and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), the constitutionality of inter partes review, and the legality of the PTO Director's practice of choosing which patent judges should sit on Patent Trial and Review Board panels. Yet the debate has also largely been submerged. Courts and scholars have often failed to recognize this central schism in patent law. The result is that proponents of each side of the debate have frequently talked past one another without acknowledging the fundamental conceptual principles that divide them. The primary object of this Essay is to describe and explain the deep structure of this disagreement. The Essay then turns to the institutional consequences of arriving at a conclusion regarding the nature of patents. I demonstrate that once one has arrived at a conceptual understanding of patents, answers to the most consequential institutional questions fall neatly into place.",2019,Government & Law

In particular, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) registered an increasing trend in patenting, exceeding large firms in the number of patent registrations. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the association between patents and SME sales performance, taking into consideration also patent quality. Design/methodology/approach - The approach uses panel regression model to investigate the relationship between patenting and sales, controlling for firm size and firm age. The authors adopt a purposive sampling technique focusing on a sample of Italian SMEs in the mechanical industry. Findings - The results show that the count of patents do not have any effect on sales performance, while the number of jurisdictions where the protection is extended produces a positive and significant result. Practical implications - The main implication for SME entrepreneurs and managers is that relying on a large number of patents does not automatically lead to higher performance; instead, filing those patents which protect particularly valuable innovations could be more productive in terms of SME sales performance Moreover, the results suggest that a longer time lag between patent filing and SME sales performance might be possible. Originality/value - This paper is one of first attempts to shed light on the issue regarding SMEs patent quality. It is notable that the quality of patents in terms of geographical scope is positively associated to SME sales performance.",2015,Business & Economics

Continental drift? Do European clinical genetic testing laboratories have a patent problem?,; DNA PATENTS; PROVISION; MYRIAD,"Recent US Supreme Court decisions have invalidated patent claims on isolated genomic DNA, and testing methods that applied medical correlations using conventional techniques. As a consequence, US genetic testing laboratories have a relatively low risk of infringing patents on naturally occurring DNA or methods for detecting genomic variants. In Europe, however, such claims remain patentable, and European laboratories risk infringing them. We report the results from a survey that collected data on the impact of patents on European genetic testing laboratories. The results indicate that the proportion of European laboratories that have refrained from providing associated testing services owing to patent protection has increased over the last decade (up from 7% in 2008 to 15% in 2017), and that the non-profit sector was particularly strongly affected (up from 4% in 2008 to 14% in 2017). We renew calls for more readily available legal support to help public sector laboratories deal with patent issues, but we do not recommend aligning European law with US law at present. Watchful monitoring is also recommended to ensure that patents do not become a greater hindrance for clinical genetic testing laboratories.",2019,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Genetics & Heredity
International R&D funding and patent collateral in an R&D-based growth model,International R&D funding; Patent collateral; R&D-based growth model; Optimal patent protection; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; POLICY; INVESTMENT; SCALE,"This paper develops an R&D-based growth model featuring international R&D funding and patent collateral. Several main findings emerge from the analysis. First, with an inelastic labor supply, a rise in the fraction of patent collateral is beneficial to both innovations and economic growth. Second, when labor supply is inelastic, a rise in either the foreign interest rate or the fraction of borrowed R&D funding is harmful to innovations and economic growth. Third, our numerical results show that the above two findings are robust when labor is supplied elastically. Finally, our numerical results indicate that, regardless of whether labor supply is inelastic or elastic, the government can implement an optimal patent breadth policy to maximize the social welfare level. Our numerical results also point out that this optimal patent breadth will decrease in response to a reduction in the foreign interest rate, a rise in the fraction of the collateral, and a reduction in the fraction of borrowed R&D labor costs.",2017,Business & Economics
The Impact of Myriad and Mayo: Will Advancements in the Biological Sciences Be Spurred or Disincentivized?

Similarly, methods in which the detection of a biological substance (e.g., in a blood sample) dictates subsequent actions, as in disease diagnostics and treatment, have long enjoyed patent protection. However, two recent Supreme Court cases, Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. (133 S. Ct. 2107) (2013) and Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (132 S.

The highest court in our land unanimously agreed with patent challengers that much of what we took for granted as patentable subjectmatter is not, as amatter of law, eligible for patenting after all. This review discusses the Myriad and Mayo cases, their impact on which biologybased innovationswemayormay not continue to patent, andwhether the altered status quo is benignly corrective or gravely disruptive. Is what happened here a good thing or not?",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine

This article uses an original data-set of patents assigned to defense-servicing organizations to investigate the diffusion of military technologies. Contrary to the predictions of the prevailing scholarship, I find no difference in the rate of diffusion between civilian and military technologies. Neither do military technologies assigned to government agencies diffuse at different rates than those assigned to firms. The overall technological experience of the patent assignee is found to be a positive predictor of the diffusion of military technologies. The effect of the prevailing intellectual property rights regime is ambivalent: when US patents are included in the sample, the effect of patent protection is positive, when the US is excluded, the effect is either non-significant or negative depending on the model specification that is utilized.",2018,Business & Economics
"Do patents work? Thickets, trolls and antibiotic resistance",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MARKET-STRUCTURE; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; POOLS; COMPETITION; PHARMACEUTICALS; PRODUCTIVITY; PROTECTION,"This paper connects ideas from recent literature on the economics of intellectual property (IP) to address the question: Did the strengthening and broadening of IP rights from important patent policy changes in the US promote greater innovation? The analysis rests on the theory of cumulative innovation, which shows that if IP rights on a pioneer invention extend to follow-on research and impediments to contracting exist, then strengthening patents can actually reduce overall innovation. Recent empirical studies are consistent with the theory: patents can significantly deter follow-on research in complex technology areas where contracting is difficult (computers, electronics, telecommunications) but not in drugs, chemicals and human genes. I outline remedies from court decisions and antitrust policy for addressing inefficiencies from patent trolling, patent thickets and the anti-commons of fragmented ownership. I then apply the analysis to the antibiotics market, drawing on recent research, to examine how patent and competition policies can be used to improve incentives for drug development in the battle against antibiotic resistance. The literature provides persuasive evidence that the policy changes overreached in broadening and strengthening IP rights and reveals important patent reforms for improving the effectiveness of patent systems in the US and Canada.",2017,Business & Economics
Do board interlocks increase innovation? Evidence from a corporate governance reform in India,Patents; Peer effects; Director networks; Innovation; India; Natural experiments; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT CITATIONS; FIRM INNOVATION; BUSINESS GROUPS; MARKET VALUE; SPILLOVERS; MATTER,"We examine the effect of board interlocks on patenting and R&D spending for publicly traded companies in India. We exploit a corporate governance reform to address the endogeneity of board interlocks through exogenous changes mandated by the reform requiring a subset of firms to adjust their board structure. We rely on two difference-in-differences frameworks, comparing firms affected by the reform to unaffected firms as well as comparing within the set of firms that did not have to adjust their board structure those that still experienced an exogenous increase of their network size as a result of the reform to those that did not experience a change in their network size. We find that board interlocks have significant positive effects on both R&D and patenting. The evidence suggests that the impact on R&D is induced by information transmission through interlocks. The effect on patenting is driven by firms extending patent protection by patenting inventions abroad that they have already patented in India. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

THE UNEASY CASE FOR PATENT FEDERALISM,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; CIRCUIT; JUDICIARY; ECONOMICS; LAW,"Nationwide uniformity is often considered an essential feature of the patent system, necessary to fulfill that system's disclosure and incentive purposes. In the last few years, however, more than half the states have enacted laws that seek to disrupt this uniformity by making it harder for patent holders to enforce their patents. There is an easy case to be made against giving states greater authority over the patent system: doing so would threaten to disrupt the system's balance between innovation incentives and a robust public domain and would permit rent seeking by states that disproportionately produce or consume innovation. There is, nevertheless, an uneasy case that this particular form of patent federalism may be a good thing. The federal patent system has systemic flaws that lead to low-quality patents, nuisance patent litigation, and patent trolls exploiting asymmetric bargaining power. And efforts to address these flaws have faltered, or have had limited effects, due to publicchoice dynamics in the patent system, so the scope of patent protections has expanded over time without regard to the system's purpose of encouraging innovation. States may help address some of these problems not in spite of, but because of, their own flaws. States have their own public-choice dynamics that happen to offset some of the flaws of the federal system. State antipatent laws have been driven largely by small businesses and local smallbusiness groups, which, unlike most patent holders, have preexisting influence in state government. And the laws they have crafted using this influence are well-targeted to affect only the most troublesome patent cases: nuisance cases, cases asserting low-quality patents, and cases targeting end users. States pushing back with anti-patent laws, then, may represent an effective second-best solution to the problem of harmful patent assertions. Moreover, recognizing the dynamics that led to these laws may provide helpful insights in designing federal patent reforms.",2017,Government & Law

Nanotechnology research develops improved materials, devices, systems and therapeutics. Nanomaterials can be protected for their intellectual property rights by innovators. However, due to the interdisciplinary nature of nanotechnology, there is a risk of overlapping patent claims and lack of distinction between nano-based and traditional patents. Scientists also must solve ethical and social issues, from health to environmental risk and consumer perception. This chapter reviews the status of intellectual property rights protection of nanomaterials. The main points are: concerning patent number, there has been recently a tenfold increase of nanomaterial patents; for instance there has been an increase of granted patents from 386 in 2004 to 1106 in 2014 by the United States Patent and Trademark office. Concerning regulatory and policy bodies, the World Intellectual Property Organization and World Health Organization are working to make a comprehensive intellectual property right regulation for nanotechnology products. The United States is the leader of nanotechnology products development, and has made guidelines to make patent search easier for nano-based product. The European Patent Office has also created a new classification for the nano-based inventions. The chapter also gives emphasis on nanotechnology applications in agriculture, such as nanopesticides and nanobiosensors. Environmental, toxicity and health issues associated with nanotechnology products are mentioned.",2016,Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics
Sustainable Technology Innovation Path Recognition: An Evaluation of Patent Risk of International Trade,sustainable technology innovation; patent risk; analytic hierarchy process; entropy method; international trade; BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION; LITIGATION; DECISION; FIRMS; MANAGERS; CONTEXT; AHP,"Patent protection is a critical aspect of sustainable technology innovation, which is currently facing the challenge of patent risk. This study aimed to help enterprises prevent and avoid patent risk in a global view of technology innovation, and to propose a systematic evaluation model for patent risk. By combining the entropy method with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), this study constructed an analytic hierarchy model of patent risk. Some indexes in the model were selected based on the summary of prior literature, and other indexes were selected according to experts' communication, which helped us to generalize the patent risk as comprehensively as possible. The AHP evaluation results determined the weight and relative materiality for each risk factor, which were contained in a criteria layer and a sub-criteria layer. The entropy method integrated the evaluation weights of different experts' opinions. By dividing the risk factors into three categories, namely high, medium, or low, according to the priority degree, the risk priority ranking was obtained. Suggestions are discussed regarding support for enterprises in dealing with patent risk that may occur during international trade or other commercial activities.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
R&D-based Calibrated Growth Models with Finite-Length Patents: A Novel Relaxation Algorithm for Solving an Autonomous FDE System of Mixed Type,Patent length; Innovation; Delay differential equation; Advance differential equation; Dynamics; Endogenous growth; Relaxation algorithm; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; BLOCKING PATENTS; PROTECTION; DYNAMICS; INVESTMENT; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; LIFE,"The statutory patent length is 20 years in most countries. R&D-based growth models, however, often presume an infinite patent length. In this paper, finite-length patents are embedded in a non-scale R&D-based growth model, while allowing any patent's effective life to be terminated prematurely, subject to two idiosyncratic hazards from imitation and creative destruction. This gives rise to an autonomous system of mixed-type functional differential equations (FDEs) that had never been encountered in the growth literature. Its dynamics are driven by current, delayed and advanced states. We present a relaxation algorithm to solve these FDEs by solving a sequence of standard boundary value problems for systems of ordinary differential equations. We use this algorithm to simulate a calibrated U.S. economy's transitional dynamics by making discrete changes from the baseline 20 years patent length. We find that if transitional impacts are taken into account, the switch to the long-run optimal patent length can incur a welfare loss, albeit rather small.",2018,Business & Economics; Mathematics

This paper introduces a non-parametric method to structurally analyze changes in information and communication technology (ICT) patenting trends as representative outcomes of knowledge creation activity with economic indicators. For this, the authors established a symmetric model that enables several economic contributors to be decomposed through the perspective of ICTs' research and development (R&D) performance, industrial change, and overall manufacturing growth. Additionally, an empirical analysis of some countries from 2001 to 2009 was conducted through this model. This paper found that all countries except the United States experienced an increase of 10.5-267.4% in ICT patent applications, despite fluctuations in the time series. It is interesting that the changes in ICT patenting of each country generally have a negative relationship with the intensity of each country's patent protection system. Positive determinants include ICT R&D productivity and overall manufacturing growth, while ICT industrial change is a negative determinant in almost all countries. This paper emphasizes that each country needs to design strategic plans for effective ICT innovation. In particular, ICT innovation activities need to be promoted by increasing ICT R&D investment and developing the ICT industry, since ICT R&D intensity and ICT industrial change generally have a low contribution to ICT patenting.",2017,Science & Technology - Other Topics
DATA-GENERATING PATENTS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; TRADE SECRETS; HUMAN-GENOME; LAW; ECONOMICS; PROTECTION; SEARCH; SCOPE; ASSOCIATION; COMPETITION,"Patents and trade secrets are often considered economic substitutes. Under this view, inventors can decide either to maintain an invention as a trade secret or to seek a patent and disclose to the public the details of the invention. However, a handful of scholars have recognized that because the patent disclosure requirements are not always rigorous, inventors may sometimes be able to keep certain aspects of an invention secret, yet still receive a patent to the invention as a whole. Here, we provide further insight into how trade secrets and patents may act as complements. Specifically, we introduce the concept of data-generating patents, which refer to patents on inventions involving technologies that by design generate valuable data through their operation or use. For instance, genetic tests and medical devices produce data about patients. Internet search engines and social networking websites generate data about the interests of consumers. When data-generating inventions are patented, and the patentee enjoys market power over the invention, by implication, the patentee also effectively enjoys market power over the data generated by the invention. Trade secret law further protects the patentee's market power over the data, even where that data is in a market distinct from the patented invention and especially after the patent expires or is invalidated. We contend that the use of patents and trade secrets as complements in this manner may sometimes yield socially harmful results. We identify the conditions under which such results occur and make several recommendations to mitigate their effects.",2017,Government & Law
TRIPS Implementation and Secondary Pharmaceutical Patenting in Brazil and India,Pharmaceuticals; Secondary patents; Section 3d; Prior Consent; TRIPS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; DRUG PATENTS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; LAW,"This article compares national approaches towards secondary pharmaceutical patents. Because secondary patents can extend periods of exclusivity and delay generic competition, they can raise prices and reduce access to medicines. Little is known about what measures and policies countries have enacted to address applications for secondary pharmaceutical patents, how they function, and whether, in practice, these measures limit secondary patents. We analyse the cases of India and Brazil. We assemble data on pharmaceutical patent applications filed in the two countries, code each application to identify which constitute secondary applications and examine outcomes for each application in both countries. The data indicate that Brazil is less likely to grant applications than India, but in both countries, the measures designed to limit secondary patents are having little direct effect. This suggests, on the one hand, that critics of these policies, such as the transnational pharmaceutical sector and foreign governments, may be more worried than they should be. On the other hand, champions of the policies, such as NGOs and international organizations, may have cause for concern that laws on the books are not having the expected impact on patent outcomes in practice. Our findings also suggest that, at the drug level, the effects of countries' approaches towards secondary patents need to be understood in the context of their broader approaches towards Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) implementation, including when and how they introduced pharmaceutical patents in the 1990s and 2000s.",2015,Development Studies; International Relations; Government & Law
Measuring the value of patents with fuzzy multiple criteria decision making: insight into the practices of the Industrial Technology Research Institute,Patent valuation; Multiple criteria decision making; Analytical hierarchy process; Fuzzy; Patent value measurement system; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INDICATORS; STRATEGIES; INNOVATION; SYSTEM; AHP,"This study addresses the construction of a value measurement system for numerous patents across disciplines. We collected dozens of variables through a review of the literature and a survey of a panel of experts. Then we ran a factor analysis to extract 10 independent criteria and we used these to construct a hierarchical structure in which the criteria were categorized into strategic values, commercialization values, and protection values. The weight of each criterion was determined by an analytical hierarchy process survey. Finally, we used a fuzzy survey designed using the 10 criteria to measure the values of a large number of patents and to divide the patent families into three classes. To test the method, we used the 4346 patents of the Industrial Technology Research Institute as an empirical case to illustrate the usefulness of the method. The results indicated that the method is useful not only for assessing the value of numerous types of patent across disciplines but also for probing small differences among similar patents and adjusting the weights of criteria to comply with organizational objectives. We found that 14% of 4346 patents were highly valuable whereas 75% of patents were intermediate value, and 11% were of low value. We discuss managerial insights for each class of patent and limitation of the hybrid model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.",2015,Business & Economics; Public Administration
"Biotechnology patenting caught between Union law and EPC law: European bundle patents, unitary patents and intentional harmonization of decisions in the internal market",biotechnology; patentability requirements; European patent; unitary patent; Directive 98/44; Regulation 1257/2012; harmonization; ,"Although in the European Union (the Union) the substantive rules for the patenting of biotechnological inventions are governed by Directive 98/44, the actual examination and grant of patents in Europe is provided by the European Patent Office (EPO), which is not part of the Union legal order and acts according to a non-Union legal instrument, the European Patent Convention (EPC). This hybrid situation results in legal uncertainty and can lead to partly inconsistent applications of patentability requirements, since the EPO is not bound to Union law and cannot refer questions to the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU). Thus, there is no guarantee that the Union and Unified Patent Court (UPC) judiciaries, on the one hand, and the EPO judiciaries, on the other hand, will come to comparable conclusions regarding the patenting of identical biotechnological subject-matter in the Union, irrespective of whether it concerns a classic European patent or a unitary patent. However, the unitary patent is introduced in the framework of fostering the functioning of the internal market and ensuring undistorted competition, and it provides uniform protection. The CJEU has given a very limited interpretation only to this concept of uniformity, leaving room for inconsistent decisions. Hence, it would appear that only intentional, determined harmonization efforts of the diverse judiciaries involved can increase consistency between decisions of the Union and the non-Union legal systems, although the judiciaries are unrelated. This call for coherency becomes even more pressing with the establishment of the unitary patent. Given this complex situation it may be questioned whether in the Union the law-makers of Directive 98/44 can fully achieve their aim in regulating and harmonizing biotechnology patenting.",2016,Government & Law

Selling patents at auction: an empirical analysis of patent value,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MARKET VALUE; TECHNOLOGY; INDICATORS; CITATIONS; INDUSTRY; OPPOSITION; DYNAMICS; DRIVERS; EUROPE,"This article analyzes the impact of patent bibliographic indicators and patent characteristics on the economic value of patents put on sale in an auction, considering different typologies of sellers and buyers. A unique data set covering all patent auctions held until the end of 2008 by Ocean Tomo is used. We employ two measures of patent value drawn from the auction process: the offer price (ex ante value set by the seller) and the closing price (the market value determined by the buyers) of patent lots. We find a positive correlation between forward citations and the economic value of patents (in terms of both the lot offer price and the lot closing price), while backward citations have a positive and significant impact only on the lot offer price. The number of claims is positively related to the lot closing price and the effect is significant only for the fraction of buyers who are nonpracticing entities. The degree of technological congruence of the patents included in a lot turns out to be positively associated with the probability that the lot is sold and has a positive effect on both the lot offer price and the lot closing price. We also find a significant impact of the extent of the residual life of patents on the lot closing price. The effect is driven by the subsample of nonpracticing entities as buyers. Finally, the extension of patent protection to other jurisdictions, as captured by the size of the patent family, is positively associated with both the lot offer price and the lot closing price.",2015,Business & Economics
Pain-Killer: A 19th Century Global Patent Medicine and the Beginnings of Modern Brand Marketing,marketing history; brand marketing; patent medicines; trademark protection; global marketing; ,"This paper examines the marketing of a so-called patent medicine, Perry Davis' Vegetable Pain-Killer, to suggest that many of its 19th century brand marketing practices were precursors to modern brand marketing tactics. Pain-Killer developed a distinctive brand identity through the creation and protection of several brand elements including the product itself, its name, packaging and advertising. The Pain-Killer brand also offered useful content marketing in terms of almanacs, advertainment consisting of a book of rhymes and pictures relating to Pain-Killer and a brand story centered in part on its inventor and founder Perry Davis. The Pain-Killer brand enjoyed decades of success reportedly selling 100 million bottles in 60 years (Bismarck Daily Tribune 1905). Ultimately, this brand disappeared because Pain-Killer became a generic product category name rather than a brand name and drug criticism and regulation limited its formulation and ability to advertise using cure-all claims.",2019,Business & Economics
Inherent Anticipation in the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industries,; ,"Pharmaceutical and biotech research often involves discovering new properties of, or new methods to use, existing compositions. The doctrine of inherent anticipation, however, prevents the issuance and/or validity of a patent for discoveries deemed to have been implicitly disclosed in the prior art. This can be a barrier to patent rights in these technologies. Inherent anticipation therefore creates uncertainty for patent protection in the pharmaceutical and biotech sciences. Despite this uncertainty, Federal Circuit jurisprudence provides guidance on the boundaries of the inherent anticipation doctrine. In view of the case law, certain strategies may be employed to protect inventions that may potentially be viewed as inherent in the prior art.",2015,Research & Experimental Medicine

An investigation of 80 countries in the years of 1981-2010 shows that international patenting activities vary across countries. We also find that both thigh-tech related international export and inward foreign direct investment significantly contributes to emerging countries' ability to produce cutting-edge technologies, but this effect does not exist for leading innovator countries. Moreover, although this study shows strong intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection is highly correlated with international patenting activities in leading innovator countries, it has a negative impact on emerging innovator countries' national innovative capacity. The findings thus help better understand the role of international economic activities and IPR in enhancing national innovative capacity, and facilitate emerging countries' effort to catch up with leading innovator countries.

FUNCTIONALITY SCREENS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; TRADE DRESS; COPYRIGHT; PATENT; PROTECTION; CREATIVITY; COSTS; INNOVATION; SYSTEMS; NORMS,"Among intellectual property (IP) doctrines, only utility patents should protect function. Utility patents offer strong rights that place constraints on competition, but they only arise when inventors can demonstrate substantial novelty after a costly examination. Copyrights, trademarks, and design patents are much easier to obtain than utility patents, and they often last much longer. Accordingly, to prevent claimants from obtaining backdoor patents, the other IP doctrines must screen out functionality. As yet, however, courts and scholars have paid little systematic attention to the ways in which these functionality screens operate across and within IP law. We have four tasks in this Article. First, we identify three separate functionality screens that IP laws use: Filtering, Exclusion, and Threshold. Second, we illustrate the use of these different screens in copyright, trademark, and design patent laws. Each law takes a different approach to screening functionality. Third, we model the relative costs and benefits of the different screening regimes, paying particular attention to administrative and error costs and how these costs affect incentives and competition. Finally, we assess the current screening regimes and offer suggestions for how they might be improved.",2017,Government & Law
The Roles Of Patents And Research And Development Incentives In Biopharmaceutical Innovation,; PHARMACEUTICALS; COMPETITION; EXCLUSIVITY; MORTALITY; INDUSTRY; DRUGS,"Patents and other forms of intellectual property protection play essential roles in encouraging innovation in biopharmaceuticals. As part of the 21st Century Cures initiative, Congress is reviewing the policy mechanisms designed to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new treatments. Debate continues about how best to balance patent and intellectual property incentives to encourage innovation, on the one hand, and generic utilization and price competition, on the other hand. We review the current framework for accomplishing these dual objectives and the important role of patents and regulatory exclusivity (together, the patent-based system), given the lengthy, costly, and risky biopharmaceutical research and development process. We summarize existing targeted incentives, such as for orphan drugs and neglected diseases, and we consider the pros and cons of proposed voluntary or mandatory alternatives to the patent-based system, such as prizes and government research and development contracting. We conclude that patents and regulatory exclusivity provisions are likely to remain the core approach to providing incentives for biopharmaceutical research and development. However, prizes and other voluntary supplements could play a useful role in addressing unmet needs and gaps in specific circumstances.",2015,Health Care Sciences & Services
Selection of key technology policies for Chinese offshore wind power: A perspective on patent maps,Patent maps; Chinese offshore wind power; Key technology; International Patent Classification; ENERGY; INNOVATION; EUROPE; SYSTEM,"China is rich in offshore wind energy resources and the development of its offshore wind power is considered a practical solution to today's energy requirements. In the field of offshore wind power and, in contrast to more developed countries, China still has a problem with both a weak technical support system and underdeveloped technologies. To shed some light on present day technological advancements in this area, this paper uses the Beijing IncoShare Patent Database as well as patent maps to conduct statistical analyses on the evolution, regional distribution, variation in type and International Patent Classification of patent applications for offshore wind power in China. The research indicates that policies aimed at bolstering technologies were the cause of the observed rapid growth in offshore wind power patents from 2006 to 2013. Regional distribution of these patents is concentrated in Eastern China, with little activity in either Central or Western China. At present, a significant percentage of patents on Chinese offshore wind power have expired, so it is recommended that China both increase its capacity for technical industrialization and reinforce its protection of intellectual property rights. Furthermore, insufficient research on motors, hydraulic engineering and ship propulsion plants is a constraint to technological progress and future policy which aims at improving China's prospects for offshore wind power should focus on these areas.",2018,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations
Identifying patterns in rare earth element patents based on text and data mining,Rare earth elements; Patent; Text mining; Topic detection; Quadratic assignment procedure (QAP); Patent network analysis; Association rule; TECHNOLOGY,"Rare earth elements (REE) are needed to produce many cutting-edge products, and their depletion is a major concern. In this paper, we identify unique characteristics of REE-related patents granted from 1975 to 2013 in five large patent offices around the world. Through topic detection and clustering of patent text, we found that purification processes related to oxides, nitrogen oxide, and exhaust gas were highlighted in the Korean Intellectual Property Office and Japan Patent Office (JPO). Molecular sieve, dispersion, and preparation methods involving yttrium, cerium, methane, zirconium, and ammonia were prominent in the China Patent and Trademark Office (CPTO) in the areas of performing operation and transporting. Quadratic assignment procedure correlation analysis was performed for IPC co-occurrence among REE patents in different offices, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office showed significantly different patterns than the CPTO and JPO. Furthermore, using betweenness centrality as an indicator of technology transition, the manufacture and treatment of nanostructures, nanotechnology for materials and surface science, and electrodes were identified as important REE technologies to be protected in Korea.

"Dispute the patent, short the stock: Empirical analysis of a new hedge fund strategy",Event-study; Stock price effects; Patent oppositions; IPR; AIA; PTAB; ,"A new US patent legislation, called the America Invents Act, became effective in 2011. The reform strived toward facilitating the patent system. But soon it was also blamed for facilitating immoral third party profits. Urges for revision of the America Invents Act became even louder since hedge fund manager Kyle Bass had publicly outlined his questionable investment strategy: he challenges the validity of important drug patents, while shorting the owner's shares in order to eventually cash out on negative stock movements. The following questions aroused public interest the most: Does the mere filing of a patent opposition already result in negative stock returns? And is it really possible to earn money following such a strategy? The paper on hand is the first to empirically answer these questions. Event study methodology using three years of data from the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board was employed. Findings were that the mere filing of a patent opposition in fact produces statistically significant negative returns. The result is robust with the abnormal return being 30 base points. In addition, multiple linear regression results confirm the conjecture that the higher the importance of the disputed patent, the higher the negative abnormal return on the filing date will be. However, transaction cost simulations prove that this strategy is still highly speculative and cannot be considered a real threat to patent holders or the US intellectual property system. The only ones who should start worrying are the few patent owners who really rely on absolutely unjustified and tenuous patent protection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"Firm Patenting, Innovations, and Government Institutional Support as a Double-Edged Sword",; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TECHNOLOGY VENTURES; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PRODUCT; PERFORMANCE; CHINA; INDICATORS; BUSINESS; STRATEGY; ORGANIZATIONS,"In 2012, China was ranked fourth in patent filing by region of origin. However, firm innovation quality is not comparable to such quantity. Evidence of this is that no Chinese organization was named as a Thomson Reuters 2011 or 2012 Top 100 Global Innovators. This paradox of firm patenting and innovations in China challenges the traditional understanding of the role of government in industrial innovation. This paper provides a theoretical lens through which to examine traditional protective and strategic patenting motives. Based on institutional theory and the ultimate goals of patenting motives, the paper posits that protective patenting motives are directly law-based while strategic patenting motives are largely law-derived. The paper also aims to empirically examine three questions: (1) What is the relative importance of various patenting motives to firm patenting behaviors? (2) What effects do patenting behaviors have on firm product and process innovations? (3) How, if at all, does governmental institutional support affect firm patenting and innovations? This paper uses dominant analysis, structural equation modeling, and regression analysis to analyze the survey data collected from a sample of 270 firms in China. The empirical results provide new evidence about firm patenting, innovations, and government institutional support. First, the order of relative importance of patenting motives to patenting behaviors was found to be (in the descending order of importance) reputation, exchange, blocking, and protection. Second, patenting behaviors were more relevant to product innovations than to process innovations. Third, more importantly, while government institutional support can enhance the effects of protective patenting motives on patenting behaviors, it can mitigate the effects of strategic patenting motives on patenting behaviors. Moreover, government institutional support reduces the positive effect of patenting behaviors on product innovations. These findings suggest that firm patenting and innovations are distinct activities, and that government institutional support acts as a double-edged sword in firm patenting and innovations: On the one hand government institutional supportan extralegal formal institutionmay work alongside the patent systema law-based formal institutionto advance science and technology, but on the other hand government institutional support may distract firms from commercializing patented knowledge into new products. This paper primarily contributes to institutional theory, new product development literature, and innovation management practice by revealing the dynamics between two different types of formal institutionspatent system and government institutional supportby establishing an institution-based view of patenting motives, by empirically distinguishing firm patenting and innovations, and more interestingly by uncovering a double-edged role of government institutional support in firm patenting and innovations.",2015,Business & Economics; Engineering

Reform and development with respect to patent rights and enforcement nevertheless have become an important area to attract foreign investment. Over time, the country has realized that the utilitarian nature of this private right suits its development needs and it now fully embraces the concept. Patent law has become one of the main targets of the government in its attempt to establish a modern legal system. It has also become a symbol of the country's technological advancement. Patent rules in China are now very similar to those of its Western counterparts. The enforcement mechanism has been reformed with a view to enhancing patent rights. The administrative remedy of patent infringement is a unique feature in China's patent enforcement system, which has its drawbacks. By contrast, the establishment of Intellectual Property Courts is a clear sign of the development of a more autonomous, independent, and professional judiciary in the area of patent law. The most watched area with regard to the patent system at this moment is the government's application of antitrust law in the patent licensing practices, especially in the field of standard and essential patents (SEPs). The trend of the cases in this field suggests that China is very active in enforcing its antitrust laws. On the one hand, China is enhancing the protection of patent rights when domestic patent holders are gaining ground in terms of the quality of their patents. On the other hand, China is using its antitrust law to limit the power of foreign SEP holders. From this perspective, the Chinese government is using antitrust laws to achieve what it cannot do by patent law. Under the TRIPS Agreement, there is no room for discriminatory treatment in patent law. Through the aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws, however, the Chinese authorities can limit the patent rights of foreign holders while at the same time empowering domestic patentees. Legal rules in China in the field of patent law are an interesting case study. China accepted patent law from the West and also created many unique responses along the way. Many of these unique responses fulfilled their temporal missions and gradually became less important. Now China is using another Western legal concept, antitrust law, to create the optimal patent law environment for its needs.",2016,Area Studies; Government & Law
Exploring technological resilience at the country level with patents,Technological resilience; technological crisis; patent; KNOWLEDGE NETWORKS; COLLABORATION; INNOVATION; SCIENCE; SYSTEMS; SIZE; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; CAPACITY,"Resilience is critical to stabilise and reduce shocks and create advantages over competitors in environments with dramatic change and unexpected crises. There is no generally agreed-upon definition of technological resilience, and there is not yet a well-developed theory of technological resilience at the country level. The objective of this paper is to contribute to technological resilience research based on patent indicators by analyzing OECD countries' technological resilience. This paper provides a framework to analyze the quality of selected patent indicators used for estimating technological crisis. More specifically, four sets of patent indicators, i.e. collaboration, knowledge, diversity, and legal protection, are employed to evaluate technological resilience, which is characterised as crisis probability, intensity, and duration. We found that higher technological coverage leads to higher crisis probability, more original technology leads to higher crisis intensity, and interpersonal collaboration enhances the chance of passing a crisis.",2018,Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics

THE UNEASY CASE FOR PATENT LAW,; FECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION; CLOSTRIDIUM-DIFFICILE INFECTION; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NORMS; INNOVATION; BURDEN; INCREASE; IMPACT; DRUGS; FIRMS,"A central tenet of patent law scholarship holds that if any scientific field truly needs patents to stimulate progress, it is pharmaceuticals. Patents are thought to be critical in encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize new therapies, due to the high costs of researching diseases, developing treatments, and bringing drugs through the complex, expensive approval process. Scholars and policymakers often point to patent law's apparent success in the pharmaceutical industry to justify broader calls for more expansive patent rights. This Article challenges this conventional wisdom about the centrality of patents to drug development by presenting a case study of the role of patents in the emerging field of microbiome research. Scientists have recently begun to appreciate the important role played by the human microbiome, the community of microbes that lives within each of our bodies, in preventing and treating disease. The microbiome has been linked to autoimmune disorders, mental health conditions, and a range of conditions affecting our intestinal systems. Put simply, research involving the microbiome has the potential to change the future of medicine. There's just one problem: the microbiome can't meaningfully be patented. Several doctrines within patent law will make it extremely difficult for companies to obtain and enforce patents like the ones that are so readily available in most areas of medicine. Drawing on patent doctrine, patent searches, and interviews with scientists and lawyers, this Article demonstrates that companies are developing microbiome-based therapies largely in the absence of patent protection. Instead, the companies are relying on other innovation incentives to fill the gap. The microbiome's unpatentability presents an opportunity to evaluate whether patents are truly necessary for the development of new drugs. Congress, the NIH, and the FDA have implemented many innovation incentives throughout the development process, and we should not be astonished that removing a single such incentive, patent law, does not disrupt the entire system. Perhaps scholars should reconsider, if only selectively, our focus on patents as an irreplaceable driver of pharmaceutical innovation.",2018,Government & Law
Could patents interfere with the development of a cardiovascular polypill?,; FIXED-DOSE COMBINATIONS; MIDDLE-INCOME; DISEASE; PREVENTION; MEDICINES; ACCESS; REDUCE,"Background: The Wellcome Trust, the World Health Organization, and cardiologists have advocated for the idea of a polypill containing multiple cardiovascular drugs to be co-formulated into a single pill for over a decade. Some cardiologists have asserted that the drugs commonly considered for inclusion into such a polypill are older and therefore free of patent protection. We tested this assertion. This project was requested by the World Heart Federation ( WHF). Methods, data and materials: Two cardiologists from the WHF provided a list of 48 cardiovascular drugs for evaluation. We designated the United States and Canada as the base jurisdictions for this patent study. We linked patent data from these countries' national medicine patent registers to patent information in over 96 other countries using Derwent and INPADOC via Thomson Innovation. We expanded our study beyond the aforementioned data linkage through a systematic search of the World Intellectual Property Organization's PatentScope, which was based primarily upon the drugs' active ingredient names. Results: In the United States and Canada, eight of the drugs were only available in the patent-protected, brand name formulation in one or both countries. Another 21 drugs had relevant patents, but generic equivalents were nevertheless available. Only 19 drugs (40 %) appeared entirely post-patent. Broadening the co-formulation searches globally, the overwhelming majority of drugs (40/48) were mentioned in patent applications for cardiovascular drug combinations. Conclusion: The assertion that most of these cardiovascular drugs are post-patent is accurate, but only in the sense that many of the original patents on these active ingredients have expired and that generic alternatives are usually available. The landscape of patents covering novel (co-) formulations is far more complex, however. Most research and development for cardiovascular combination medicines are likely to be undertaken by companies whose original patents on the active ingredient will soon expire or have recently expired. Cardiologists looking to accelerate polypill development may consider approaching such companies to partner.",2016,Research & Experimental Medicine
A cross-country index of intellectual property rights in pharmaceutical inventions,Patent; Index; Pharmaceuticals; Intellectual property; TRIPS; PATENTS; COSTS; TECHNOLOGY; PROTECTION,"Building on the seminal work of Ginarte and Park (1997. Research Policy. 26,283-301), we develop an index of property rights in pharmaceutical inventions, the Pharmaceutical Intellectual Property Protection (PIPP) Index, for 154 countries spanning 1960 to 2005. It incorporates five types of property rights in pharmaceuticals; six statutory measures of enforcement; and adherence to three international agreements providing for the grant and enforcement of rights to foreigners. For both developed and developed countries, the PIPP Index starts at low levels in 1960, increases slowly through the early 1990s, and then sharply increases due to minimum standards set by the 1995 TRIPS Agreement.

Effects of intellectual property rights and patented knowledge in innovation and industry value added: A multinational empirical analysis of different industries,Intellectual property rights; Patent; R&D; Sequential innovation; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PROTECTION; INVESTMENT; MECHANISMS; TRANSITION; IMITATION; COUNTRIES; DIVISION; INCREASE,"Technological innovation drives long-term economic growth, so most countries attempt to provide an innovation-friendly environment that includes tightening protection of intellectual property rights (IPR). However, debate continues on whether strengthened IPR lead to technological development and economic growth: patents promote innovation by protecting appropriation from invention and disclosing knowledge to the public, but they also create excessive monopoly power that may impede further innovation. Using simultaneous equations with cross-country panel data from 12 countries and 3 industries (chemical, electronic, machinery), we estimated the direct effect of IPR on industry value added and the indirect effect of it through enhanced research and development (R&D). The bilateral role of IPR, as measured by patented knowledge, was used to distinguish different characteristics of industries as well as the positive and negative effects of IPR on innovation. Results suggest that IPR generally enhance industry value added, but the positive effect is mitigated with increased enforcement of IPR. Also, IPR enhanced R&D but showed a negative relationship with patented knowledge, suggesting that excessive propertization of knowledge may hinder sequential innovation. The positive role of IPR on R&D predominated in the chemical (discrete) industry and exerted negative effects in the electronic and machinery (complex) industries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Secrets for Sale? Innovation and the Nature of Knowledge in an Early Industrial District: The Potteries, 1750-1851",; PATENTS; INVENTION; REVOLUTION,"This article investigates innovation and knowledge circulation in the North Staffordshire Potteries during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It evaluates new empirical evidence of formal and informal patterns of knowledge creation and dissemination in order to highlight tensions between forms of open knowledge sharing and the private appropriation of returns to innovative activity. By presenting new patent data, it shows that formal protection was not a widespread strategy in the industry. It uses patent specifications to determine what types of knowledge were, and could be, patented in the district, and by whom. A range of sources are used to demonstrate evidence of innovation and knowledge appropriation outside of the patent system. The article identifies distinct types of knowledge in the industry and shows how differences in these led to a range of strategies employed by potters, with the role of secrecy highlighted as a particularly prevalent and effective strategy.",2019,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics
The consumer welfare implications of governmental policies and firm strategy in markets for medicines,Intellectual property; Differential pricing; Compulsory licensing; Pharmaceutical demand estimation; Indian pharmaceutical market; DISCRETE-CHOICE MODELS; EUROPEAN CAR MARKET; PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; PRICE CONTROLS; POLITICAL PRESSURE; PATENT PROTECTION; ENTRY; ACCESS; DRUGS; TRIPS,"This paper empirically examines the consumer welfare implications of changes in government policies related to patent protection and compulsory licensing in the Indian market for oral anti-diabetic (OAD) medicines. In contrast to previous studies on the impact of pharmaceutical patents in India, we observe, and estimate the welfare effects accruing from differential pricing and voluntary licensing strategies of patent-holding innovator firms. Three novel molecules belonging to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class of OADs have been launched in India by the patent holders, at lower prices than those prevailing in the developed countries. Using aggregate market transaction data, we structurally estimate demand and supply and use the parameter estimates in our model to simulate consumer welfare under various counterfactual scenarios. Our results suggest that the introduction of DPP-4 inhibitors generated a consumer surplus gain of around 7.6 cents per day for a typical DPP-4 inhibitor user under the existing differential pricing and voluntary licensing strategies. If the innovators decide to price at developed-country levels, this surplus is eliminated almost entirely. The issuance of compulsory licensing does not always improve consumer welfare because if innovators defer or delay the introduction of new drugs in response, the loss in consumer welfare could be substantial.

Decomposition analysis of sustainable green technology inventions in China,Sustainable green technology; Patent data; Decomposition analysis; China; ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY; ENERGY; INNOVATION; JAPAN,"Sustainable green technology is an important contributor to creating a sustainable society by simultaneously promoting environmental protection and economic development. This study examines the determinants of sustainable green technology invention in China, with a focus on the differences in green technology development priorities in each five-year plan period. This study uses patent publication data in a patent decomposition analysis framework. We find that sustainable green patent publications increased due to efficiency improvements, the prioritization of sustainable green patents, an increased R&D expenditure share and economic growth, especially during periods of gradual economic development in China. Additionally, we find that the relative priority of R&D shifted from renewable energy technology to pollution abatement and other sustainable green technology in the 12th five-year plan. The different R&D priority trends for sustainable green technologies among the five-year plans can be used to formulate effective policies that promote sustainable green technology invention.",2019,Business & Economics; Public Administration
TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,traditional knowledge; intellectual property rights; patent; copyright; TRIPS; ,"This paper is devoted to the analysis of possible options to ensure the protection of traditional knowledge through existing laws and legal systems in the field of intellectual property. For this purpose, the common problems that indigenous peoples and local communities face, when trying to ensure the protection of their traditional knowledge with the help of intellectual property law tools, are addressed. Separately, the possibility of using copyright, patents, industrial designs, trademarks, geographical indications, legislation on trade secrets and unfair competition are analyzed in detail. Examples are given for the implementation of traditional knowledge protection through intellectual property rights at the national level in selected countries, such as Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Ethiopia. Considerable attention is paid to the interpretation of the provisions of existing international legal acts in the field of intellectual property, in particular, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), as well as the Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. It is concluded that traditional intellectual property regimes do not provide adequate protection for traditional knowledge since contractual intellectual property rights are based on the concepts of an individual property.",2019,Social Sciences - Other Topics

We use official data on international technology contracts with patent licensing terms registered by affiliated and unaffiliated parties before the Department of Technology Transfer of the National Institute of Intellectual Property (INPI) in Brazil between 1996 and 2012. We find that contracts between unaffiliated parties involving know-how transfer show distinctive contractual and technology features compared to the rest: (i) they involve younger but lower quality technologies (compared to contracts without know-how); (ii) they are more prone to up front lump-sum payments than royalty or combined payments (royalty and fixed); and (iii) they are more likely to be accompanied by the licensing of other IPRs, in addition to patents, such as trademarks.",2017,Business & Economics
Patents and the Global Diffusion of New Drugs,; PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; MARKET-SIZE; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; RIGHTS,"Analysis of the timing of launches of 642 new drugs in 76 countries during 1983-2002 shows that patent and price regulation regimes strongly affect how quickly new drugs become commercially available in different countries. Price regulation delays launch, while longer and more extensive patent rights accelerate it. Health policy institutions and economic and demographic factors that make markets more profitable also speed up diffusion. The estimated effects are generally robust to controlling for endogeneity of policy regimes with country fixed effects and instrumental variables. The results highlight the important role of policy choices in driving the diffusion of new innovations.",2016,Business & Economics

We use a variety-expansion model with R&D in North and South, and with Southern imitation targeted at both foreign and domestic innovations. In the short-run of Northern economy, NT can never dominate discrimination in the sense of generating a higher world welfare, and it tends to be dominated by discrimination. In the long-run of Northern economy, we obtain three results. First, under free trade, NT is favorable to the North while discrimination is favorable to the South. Second, if the entry cost of Northern R&D market is high and the strength of protection for Northern innovation under discrimination is not that weak, then NT is strictly dominated by discrimination, no matter whether trade barriers exist or not. Third, if trade barriers are sufficiently large, then NT dominates discrimination only when the strength of protection for Northern innovation under discrimination is weak; otherwise, NT is strictly dominated by discrimination.",2019,Business & Economics
Intellectual Property Rights and the productivity effects of MNE affiliates on host-country firms,Intellectual Property Rights; Multinationals; Knowledge spillovers; Competition effects; Pecuniary externalities; FDI; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT RIGHTS; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; DOMESTIC FIRMS; LOCAL-PARTICIPATION; 2 FACES; SPILLOVERS; PROTECTION; MULTINATIONALS,"In this paper we investigate the impact of increased Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection on the productivity effects that MNE affiliates exert on local host-country firms. Conceptually, we argue that IPR protection has two opposing effects: On the one hand, it weakens the productivity effects through reduced knowledge spillovers and increased monopoly power of MNE affiliates. On the other hand, it strengthens productivity effects through increased knowledge sharing (with local suppliers) and higher quality products and processes produced and used by MNE affiliates. Given these opposing forces, the net outcome is an empirical matter. Using a sample of 81,299 local firms in 17 countries, we find that increased IPR protection strengthens backward (to supplier) productivity effects and weakens forward (to customer) productivity effects. These moderating effects of IPR protection are only observed in industries that strongly rely on patents to protect intellectual property. The results suggest that increased IPR protection leads to increased knowledge sharing with local suppliers, yet also to increased monopoly power over local (corporate) customers.

I find that while software patent stocks positively affect the relationship between a firm's OSS product portfolio and its value, software trademark stocks have a negative effect on this relationship.",2015,Business & Economics
Global norm of national treatment for patent uncertainties: A longitudinal comparison between the US and China,Global norm; National treatment; Patent pendency; Patent system; Patent granting; Patent uncertainty; Institutions; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; INSTITUTIONS; MARKET; TRADE; MULTILATERALISM; PROTECTION; AGREEMENTS; INVENTION; PRODUCT; OFFICE,"Sporadic studies on the global norm of national treatment for patent uncertainties (NTPU) urge for insights of changes as well as for clarification to discrepancy. This global norm has been a concern for policy makers and practitioners for over a century; as a socially and strategically more significant matter than before for multilateral cooperation given the active technology transfer across borders. To fill in the void and extend prior studies, we examine the global compliance of NTPU from the perspective of patent pendency and granting by addressing three relevant questions: (1) Is NTPU upheld within countries? (2) How does NTPU diverge across countries? (3) How does NTPU change, as an outcome, over time? Based on the institutional theory, lagged regression modeling and longitudinal comparison of US and Chinese patenting, our findings reveal that: (1) NTPU is overall upheld because equality in pendency is demonstrated in both countries and in US granting, and foreigners are even favored for Chinese granting. (2) NTPU is comparatively divergent between the countries in pendency and granting due to national variations. (3) Regressive and progressive changes in NTPU are evidenced since both countries provide equal or higher granting, but longer pendency than before. Our findings contribute to theories by providing new insights to the global norm of national treatment and institutional theory from the perspective of patent uncertainties. We make novel empirical contribution to address NTPU changes of the top patent filing countries and methodological contribution to the longitudinal comparative study. The results also provide implications that concern policy makers and practitioners to handle patent uncertainties across borders.",2018,Business & Economics
A new method for extracting knowledge from patents to inspire designers during the problem-solving phase,Innovation; patents; keyword-based; energy-based; problem-solving; TECHNOLOGY; TRIZ; TRENDS,"Nowadays, patents are more than an industrial property protection, they constitute a considerable source of information. Several approaches deal with the extraction of pertinent information from patents, some of them translate that information into useful knowledge for problem-solving purposes. However, very few methods use a physical approach and a consistent analysis of the main function in the problem definition phase. This paper proposes a new method to inspire designers with ideas and analogous solutions. The objective is to contribute to solve complex technical problems by exploiting knowledge found in patent documents. The method is divided into three sections: problem definition, research and analysis, and innovation. The first two sections use iteratively a knowledge base formed by pertinent keywords related to the problem context, physical keywords from functional decomposition and physical analysis, and technological keywords recovered through patent analysis. In the third section, interesting patents are classified in a structured discovery matrix from the physical phenomena involved which are crossed in accordance with the related techniques found. The method is supported by a physical effects database of energy conversion and by evolution trends of technical systems. A deep offshore biphasic separator illustrates the method.",2017,Engineering
Between pharmaceutical patents and European patients: is a compromise still possible?,European Union; market protection; patenting; pharmaceuticals; ,"Introduction: Pharmaceutical regulation has always attempted to balance the public health objective to make safe and effective drugs available for patients while providing commercial incentives through patents. Here we discuss whether it is still possible to find a balance between the incentives on the supply side and the regulatory framework on the demand side. Areas covered: The current regulatory framework on pharmaceutical exclusivity has been harshly criticized by many experts, arguing about whether it is still fit for public purposes and needs. Here we envisage a different scenario without 'revolutionizing' the whole present system. The main radical change should concern the present management of pharmaceutical patents by introducing a specific agency dedicated to them. Secondly, specific pharmaceutical patents could be restricted to compounds for one (or more) declared indication(s). Thirdly, pharmaceutical patents should be kept only for compounds that start a first clinical trial within five years from the granting date. Expert opinion: We think it is time to reconsider the regulation of pharmaceutical patents in the light of their relevance in terms of public health. New models of enhancing research investments are required for long-term sustainability of public pharmaceutical expenditure and the EU can still play a leading role",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

A hedonic pricing model was adapted to the characteristics of the U.S. wholesale ornamental plant market, specifically the bedding, garden plant and nursery plant markets, to analyze two forms of IP rights used on plants (i.e., plant patents and trademarks). By controlling plant-specific attributes and a variety of market variables that might affect plant values, our empirical analysis reveals sizable price premiums for plant patents that may have been masked in other studies. As expected, plant patent premiums vary considerably between species where the costs of producing and marketing new cultivars differ greatly. Surprisingly, we find that the use of trademarks have a negative effect on plant prices.",2015,Agriculture

We further observed a short-term profit-enhancing effect of a firm obtaining a patent after controlling for firm heterogeneity and the endogeneity problem. Our results indicate that firms that invested in research and development successfully obtained patents, and the protection granted by government-issued patents improved their profitability. These findings have strong policy-related implications; innovation policymakers in the government should ensure a favourable industrial environment that focuses on giving firms incentives to improve performance.",2019,Business & Economics

Collection and Remanufacturing of Waste Products under Patent Protection and Government Regulation,patent protection; reward-penalty policy; remanufacturing; closed-loop supply chain (CLSC); waste collection; LOOP SUPPLY CHAIN; STRATEGY,"There is increasing academic and pragmatic interest in leveraging patent rights to invigorate remanufacturing for waste products under governmental interventions via regulations and reward-penalty instruments. In practice, many original manufacturers that are possessed with intellectual property rights allow third-party remanufacturers to implement reproducing operations through authorization and charging licensing fees. The general purpose of this paper is to explore favorable strategies for a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) system of waste product collection and remanufacturing, in the context of either manufacturer-remanufacturing or remanufacturer-remanufacturing. To achieve such an objective, game theory is adopted to establish models of three collection and remanufacturing modes among channel members involving a manufacturer, a seller, and a remanufacturer. In so doing, the results show that a government's allocations of elementary remanufacturing ratio and the unit amount of reward-penalty count significantly in CLSC operations, especially for the manufacturer, who acts as the leader in the system and makes mode selections.",2018,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology
Relationship between intellectual property and economic competitiveness,Competitiveness; Intellectual property; Relative Specialization Index (RSI); Innovation; Patents; Universities; RIGHTS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; GROWTH; IMPACT,"Various economic theories indicate that many factors determine the competitive position of national economies. In addition to classical factors such as natural resources, technology, and capital (including human capital), other elements include openness and readiness to generate and implement innovation. An important role is played by institutional and legal systems, which provide economic liberty, free competition, and protection against monopolies, corruption, and crime. According to some research, an important role is also played by issues related to intellectual property (and more precisely, industrial property). The purpose of this article is to verify the importance of intellectual property on economic development. For this purpose, literary studies and patent research were primarily used, including an analysis of the relative specialization index (RSI). The analysis results indicated that the effect of IPP on GNP was not explicit and, depending on the starting position of an economy, and an increase in IPP outlays may have various effects. Another important finding is the extraordinarily dynamic growth of the Chinese economy, as measured by patent indices.",2019,Engineering

"Model of corporate intelligence, secrecy, and economic growth",R&D; information leakage; secrecy; informal IPR; innovation-based growth; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; PATENT PROTECTION; INNOVATION; IMITATION,"This paper plugs informal intellectual property rights (IPR) and secrecy into a scale-invariant Schumpeterian model of growth. In doing so, the paper envisages the existence of two-stage research and development races in which firms initially introduce a new way to produce new quality products, and then try to refine it in order to make the innovation suitable for patent application. In the passage from the first stage to the second, research firms keep the discovery secret, but face a positive probability that some sensitive information can leak from the firm because of corporate intelligence. The model displays a unique steady state, which is then used to study the long-run effects of strengthening secrecy protection. Stronger secrecy protection is found to be welfare-improving and beneficial for innovation and growth, even in the case where research firms can prevent corporate-intelligence firms from obtaining sensitive information through information-protecting activities.",2015,Business & Economics
Intellectual property rights reform and the cost of corporate debt,Intellectual property rights; Bank loans; PATENT PROTECTION; CREDITOR RIGHTS; LAWS; INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS; MARKET; LIFE,"This paper investigates the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection on the cost of bank loans for firms in 48 countries. Using substantial reforms of patent rights as a source of identifying variation, the paper provides strong evidence that borrowers from countries that underwent IPR reform experience significant reductions in the cost of bank debt. Importantly, the effects of IPR reform on loan rates are significantly larger in industries that are more IP-intensive. Additional analysis shows that in the wake of reforms borrowers obtain larger size loans, which indicates that improvements in IPR are associated with greater credit availability. IPR reform also increases foreign lenders participation in loan syndicates. Overall, these findings suggest that legal protection afforded to intellectual property has a significant impact on the cost of corporate borrowing and the ability of innovative firms to raise debt capital.

THE PROMISING VIRAL THREAT TO BACTERIAL RESISTANCE: THE UNCERTAIN PATENTABILITY OF PHAGE THERAPEUTICS AND THE NECESSITY OF ALTERNATIVE INCENTIVES,; BACTERIOPHAGE; THERAPY,"Bacteriophages, or phages, are a category of highly adept and adaptable viruses that can infect and kill bacteria. With concerns over the burgeoning antibiotic-resistance crisis looming in recent years, scientists and policymakers have expressed a growing interest in developing novel treatments for bacterial infections that utilize bacteriophages. Because of the great expense associated with bringing a new drug to market, patents are usually considered the gold standard for incentivizing research and development in the pharmaceutical field. Absent such strong protection for a developer's front end investment, pharmaceutical development remains financially risky and unattractive. Unfortunately, recent Supreme Court jurisprudence analyzing patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101 has cast doubt on whether phage therapeutics would be eligible for strong patent protection.

"Constructing a Chinese Patent Database of listed firms in China: Descriptions, lessons, and insights",; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; OFFICE; SURGE,"Although China is now the largest patent filing country in the world, there is little firm-level research using Chinese patents due to difficulties in integrating Chinese patent data with firm data. To partially address this gap, we construct a Chinese Patent Database linking State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) patents to all listed firms and their subsidiaries in China, and we are making the database publicly available to the research community. We first develop a computer program to match the assignee names of SIPO patents to the names of listed firms and subsidiaries based on a similarity score, taking into account unique challenges associated with Chinese firm-names and Chinese characters. High-scoring likely matches are then checked manually to determine whether they are indeed true matches. The resulting database includes 191,325 SIPO patents matched to listed firms in China from 1990 to 2010. Using this database, we find a large amount of patenting heterogeneity across firms of different geographic locations, technological foci, and ownership types. We also leverage strengths of the data to conduct a detailed analysis of the patent examination process at the SIPO. Although there is not much difference in the examination process between listed firms and their nonlisted counterparts in China, substantial differences exist between Chinese firms and foreign firms. We find that foreign firms experience substantial delay in publishing patent applications and requesting for substantive examination compared to Chinese firms. Such delay accounts for 40-60% of the longer duration from application date to decision date for foreign firms. However, after accounting for such delay, foreign firms still face much longer pendency in reaching an examination outcome (grant, withdrawal, or refusal) than Chinese firms. We hope that the public database and such analysis will encourage new streams of research on Chinese patents to improve our knowledge of China's fast-changing innovation landscape.",2018,Business & Economics
"ANALYSIS OF PATENT ACTIVITY IN RE KAVETSKY INSTITUTE OF EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY, ONCOLOGY AND RADIOBIOLOGY OF THE NAS OF UKRAINE",patent activity; objects of intellectual property rights; invention activity; innovative potential; information support; and experimental oncology; ,"Introduction. The effectiveness of innovation activities of R&D oncology institutions is determined by the level of legal protection of intellectual property and affects the degree of implementation of research results in health care practice. Problem Statement. Combatting cancer is one of the most important medical and social problems of our time and progress in solving it can be achieved through the use of fundamental knowledge as a significant source of innovation. Purpose. To assess the status of patent and inventory activities of the RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (IEPOR) in terms of the formation of strategic management decisions concerning its optimization. Materials and Methods. The main quantitative indicators of patent and invention of the IEPOR for 2009-2017, in particular, the number of applications and the number of patents issued; the index of patents of various types (for inventions, utility models, industrial designs) obtained; and rating of patent activities by the IEPOR departments have been evaluated. On the basis of the quantitative analysis and analysis of the international patent classification (IPC) of IPR objects, the orientation of the IPR objects by themes and subjects has been studied. Results. The peaks of patent activities were reported for 2010 (13 objects of IPR), 2013 (17 objects of IPR), and 2016 (12 objects of IPR). Data analysis for 2009-2017 on the received patent documents of various types has shown the priority of declarative patents for utility model. The patenting rating for 2009-2017 by the IEPOR research departments shows a different level of patent activities of researchers. A characteristic feature of the development of patent and invention of researchers is the thematic orientation of the objects of IPs in full accordance with the main directions of the research work of the institute. Conclusions. The indicators of patent activities show a high level of the scholarly research activities and innovative potential of the institute and are an informative basis for the formation of strategic management decisions regarding the optimization of patent and invention activities.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics
Utility model patent regime strength and technological development: Experiences of China and other East Asian latecomers,Utility model patents; Utility model patent regime strength; Utility model patent regime strictness and appropriability-strength; China; East Asian latecomers; Catch-up strategy; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; IMPACTS; INDEX,"This paper analyzes how strategic calibration of utility model patent regimes - which provide a type of patent right that is distinct from invention patents and is far less studied in the literature - over time is intended to facilitate technological development. To do this, the paper develops what appear to be the first indexes of utility model patent regime strength (divided into strictness and appropriability indexes), which it tabulates for mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan per every year from the time of inception of their laws governing utility models (the first of which was in 1905) till 2016. It then analyzes these indexes via fixed effects regressions and case studies. The results show that East Asian latecomers instituted utility model patent regimes that were less strict and offered less appropriability during earlier stages of economic catch-up, likely in order to facilitate technological learning. Subsequently, the strictness of the regimes was increased as knowledge accumulation and, to some extent, technological capabilities increased and, in mainland China's case especially, as patent quality problems were experienced. It is also found that increasing the strictness of utility model patent regimes may reduce patenting in the short-term, but not the long-term. Six propositions are formulated, including the overall conclusion that successful latecomers seem to have pursued a dynamic catch-up strategy of transitioning from imitative to more sophisticated technological development by increasing both the strictness and appropriability-strength of their utility model patent regimes in conjunction with increasing knowledge accumulation and, to some extent, technological capabilities. It is suggested that mainland China might benefit from further increasing the strictness of its utility model patent regime in the future. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Pathways of Innovation: The I-District Effect Revisited,Industrial districts; I-district effect; Technological innovation; Patents; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS,"The I-district effect establishes the existence of dynamic efficiency in Marshallian industrial districts in the form of a positive innovative differential comparing to the average of the economy. The hypothesis has been empirically validated for the case of technological innovation using patent indicators. Empirical research has assumed that all types of patentable figures (utility models, national patents, EPO, WIPO) have the same weight regardless of its actual or expected market value, which may be questionable given the differences in coverage, protection and cost of each figure. In this article, we question the existence of the I-district effect when each patent is weighted by its expected potential value. As the I-district effect theory predicts, the relative differential effect is maintained even in the presence of the weighting, rejecting that the industrial district specializes only in low-quality patents. However, in this case, the primacy of industrial district as the most innovative local production system can be outpaced by other local production systems.",2018,Business & Economics; Geography

Using both static pooled regressions and a dynamic panel GMM estimator on a panel data of 53 countries, we examine whether stronger foreign IPR protection stimulates US international transactions.

PATENT EXPERIMENTALISM,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; EXPERIMENTAL TESTS; CONTROLLED-TRIALS; EX ANTE; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; POLICY; LAW,"MANY scholars have wrestled with what I call the first-order question in patent law: What policies should we adopt to promote innovation? This Article grapples with the second-order question: What policies should we adopt to promote innovation about promoting innovation? I argue that empirical progress in patent law depends on greater policy diversity (rather than the current emphasis on uniformity), but unconstrained laboratories of experimentation are suboptimal due to the spillovers from local policies. Instead, patent policy makers should adopt a third way between uniformity and local control: centralized promotion of policy variation. The optimal approach to such policy experimentation depends on the context. Randomized policy experiments should be used more often, both in the field (for example, testing prizes in a random selection of pharmaceutical classes) and in the lab (for example, testing how varying disclosure affects performance in implementing software patents). But many nuanced, dynamic issues such as the patent-eligibility of new technologies in heterogeneous jurisdictions are better approached not through fixed experiments, but rather through an adaptive experimentalist governance regime. Local actors patent examiners, judges, or even individual countries should be granted broad discretion to meet centrally defined framework goals, with the requirement of defending their decisions through robust peer review. Even where controlled experiments are infeasible, experimentalist policies could elicit local knowledge, generate varied observational data, and encourage more robust theory development about the mechanisms by which innovation policies work This pluralistic, evidence-based approach to patent policy can be guided by recent trends in personalized and evidence-based medicine, and the resulting framework for legal experimentation has implications for policy learning beyond patent law.",2015,Government & Law

It focuses on Chile-based inventors who pursued intellectual-property protection in solar, tidal, wave motion, water flow, and wind power. The backgrounds and careers of these inventors are examined. The case contests the popular assumption that knowledge always originated in the developed North and flowed southward. Instead, at least in the case of renewable energy, knowledge emerged endogenously in Chile and sometimes even flowed northward. This research note argues that the circulation of knowledge was strongly linked to the mobility of individuals rather than to the mobility of patents between North and South.",2019,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics

Eurasian patent No. EA 001809 includes substitution of the correct chemical name of the patented substances with an erroneous synonym, and the statement of claim, along with lack of novelty of the data on the properties of the patented substances, includes contradictory and unreliable information irrelevant to the item subject to the patent. This approach to prolonging the period of legal protection of a substance used as an APS is not acceptable either from the scientific or from the ethical points of view. Our x-ray diffraction study of abacavir sulfate (USP RS) showed that this substance and abacavir hemisulfate are identical, on the basis of published data on the structure of abacavir hemisulfate crystals. Each of these substances is a neutral salt and each has the atomic formula (C14H19N6O)(2)SO4 and a molecular weight of 670.76. Thus, repatenting a known APS (i.e., abacavir sulfate) as a new substance under a name incorrect for a neutral salt, i.e., (1S,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]cyclopent-2-en-1-methanol hemisulfate, is unjustified.",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy
Printing spare parts through additive manufacturing: legal and digital business challenges,Additive manufacturing; Strategic management; Service operations; Spare parts; Patent law; Digital businesses; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; CRITICALITY,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the technology, business and intellectual property issues surrounding the production of spare parts through additive manufacturing (AM) from a digital source. It aims to identify challenges to the growth of the AM spares market and propose suitable solutions. Design/methodology/approach The paper begins with a systematic literature review and theoretical analysis. This is followed by case study research through semi-structured interviews, forming the basis of a triangulated, cross-case analysis of empirical data. Findings The paper identifies several obstacles to the development of the AM-produced digital spares market. The manufacturing industry will soon be forced to re-think AM as a real manufacturing alternative. Short-term, AM technology has implications for the production of components for legacy systems for which tooling facilities no longer exist. Long-term, AM will be used to produce a wide range of components especially when product and/or service functionality can be increased. To enable companies to navigate current uncertainties in the patent framework (especially the repair vs make doctrine), new intellectual property rights strategies could be developed around patenting both complex devices and their individual components, and seeking patent protection for CAD files. Further harmonization of the EU legal framework, the interpretation of claims and the scope of protection offered in the context of spare parts, will also be important. Originality/value This study pinpoints key issues that need to be addressed within the European AM business environment and the patent system and proposes recommendations for business and legal frameworks to promote the growth of a stable European digital spare parts market.",2018,Engineering; Business & Economics

"Parallel imports, price controls, and innovation",Pharmaceutical innovation; Parallel imports; Price regulation; Research & Development; Patent length; TRADE; DEMAND; MARKET; DISCRIMINATION; COMPETITION; PROTECTION; EXHAUSTION; QUALITY; HEALTH; IMPACT,"The impact of parallel trade on innovation in R&D-intensive industries, such as pharmaceuticals, is a hotly debated question in antitrust and IP policy. The well-known argument that parallel trade dampens innovation by undermining firms' ability to price discriminate has been challenged by recent literature. The argument is that with endogenous price controls, parallel trade increases innovation by reducing governments' incentives to set particularly low price caps. In this paper, we show that this result crucially depends on the degree of homogeneity of the trading countries. The result only holds if consumers in poorer countries have a relatively similar demand for medication as consumers in richer countries. Instead, when countries are relatively heterogeneous, parallel trade dampens innovation and lowers welfare by exporting price cap regulation from poorer to richer countries. These findings are in line with recent case evidence. We also show that when patent length is endogenous, richer countries will tend to choose longer patent protection with parallel trade, whereas equilibrium price caps tend to be tighter in that case.

Prometheus and his dissent from the order dismissing certiorari in LabCorp v. Metabolite, is strikingly similar to one of his critiques of copyright law in The Uneasy Case for Copyright, a well-known article he wrote as Professor Breyer more than forty-five years ago. In The Uneasy Case, Breyer argued that the burdens on duplication of technical articles imposed by copyright law restrict the flow of information and prevent scientists from enjoying spillover benefits of published research. His patent opinions on the Supreme Court, too, talk of diminished access to information resulting from intellectual property protection. In this Article, I contend that the parallel that Justice Breyer implicitly draws between the harms of copyright and patent is a questionable one. In particular, Justice Breyer's opinions on patentable subject matter do not address the notion that inducement of disclosure and dissemination of information is one of the very purposes of patent law, nor the idea that there are many noninfringing uses of information contained in patents. I argue that these omissions may provide an insight into Justice Breyer's patent law jurisprudence-particularly, the recent reinvigoration of limits on patentable subject matter in his opinion for the Court in Mayo.",2016,Government & Law
Identifying Technological Topic Changes in Patent Claims Using Topic Modeling,Tech mining; Topic modeling; Patent analysis; INTELLIGENCE; TOOL,"Patent claims usually embody the core technological scope and the most essential terms to define the protection of an invention, which makes them the ideal resource for patent topic identification and theme changes analysis. However, conducting content analysis manually on massive technical terms is very time-consuming and laborious. Even with the help of traditional text mining techniques, it is still difficult to model topic changes over time, because single keywords alone are usually too general or ambiguous to represent a concept. Moreover, term frequency that used to rank keywords cannot separate polysemous words that are actually describing a different concept. To address this issue, this research proposes a topic change identification approach based on latent dirichlet allocation, to model and analyze topic changes and topic-based trend with minimal human intervention. After textual data cleaning, underlying semantic topics hidden in large archives of patent claims are revealed automatically. Topics are defined by probability distributions over words instead of terms and their frequency, so that polysemy is allowed. A case study using patents published in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 2009 to 2013 with Australia as their assignee country is presented, to demonstrate the validity of the proposed topic change identification approach. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach can be used as an automatic tool to provide machine-identified topic changes for more efficient and effective R&D management assistance.",2016,Business & Economics; Computer Science
Are biosimilars patentable?,Biologics; biosimilars; FDA; law; patent; pharmaceuticals; ,"Introduction: This paper explores whether, and under what circumstances, a biosimilar approved in the United States under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (hereafter BPCIA') can be patented. The possibility that a biosimilar product could have meaningful patent protection arises from specific requirements for biosimilarity under the BPCIA, which account for the fact that manufacturing processes of biologics are inherently imprecise. The requirements for biosimilar approval may provide sufficient leeway to a biosimilar applicant to patent structural or formulation differences that provide non-clinical but business-relevant advantages over the reference molecule, such as improved shelf-life or ease of manufacture, without compromising clinical biosimilarity.Areas covered: Examination of the BPCIA and related Acts, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance papers, case law, patent database searching, and relevant scholarly articles.Expert opinion: Legislative and regulatory requirements for the approval of a biosimilar under the BPCIA are focused on clinical results and allow a degree of leeway for differences to exist between a biosimilar's structure and non-clinical components and those of the biosimilar's reference molecule. This leeway can be exploited to provide the biosimilar with potentially patentable business-relevant advantages over its reference product while maintaining clinical biosimilarity to the reference product.",2016,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

European states have attempted to meet these challenges, resulting in law that directly deals with biotechnology at the national and European level. However, whether different states have dealt with biotechnology in a logical and clear manner is another question. This article discusses law that has been created through the European Union and European Patent Office, before addressing and comparing the manner in which Germany and Switzerland have implemented this law into their national statutes. It concludes that neither state has technologically sound law, creating distinctions that are not practically logical. The final part of this article discusses a term that was introduced into European patent law through the 'Biotech Directive', through the requirement that applicants disclose an industrial application or 'function' for a sequence or partial sequence of a gene.

This eliminates monopoly distortions. As tradeable assets, bounty claims can earn intertemporal bounties or state-dependent prizes, conditioned on time-varying market sales from bountiable goods multiplied by a time-invariant bounty rate. Creative destruction can make some bounty claims worthless, however. Government collects taxes to pay bounties. The switch from patents to intertemporal bounties is simulated using an R&D-based growth model calibrated to the U.S. economy. Funded by a tax on labor income, the regime switch can generate a consumption-equivalent welfare gain of 7%. This is considered the maximum opportunity cost to keep the U.S. patent system, as the labor income tax is non-distortionary in the model. Funded by the distortionary capital income tax, the regime switch can remain welfare-improving, provided the bounty rate is set appropriately. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Employing two-loop, generic system archetypes, our intent is to help stakeholders in intellectual property (IP) understand some of the nuances influencing the patent lifecycle linked to AIA. Building on the lingua franca used in patent law, our article highlights four important changes: being the first-to-file for protection; eliminating best mode disclosure; expanding the definition of prior art; and expanding post-grant review. Armed with a better understanding of the system issues imbedded in the legislation, innovators and entrepreneurs can develop strategies to deal with the attendant issues. For example, the tragedy of the commons associated with first-to-file highlights the need to increase R&D resources; else, over time incremental innovation will inevitably dominate efforts to modify the patent portfolio. Overall, AIA represents a step forward in harmonizing the US with the rest of the world while it increases the transparency of the legal maze that remains patent law; however, the changes bring allocation issues, secrecy, and time pressure to the forefront of the conversation about new product development. Recognition of these impacts is relevant worldwide for anyone contemplating a US patent or any entity attempting to maintain a viable portfolio of intellectual property.",2019,Business & Economics

Welfare-optimal patent royalties when imitation is costly,Damages; Entry; Invention; Patents; Prize system; Royalties; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; PRICE,"We identify welfare-optimal patent royalties in a model of costly imitation, entry and imperfect competition. When the social planner may impose a compulsory license, optimal royalties either blockade imitation, facilitating unregulated monopoly, or yield an aggregate-zero-profit efficient duopoly. When duopoly is optimal, the optimal per-unit royalty pins the equilibrium price at the aggregate average cost and the optimal fixed royalty shifts surplus so the patentee and imitator break even. Efficient duopoly yields higher welfare than monopoly for sufficiently low invention cost, and may also yield higher welfare than a prize system. Interestingly, royalty payments may be negative. Because of this, efficient duopoly may not be feasible if the planner must instead direct the courts to use such royalties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017,Business & Economics

Yet they are extremely expensive, costing on average $10,000-$30,000 per year and exceed $500,000 for the most expensive biologics. The advent of biosimilar drugs, or high similar copies of biologics, was supposed to help reduce costs, but thus far the cost of treatment with biologics or biosimilars has not fallen sharply in the USA. We argue that a primary hurdle is the extent of patent protection for the reference biologics that impedes greater numbers of biosimilars entering into the market. To date, of the 12 biosimilars approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), only five are commercially available. All but one of the remaining biosimilars are withheld from commercialization due to patent disputes. We argue that the market for biologics and biosimilars will become price competitive only if more biosimilars are available to patients. To this end, the process to eliminate marginally inventive patents held by the reference drug makers must be streamlined and improved. In this perspective article, we suggest actions to improve the pre-FDA approval patent resolution process known as the patent dance, the streamlined patent invalidation process known as Inter Partes Reviews, and the process of granting patents.",2018,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology
A PATENTABILITY REQUIREMENT AND INDUSTRY-TARGETED R&D,Innovations; Intellectual Property Rights; Productivity Distribution; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; PATENT POLICY; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; STIMULATE; KNOWLEDGE; IMITATION; MODEL,"I introduce a minimum innovation size required for patents into a Schumpeterian growth model. We show that to satisfy the patentability requirement for minimum innovation size, each research and development (R&D) firm targets only industries in which the incumbent's technology is of sufficient obsolescence. This is because the technological gap between innovator and incumbent is greater in industries using older technologies. Although the increase in minimum innovation size reduces the number of industries targeted for R&D, it also increases the amount of R&D investment directed at those targeted industries. Consequently, introducing a minimum innovation size has a nonmonotonic (or negative) effect on the aggregate flow of innovations. Further, by deriving the endogenous long-run distribution of innovation size, we show that an increase in minimum innovation size reduces the mean innovation size. This implies that even if the patent office only grants patents for superior innovations, it causes innovators to produce generally inferior-quality innovations.",2018,Business & Economics
Automating the search for a patent's prior art with a full text similarity search,; QUERY EXPANSION,"More than ever, technical inventions are the symbol of our society's advance. Patents guarantee their creators protection against infringement. For an invention being patentable, its novelty and inventiveness have to be assessed. Therefore, a search for published work that describes similar inventions to a given patent application needs to be performed. Currently, this so-called search for prior art is executed with semi-automatically composed keyword queries, which is not only time consuming, but also prone to errors. In particular, errors may systematically arise by the fact that different keywords for the same technical concepts may exist across disciplines. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed, where the full text of a given patent application is compared to existing patents using machine learning and natural language processing techniques to automatically detect inventions that are similar to the one described in the submitted document. Various state-of-the-art approaches for feature extraction and document comparison are evaluated. In addition to that, the quality of the current search process is assessed based on ratings of a domain expert. The evaluation results show that our automated approach, besides accelerating the search process, also improves the search results for prior art with respect to their quality.",2019,Science & Technology - Other Topics

More specifically, the main objective is to understand, through the SEW (Socioemotional Wealth) lens, whether innovative family firms tend to use patents as a tool for protecting intellectual property. Based on a sample of 229 Italian companies that make R&D investments, our analysis highlights that degree of alignment with the family business model is a significant predictor of a firm's attitude toward protecting innovation with patents, even though not all of the dimensions of a family business have the same effect. When disentangling the effect of three different indicators (i.e., family ownership, family governance and the presence of young successors), family involvement in the board of directors is a negative significant driver, the presence of young successors is a positive driver, and ownership has no effect.

Genetically Modified Plants: The IP and Regulatory Concerns in India,rDNA technology; Genetically modified plants; Transformation; Plant variety; Patents; ,"The status of patent protection for genetically modified plants is presently uncertain in India and is a debate rife with economic and ethical considerations. The need for consistent public policy and robust frameworks for regulatory control poses significant challenges for the introduction of genetically engineered/modified crop plants in India. This is especially vital considering India's desire to foster an innovation-based economy. The research questions of this chapter include the following: How is the insertion of different traits, such as insect resistance in plants by methods such as transformation different from introgression/hybridization? Can genetic modification of plants by methods such as transformation be termed as an essentially biological process? If not, how can the said process be classified for the purpose of Section 3(j) of the Indian Patents Act, 1970?",2019,Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law
THE LAW OF LOOK AND FEEL,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; DESIGN PROTECTION; COPYRIGHT; ECONOMICS; INNOVATION; PATENTS; SELF,"Design which encompasses everything from shape, color, and packaging to user interface, consumer experience, and brand aura is the currency of modern consumer culture and increasingly the subject of intellectual property claims. But the law of design is confused and confusing, splintered among various doctrines in copyright, trademark, and patent law. Indeed, while nearly every area of IP law protects design, the law has taken a siloed approach, with separate disciplines developing ad hoc rules and exceptions. To address this lack of coherence, this Article provides the first comprehensive assessment of the regulation of consumers' aesthetic experiences in copyright, trademark, and patent law what we call the law of look and feel. We canvas the diverse ways that parties have utilized (and stretched) intellectual property law to protect design in a broad range of products and services, from Pac-Man to Louboutin shoes to the iPhone. In so doing, we identify existing doctrines and principles that inform a normatively desirable law of look and feel that courts and Congress should extend throughout IP law's protection of design. We argue that design law should protect elements of look and feel but remain sensitive to eliminating or mitigating exclusive rights in response to evolving standardization, consumer expectations, and context. Notably, our normative conception of design protection sometimes departs quite starkly from how courts have expansively conceptualized look and feel as protectable subject matter. Going further, we argue that the new enclosure movement of design, if not comprehensively reformed and grounded in theory, can erode innovation, competition, and culture itself.",2017,Government & Law
Does Increased Spending on Pharmaceutical Marketing Inhibit Pioneering Innovation?,pharmaceutical industry; innovation; marketing; patent; health care reform; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DRUG DISCOVERY; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; FIRMS; SPILLOVERS; PATENTS; MODELS,"The pharmaceutical industry has been criticized for developing and aggressively marketing drugs that do not provide significant health benefits relative to existing drugs but retain the benefits of patent protection. Critics argue that drug marketing increases health care expenditures and provides a disincentive for pioneering drug innovation. However, evidence that marketing expenditures have any relationship to new drug approvals has been anecdotal. We hypothesized that, at publicly traded pharmaceutical firms, increased marketing expenditures will result in a reduced volume of pioneering new drugs in comparison to less innovative new drugs. We also hypothesized that additional research and development spending will result in an increased volume of pioneering new drugs in comparison to less innovative drugs. Results confirm our hypotheses. Specific policy recommendations for altering firms' incentives for the development of pioneering drugs are provided.",2016,Health Care Sciences & Services; Legal Medicine; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences
Corporate Social Responsibility of Pharmaceutical Industry Towards Access to Medicine: A Case Study of GlaxoSmithKline,; HEALTH DIPLOMACY; ADHERENCE; FRAMEWORK; THERAPY; DRUGS,India has changed its patent policy in 2005. It was compliance to WTO TRIPs provision and after this there was prohibition on process or generic manufacturing. India is the biggest supplier of affordable generic medicines and this patent protection is said to be beneficial to novel drug manufacturing countries. The generic drugs can be a differentiation factor between lives starting point and the ending point for millions of people in developing countries. This remains an obstacle to inexpensive generic medicines which results in devastating impact on the poorer people. These patent laws allow large MNC's to place 'profits over people'. World Health Organisation report price of medicines are important for maintaining the affordability and access of the medicines. This research evaluates the strategies and practices of Glaxo Smith Kline in contribution towards the access to medicines and their contribution of corporate social responsibility in India.,2017,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering; Public Administration; Biomedical Social Sciences
SECRECY IS DEAD - LONG LIVE TRADE SECRETS,; LAW,"The future of intellectual property is in trade secrets. Changes to patent law make obtaining a patent more costly in some cases and impossible in others. The relentless spread of networked computing, with its inevitable vulnerabilities, and digital data make non-legal means of maintaining secrecy increasingly unreliable. Innovators will be forced to turn to trade secrets. This newfound prominence for trade secrecy will generate tensions with freedom of speech protections, federalism, and the balance between civil and criminal enforcement.

Freedom-to-operate analysis of a transgenic multivitamin corn variety,transgenic maize; intellectual property analysis; carotenoids; insect resistance; humanitarian aspects; PRO-VITAMIN; BIOFORTIFICATION; TRANSFORMATION; PATHWAY; RICE,"In this article, we explore the intellectual property (IP) landscape relevant to the production and commercialization of Carolight, a transgenic multivitamin corn variety created on humanitarian grounds to address micronutrient deficiencies in low-and-middle-income countries. The successful production of this variety requires IP rights risk management because there is a strong protection on inventions and processes via patent portfolios in both developing and industrialized countries. The IP framework is complex, and specialist patent lawyers are usually employed to perform such analysis, but the costs cannot always be met by small, publicly funded projects. We report an alternative strategy, a do-it-yourself patent analysis, to produce a review with limited legal value that can nevertheless lay the foundations for a subsequent more in-depth professional freedom-to-operate opinion.",2016,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Plant Sciences
Keeping Secrets: The Economics of Access Deterrence,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ENTRY; EXIT; COORDINATION; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; ADOPTION; PATENTS,"Keeping valuable secrets requires costly protection efforts. Breaking them requires costly search efforts. In a dynamic model in which the value of the secret decreases with the number of those holding it, we examine the secret holders' protection decisions and the secret breakers' timing of entry, showing that the original secret holder's payoff can be very high, even when protection appears weak, with implications for innovators' profits from unpatented innovations. We show that the path of entry will be characterized by two waves, the first of protected entry followed by a waiting period, and a second wave of unprotected entry.",2016,Business & Economics
DNA labelling of varieties covered by patent protection: a new solution for managing intellectual property rights in the seed industry,Nicotiana benthamiana; DNA labelling; Patents on plant varieties; DNA coding; DNA decoding; REAL-TIME PCR; TRANSGENIC PLANTS; GENE; MARKERS; TOOL,"Plant breeders' rights are undergoing dramatic changes due to changes in patent rights in terms of plant variety rights protection. Although differences in the interpretation of A >> breeder's exemptionA <<, termed research exemption in the 1991 UPOV, did exist in the past in some countries, allowing breeders to use protected varieties as parents in the creation of new varieties of plants, current developments brought about by patenting conventionally bred varieties with the European Patent Office (such as EP2140023B1) have opened new challenges. Legal restrictions on germplasm availability are therefore imposed on breeders while, at the same time, no practical information on how to distinguish protected from non-protected varieties is given. We propose here a novel approach that would solve this problem by the insertion of short DNA stretches (labels) into protected plant varieties by genetic transformation. This information will then be available to breeders by a simple and standardized procedure. We propose that such a procedure should consist of using a pair of universal primers that will generate a sequence in a PCR reaction, which can be read and translated into ordinary text by a computer application. To demonstrate the feasibility of such approach, we conducted a case study. Using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation protocol, we inserted a stretch of DNA code into Nicotiana benthamiana. We also developed an on-line application that enables coding of any text message into DNA nucleotide code and, on sequencing, decoding it back into text. In the presented case study, a short command line coding the phrase A >> Hello worldA << was transformed into a DNA sequence that was inserted in the plant genome. The encoded message was reconstructed from the resulting T1 seedlings with 100 % accuracy. The feasibility and possible other applications of this approach are discussed.",2017,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

These imperatives derive from complex legal geographies: international law (such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol), State and federal laws, Indigenous customary law, codes of ethics and research protocols. This paper reports on a patent landscape' analysis of patents that refer to Australian plant species for which there is Indigenous Australian knowledge. We have identified several patents of potential new biopiracy concern. The paper highlights the way in which actors can gain private property monopolies over biological resources and associated traditional knowledge, even though there are overlapping sovereign rights and Indigenous rights claims. Regulatory gaps need to be closed nationally to fully govern the diverse human-plant bio-geographies in Australia. Further, Indigenous laws and governance have largely been ignored by these actors. We suggest that the introduction of disclosure of origin' requirements in patent applications, sui generis Indigenous knowledge protections, the development of biocultural protocols, and a more nationally consistent system for access and benefit-sharing' are required to ensure more fair and equitable' use of plants and Indigenous knowledge in/from Australia, and to ensure the recognition of Indigenous rights to knowledge.",2017,Geography

Yet less is known whether this effect is stronger for technology-intensive products. Using data for 119 countries over the period 1976-2010, this paper shows that the impact of IPR protection on manufacturing imports is significantly stronger for products with greater technology embodiment, as measured by their R&D intensity. An increase in the level of IPR protection leads to 22 per cent faster increase in the value of imports of products at the 90th percentile of R&D intensity than products at the 10th percentile.",2017,Business & Economics

Based on patent data, this paper analyzes the development trends and the status quo of technical innovation of shale gas quantitatively by means of patent maps. A new dynamic model named Forward-Citation Full Path (FCFP) is investigated to identify the key development paths in technology clusters and monitor potential breakthrough technologies on those key paths. Then we employ topic modeling and text mining for patent abstracts to explore the potential promising topics with high innovation activeness in aid of providing specific references for development and foresight of the shale gas technology. The results show that: (1) The patent center of shale gas has been transferring from North American to the Asia-Pacific region and the technological innovation is mainly driven by preferential tax policy and loose environmental regimes. (2) Current hotspots of shale gas technology are production technique including stimulation treatments, environmental protection technology of fracturing fluid and geological prospecting technology. (3) There are five potential topics with high innovation activeness identified by topic modeling and text mining which are synthetic carbon oxide, hydraulic fracturing, fracturing propping agents, horizontal well, and technologies of reservoir exploration and modeling. (4) By means of visualization of technology clusters, it is found that promising technologies are refined simulation technology for shale gas exploration, multi-interval fracturing techniques in horizontal wells with deep pay zones, water treatment and environmental protection technology in shale gas production. (5) The suggested dynamic FCFP model can effectively identify the key development paths and monitor potential breakthrough technology of shale gas.",2017,Energy & Fuels; Engineering

Academic entrepreneurship and academic patenting are two closely related means to do so and, more often than not, patenting activity and entrepreneurship are part of a linear sequence in the commercialization process. This paper is mainly concerned with the first step. To further academic patenting, university administrations have installed or expanded existing technology transfer offices (TTOs) as active stakeholders in the university ecosystem. These offices must find the right measures (e.g., monetary or non-monetary incentives or providing information at internal events) and offer them to the right group of scientists (e.g., departments) at the right point in time. This is challenging because scientists' decision whether to publish or patent depends on several factors, including individual preferences, perceived normative social pressure from peers, level of information received through word-of-mouth communication or informational events, and previous first-hand experience. An agent-based simulation approach may serve as a decision aid for this purpose. Such an approach models stakeholders as agents' who interact with each other, and through these interactions, the system's behavior evolves and can be observed. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based simulation for evaluating measures that can be employed by a TTO in order to stimulate academic patenting and, subsequently, the foundation of spin-off companies relying on such patents. The applicability of the approach is illustrated through an example.",2019,Engineering; Business & Economics
Comparative Study on Chinese and Global OLED Industry Based on Patent Data,Chip industry; OLED technology; comparative analysis; PageRank algorithm; dominant technology; ,"Against the background of intelligent manufacturing, the development of chip technology has been widely discussed by scholars. The Chinese chip industry is constantly hit upon in the international background, and the reasons behind this exploration are particularly important for the future development of chip technology in the country. To solve this problem, the paper chooses to study the typical OLED technology in the chip industry. This paper uses 14979 patent data of OLED technology, from 1900 to 2017, as the research object. Data are taken from the global patent statistics database (PATSTAT). From the perspective of the annual application numbers and main research content, it is concluded that Chinese OLED technology has been a late starter, with companies mainly choosing the road of importing equipment OLED technology lacks specific direction in view of the mastered technical patents, and the related technology is mostly in the peripheral activities. Therefore, OLED technology cannot enter the core area of this field. In this paper, the leading technology identification model, based on a PageRank algorithm, is used to identify the leading technology in the global and domestic OLED patents, and we compare the patents' holders. It is concluded that the Chinese OLED industry cannot occupy a favorable position on the international stage; some research institutes in China have R&D ability, but they lack production facilities. The development of industrialization restricts the sustainable development of related technologies. In view of the above results, this paper provides suggestions from the perspective of researchers, related enterprises, and government and patent protection agencies, in order to promote the development of the Chinese OLED industry and to play a referential role in the growth of China's chip industry.",2018,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications
Protecting essential information about genetic variants as trade secrets: a problem for public policy?,trade secret; public policy; myriad genetics; march-in rights; genetic test; genetic variant; SEQUENCE VARIANTS; ASSOCIATION; GENOMICS,"In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held that naturally occurring human genes are not patentable subject matter. This decision, invalidating patents held by Myriad Genetics involving genes affecting breast cancer, appeared to further the constitutional policy behind intellectual property protection to promote scientific progress and to make genetic testing more readily available to patients. However, the decision's ironic aftermath is continuing assertion by genetic testing companies of trade secrets protections over information about the significance of genetic variants. This article analyzes possible approaches to the assertion of trade secret protections over information about the significance of genetic variants. Specifically, we consider five approaches: voluntary responses from the scientific community; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or CMS regulation; creation of additional march-in rights as under the Bayh Dole Act; compulsory licensing as under patent law; and creation of a public policy exception to trade secret protection. We explore what each approach would require legally if applied to break trade secret barriers, together with their advantages and disadvantages. While our analysis concerns genetic information, we conclude with some thoughts about its relevance to other types of big data now protected by trade secrets such as information about innovations in quality of care.",2018,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine
"Trade Secrecy Injunctions, Disclosure Risks, and eBay's Influence",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LIABILITY RULES; PATENT HOLDUP; COVENANTS; KNOWLEDGE; DOCTRINE; LAW,"Historically, intellectual property (IP) owners could rely on injunctive remedies to prevent continued infringement. The Supreme Court's eBay v. MercExchange decision changed this, however. After eBay, patent courts no longer apply presumptions that push the deliberative scales in favor of injunctions (or property rule protection). Instead, patent injunctions require a careful four-factor analysis, where plaintiffs must demonstrate irreparable injury (i.e., that money damages cannot compensate). Without question, eBay has made it harder for patent plaintiffs to secure injunctions, and has led many district courts to consider innovation policy concerns (e.g., the strategic behavior of patent troll plaintiffs) in the injunction calculus. By and large, courts' more deliberative approach to patent injunctions post-eBay has been viewed as beneficial for the patent system. Over the past decade, eBay's influence has migrated to other areas of IP. This article offers the first account of eBay's impact on federal trade secrecy injunctions. Important differences between trade secret law and other areas of IP-for example, the hard-to-quantify risk that disclosure poses to trade secret owners-has lessened eBay's influence on trade secrecy injunctions. This article argues that disclosure risks justify a bifurcated approach to trade secrecy injunctions. That is, in cases involving the dissemination of trade secrets, courts should presume irreparable injury in the injunction calculus. However, in cases involving the unauthorized use of a trade secret-that is, where a defendant builds upon a plaintiff's trade secret but does not disseminate it-courts should not presume irreparable harm and, instead, should apply the eBay framework. As part of this assessment, courts should consider policy concerns related to cumulative innovation and employee mobility.",2019,Business & Economics; Government & Law

Yet the Supreme Court has approached these areas from distinctly different angles. With copyright, the Court readily employs constitutional analysis, building fences to constrain Congress. With patent, it emphasizes statutory interpretation, demarcating paths the legislature can follow, or deviate from (potentially at its constitutional peril). This Article uses empirical and quantitative analysis to show this divergence. It offers two potential explanations, one based on entitlement strength, the other grounded in public choice concerns. Next, the Article explores border cases where the Court could have used either fences or paths, demonstrating the effects of this pattern. It sets out criteria that the Court should employ in choosing between these approaches: counter-majoritarian concerns, institutional competence, pragmatism, and avoidance theory. The Article argues that the key normative principle is that the Court should erect fences when cases impinge on intellectual property's core constitutional concerns information disclosure for patent and information generation for copyright. It concludes with two examples where the Court should alter its approach based on this principle.",2019,Government & Law

Fisheries technology management at Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR): An IPR perspective,IPC; IPR; Partnerships; Patents; Technology commercialization; Technology protection; Trademarks; ,"Technology management in intellectual property rights (IPR) is a procedure, which incorporates technology production, promotion and their commercialization. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is an autonomous organization, and is the apex body for coordinating, guiding and managing research and education in agriculture in the entire country. With the aim of utilizing the vast research and development facilities and knowledge available with its institutions, ICAR has started a technology management and business incubation drive, intended for the Indian agricultural sector to promote agribusiness. This apex body has established a three-tier IP management system, which is presently giving a scope of demonstrated results by securing its research assets with different IP tools like patents, trademarks and designs; and commercializing its research outcomes. Six ICAR fisheries research institutes filed 84 patent applications, out of which 55 were filed during the last 5 years. Seven patents were conceded to 3 of these establishments, which fall under the IPC classifications A, B, C and E. Eight trademarks were additionally enlisted at the Indian Trademark Registry for diverse fish based products. To commercialize the fisheries research outcomes, including 142 technologies, 207 partnerships were developed by various institutes with 135 national and international organizations. IP protected technology commercialization is on its higher side with 21.12%, achieved within a short time span. These endeavors of technology management at ICAR, coupled with an effective technology protection and commercialization of the vast and diversified ICAR knowledge base, gave a renewed boost and a decent way for the Indian fisheries research and a new agribusiness paradigm.",2015,Agriculture
Institutional Regime Shift in Intellectual Property Rights and Innovation Strategies of Firms in China,intellectual property rights; innovation strategy; institutional change; emerging economy; China; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CULTURAL DISTANCE; PATENT RIGHTS; TRANSITION; KNOWLEDGE; NETWORKS; SURVIVAL; EMBEDDEDNESS; LIABILITY,"This study develops a novel conceptual framework to understand the differential impact of formal institutional regime shift in intellectual property rights on the innovation and patenting strategies of Chinese and Western firms operating in China. We argue that to the extent that Chinese firms have been deeply embedded in China's informal institutions, they are less responsive to formal institutional changes than Western firms operating in China. Using the major China patent law reform of 2001 as an exogenous event, we find results consistent with our key arguments: With the strengthening of the previously weak ( utility model) patent protection, Chinese firms are less likely to apply for such patents to safeguard their innovations than Western firms. However, this difference becomes less pronounced in regions with higher quality intellectual property rights and legal institutions that foster research and development and innovation, and when Western firms gain longer operational experience in China. This study advances our understanding of the intricate interaction between formal and informal institutions and specifically how stickiness may arise in their substitutive relationship because of the embeddedness of firms in informal institutional environments. It also provides important implications for policy and innovation strategies for policy makers and firms in emerging economies.",2017,Business & Economics
Patentability Standards for Follow-On Pharmaceutical Innovation,UNDP; patentability guidelines; patent examination; pharmaceutical patents; TRIPS Agreement; DRUGS,"Follow-on pharmaceutical innovation occurring after the initial discovery of a drug active ingredient plays an important, but at times underappreciated, role in providing innovative solutions to compelling medical needs. Examples of follow-on innovation include new forms of a drug with improved safety-efficacy profiles, new formulations and dosages providing improved patient outcomes, and new methods of using an established drug more safely or to treat new indications. Patents play a critical role in incentivizing the research, development, testing, and ultimately commercialization of follow-on pharmaceutical innovation, and in doing so provide substantial benefits for public health and patients' quality of life. There is, however, a body of literature characterizing patents directed towards follow-on innovations as secondary pharmaceutical patents. Some have even gone so far as to propose that the criteria for patentability should be enforced more stringently with respect to follow-on pharmaceutical inventions as compared to other inventions. The underlying assumption of such proposals is that follow-on pharmaceutical innovations are somehow secondary to other pharmaceutical innovation, and thus less deserving of patent protection. In this article, we refute the notion that follow-on pharmaceutical innovation should be categorically singled out for unfavorable treatment under the patent laws, and provide numerous examples of the value that follow-on innovation brings to medicine, and ultimately to patients. We also propose, in view of the international treaty obligations set out in, inter alia, the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), standards and best practices for assessing the patentability of inventions arising out of follow-on pharmaceutical innovation. These are essentially the same stringent standards applicable to primary pharmaceutical innovation, and inventions in general. This article provides numerous examples from jurisdictions around the world in which patent offices and courts have applied the well-recognized requirements of patentability, including patent eligibility, novelty, inventive step and industrial application, to follow-on pharmaceutical inventions, and in so doing have advanced innovation in public health and ultimately the lives of patients.",2018,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

This provides a novel means to study the short and long run effect of invention antecedents on technological evolution, invention activity, and economic growth. A comparison between models of technological influence and direct technological impact is presented. Model estimations are based on data from semiconductor patents granted over a 5-year period. Results from quantile regression estimations show significant differences in the relationships between antecedents of technological influence and impact. For example, pioneering the spanning of knowledge boundaries has a positive relationship with the patent's influence, while no relationship is found with direct citations. These results have important implications for public policy and the management of technology. They suggest the need for deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of the technological evolution process and raise the question of whether inventors under current IP protection receive adequate economic incentives to promote actions driving economic growth.

Indian Patent Law and Its Impact on the Pharmaceutical Industry: What Can China Learn from India?,Patent; Pharmaceutical industry; Generic drug; Compulsory license; Bolar exception; Evergreening; ,"Both China and India are developing countries in the pharmaceutical industry, and both need to seek a balance between protecting intellectual property rights and satisfying people's healthcare needs. They also need to promote innovation and encourage the development of domestic industries. As members of the WTO, China and India have made a series of amendments to their respective intellectual property systems to live up to the TRIPS Agreement's minimum standards of protection, including recognition of pharmaceutical product patents, introduction of a compulsory licensing system, and Bolar exception. In promoting the development of its domestic pharmaceutical industry, India's experience in legislation and judicial practice deserves serious attention from China, such as using TRIPS's flexibility to facilitate access to medicines, implementing compulsory licensing to create more chances for voluntary licensing negotiation, and updating the guidelines for examining pharmaceutical applications to prevent ever-greening of pharmaceutical patents.

The private value of plant variety protection and the impact of exemption rules,IPRs; research exemption; farmers' exemption; plant variety creation; renewals; PATENT RENEWALS; OPTIONS; RIGHTS,"Plant Breeders Rights (PBRs) are sui generis IPRs intended to promote plant variety creation. Two characteristics distinguish PBRs from patents: the research and the farmers' exemptions. This article attempts to assess the impact of these exemption rules on the private value of PBRs. For this purpose, a microeconometric model of PBRs renewals is developed and estimated. This model extends previous models of patents renewals by allowing the use of PBRs-specific variables. It is argued that simple tests on the coefficients associated with key PBRs-specific variables can provide insights into the impact of the two exemption rules. Implementation to PBRs in France over the period 1973-2011 for six major crops suggests that neither the farmers' exemption nor the research exemption have a clear-cut effect on the private value of PBRs. We conclude that there is no evidence to argue in favor of a reform of PBRs.",2017,Business & Economics

"Industrial Property or Artistic Property? Design, Intellectual Property Law and the PH Lamp",aesthetics; copyright; Denmark; functionalism; patent law; PH lamp; ,"The status of design under intellectual property law is unresolved in a number of ways; for more than three centuries design has vacillated in between legal categories. Notably, many current problems in the protection of intellectual property in design were already apparent by the mid-nineteenth century. Thus, in the first part of this article, the origins of and legal responses to problems that still complicate design-related intellectual property law are traced. The specific focus is on British law, which was a forerunner for other national laws on design protection. The second part of the article concentrates on Danish law and on the PH lamp, created in the 1920s by the Danish designer Poul Henningsen. An 'intellectual property biography' of the PH lamp serves to illustrate the unstable status of design under intellectual property law. Poul Henningsen relied on patent law as well as copyright law for protection against rivals. Hence the lamp has been defined, respectively, as both 'industrial property' and 'artistic property'; as an invention and as a work of art. The twofold character of the lamp in law may be linked to an unresolved relationship, in modern design in particular, between aesthetics and utility.",2017,Art
Implementing Intellectual Property of Pharmaceuticals in Middle-Income Countries: A Case Study of Patent Regulation in Brazil,pharmaceutical regulation; policy analysis; health policy; pharmaceutical patents; ,"The protection of pharmaceutical intellectual property (IP) rights is one of the most controversial debates in contemporary public health as countries have to balance incentives for drug development with the necessity of providing life-saving drugs. Compliance with IP protections is mandatory for members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, because of the costs associated with IP implementation we should expect late and/or poor implementation in middle-income countries. Surprisingly, this was not the case in Brazil. The country not only just fully implemented the WTO's requirement but declined the grace period granted for countries to adapt and included extra IP protections, going against a coalition of local industrialists and activists. Notwithstanding, as the consequences of IP regulations unfolds, Brazil also promoted new alliances that tailored and adjusted the regulations toward public health. We demonstrate that arguments of foreign pressure and lobbying are exaggerated and call attention to domestic shifts, long-term processes of regulatory decision, and political dynamics happening at the local level. By analyzing the case of Brazil, we provide a nuanced contribution to the discussion of IP implementation in middle-income countries and call attention to new models of government-society interactions in regulatory policy.",2016,Health Care Sciences & Services; Legal Medicine; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences

While this enormously facilitates the sharing of information, both for personal and professional purposes, it also introduces some critical problems concerning the ownership of the information. Data is an intangible good that is stored in large data warehouses, where the hardware architectures and software programs running the cloud services coexist with the data of many users. This context calls for a twofold protection: on one side, the cloud is made up of hardware and software that constitute the business assets of the service provider (property of the cloud); on the other side, there is a definite need to ensure that users retain control over their data (property in the cloud). The law grants protection to both sides under several perspectives, but the result is a complex mix of interwoven regimes, further complicated by the intrinsically international nature of cloud computing that clashes with the typical diversity of national laws. As the business model based on cloud computing grows, public bodies, and in particular the European Union, are striving to find solutions to properly regulate the future economy, either by introducing new laws, or by finding the best ways to apply existing principles.

In the two decades since, ARVs have become the subject of intense political debate and social justice mobilization. In particular, ARV intellectual property patent protections have become a high-profile trade and diplomacy issue, while major philanthropic organizations have entered the fray to support large-scale treatment programs. This article maps 21years of HIV/AIDS medicines coverage in mainstream newspapers to illustrate these developments and contestations. It demonstrates two main processes: first, where civil society mobilization successfully promoted ARVs onto the media and policy agenda, and second, where issue fragmentation and a changing political and media context saw ARVs dramatically exit the news coverage, despite the continuing catastrophic scale of the global HIV/AIDS medicines crisis.",2018,Communication; Sociology

The optimal level of IPR protection depends on the technological capability of the host country. In less developed countries, IPRs should be just strong enough to induce FDI since international technology spillovers are the dominant source of technological development. A stronger level of IPR protection is instead recommended for more advanced emerging economies as a tool to exploit the potential of their domestic innovators. The results cast doubt on the adequacy of globally harmonized IPR standards that do not consider the level of development.",2017,Business & Economics

Unlike in models with leapfrogging, granting forward protection, and imposing a non-obviousness requirement reduces growth. In the main case where entrants and incumbents have free access to the same R&D technology, infinite protection against imitation, granted independently of the size of the lead, maximizes growth. If entrants have to engage in costly catch up before they can undertake frontier R&D, growth is maximal for a finite (expected) length of protection against imitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Intellectual property rights and diaspora knowledge networks: Can patent protection generate brain gain from skilled migration?,; INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SELF-SELECTION; DRAIN; GROWTH; INNOVATION; TRADE; EARNINGS; ECONOMY; WAGES,This paper studies the mechanism through which intellectual property rights (IPR) protection can influence the impact of skilled migration on innovation activities in developing countries. We argue that knowledge acquired by emigrants abroad can flow back to their country of origin through diaspora networks. IPR protection in the sending country facilitates this channel by increasing returns to skills and encouraging workers to move into the innovation sector. An expansion of the innovation sector allows diaspora knowledge to be absorbed by a larger range of workers. Strong IPR enforcement therefore makes it more likely for brain drain to be transformed into brain gain.,2017,Business & Economics

Uncertain intellectual property conditions and knowledge appropriation strategies: Evidence from the genomics industry,; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; INNOVATION; SCIENCE; NETWORKS; RIGHTS; FIRMS; SCIENTISTS; PATENTS; IMPACT,"Innovating science-and technology-based firms often endure a sustained period of uncertain intellectual property rights (IPR) protection before patents could be granted to their valuable knowledge assets. This problem is exacerbated, as firms increasingly develop their innovations or operate in countries with weak IPR institutional environments. But how does IPR uncertainty affect firms' strategy toward knowledge appropriation-capturing of economic value from their knowledge assets-and toward providing access to these knowledge assets? Drawing on research from the economics of science and intellectual property strategy, we examine this question using a novel panel data covering 362 firms and organizations in the knowledge-intensive genomics industry based on all genomics patents and matching papers from 1988 to 2005. We find that under uncertain IPR conditions, firms reveal and accumulate more knowledge through open science (follow-on publishing) but shift to knowledge appropriation through commercial science (follow-on patenting) when IPR uncertainty is narrowed. This effect is most salient when firms develop their knowledge assets or operate under strong IPR institutional regime. For highly science-based knowledge assets, firms continue tapping into open science for access and reciprocity in knowledge acquisition from the scientific community. These findings highlight the role of patent grant as a potential lever to shape firms' knowledge processes and long-term innovative capacity, and the emergence of a concerted science strategy employed by firms.",2017,Business & Economics
WHAT'S SMALL SIZE GOT TO DO WITH IT?

One factor behind this is that the needed tools -such as the protection mechanisms of intellectual assets -may be more limited. In line with this notion, we examine the protection available for and used by small firms in their innovation activities. We approach the issue by conducting a review on the relevant literature, and use a qualitative multiple case study conducted in eight small companies to empirically study the issue. Departing from prior research, we consider protection of innovations by distinguishing between the intangibles needed in innovation activities and the actual innovation outputs, and combine these considerations to the knowledge protection/ sharing dilemma.",2018,Business & Economics
Patent litigation and cross licensing with cumulative innovation,Patent; Litigation; Cross licensing; Cumulative innovation; R&D; Real options; SEQUENTIAL INNOVATION; ANTITRUST; ECONOMICS; BREADTH; POLICY; POOLS; SCOPE,"We investigate the firms' investment decisions in the presence of litigation over infringement and cross licensing as a way to settle. The model endogenously determines not only the timing of investments but also their capacities, the degree of overlap between the initial and the subsequent innovations, and the way the competitors resolve the dispute. It shows that the firms' R&D competition in the burgeoning market is more likely to entail a lawsuit and distinctly differentiated products, while they easily agree on cross licensing to utilize each other's works in the slow-growing market, leaving little difference between the products. From the perspective of public policy, it is clarified that the policy on patent scope cannot yield the first-best result in terms of the speed of innovation, and the welfare analysis shows that social welfare is higher when the conflict is settled via cross licensing. However, the weak protection on patent rights, which is shown to encourage cross licensing, does not always guarantee the highest level of social welfare since it weakens the leader's bargaining power in the negotiation, leading to fewer advanced products with higher prices.",2016,Business & Economics
Self-Centric and Altruistic Unmet Needs for Ebola: Barriers to International Preparedness,public policy; public health; needs assessment; international cooperation; HEALTH,"Objective Barriers to international Ebola preparedness may be elucidated by identifying heterogeneities in arguments to invest in countermeasures during peace time. Methods For each patent family (related patent documents that differed only by limited alterations to the same invention) concerning Ebola and published until the end of 2014 the oldest patent document was analyzed. Grounded theory coding identified 5 unmet needs for (1) vaccines and therapies, (2) control of outbreaks in endemic areas, (3) detection and control of outbreaks in nonendemic areas, (4) better understanding of filoviruses, and (5) protection against bioterrorism. Odds ratios for unmet needs by geographic regions and institution types were compared by using Pearson's chi-square test. Results Statistically significant heterogeneities in unmet need profiles were found. US applicants combined self-centric and altruistic arguments, focusing on medical unmet needs and bioterrorism protection. Russian and Asian applicants emphasized self-centric motives, specifically, detection and control of nonendemic outbreaks. A clear, statistically significant mismatch between industry and academia was found: whereas industrial applicants focused on bioterrorism and neglected detection and control of nonendemic outbreaks, academic applicants did the opposite. Conclusions This research identified heterogeneities in articulated needs between geographic regions and stakeholder types. Structural articulation of unmet needs may form the basis for attuning stakeholder engagement strategies while progression across the demand-driven value chain might necessitate international concordance.

"Competitive pressure, innovation and trade protection: Evidence from US patent data",patents; strategic trade protection; INTERMEDIATE INPUTS; PRODUCTIVITY; LIBERALIZATION; GROWTH,"Recent theoretical models have suggested that the relationship between competition and innovation may best be characterised as an inverted-U shape: firms in industries with low levels of competition are more likely to innovate in the wake of increased competition as they attempt to escape competition, while those in highly competitive industries will decrease innovation in the wake of increased competition as the profit incentive to innovate dissipates. Results from other studies have found positive as well as negative relationships between innovation and competition. In a parallel literature, trade economists have produced conflicting results regarding the impact of trade liberalisation on innovation. One stream of research has shown that increased access to imported intermediate goods increases productivity, suggesting a positive relationship between imports and innovation. Others have hypothesised that firms may use the technology embodied in intermediate inputs as a substitute for domestic innovation. In this paper, we merge these divergent literatures and investigate whether innovation, as measured by the production of patents by US manufacturers, has been impacted by market competition and tariff reductions. Our empirical findings indicate that insulation from imports in the form of higher tariffs on final goods was associated with innovation until the late 1980s, while falling tariffs on intermediate goods appear to have facilitated innovation during the 1990s. We also find evidence of the inverted U-shaped relationship between market competition and innovation.",2019,Business & Economics; International Relations
"BOUNDARIES, EXTRATERRITORIALITY, AND PATENT INFRINGEMENT DAMAGES",; LAW,"Patents are generally considered to be the most territorial of all the various forms of intellectual property. Even patent law, however, has confronted issues involving the application of a U.S. patent to extraterritorial activity. The Supreme Court has expressed an interest in both issues the extraterritorial application of U.S. law and patent law. At times, these interests have intersected. Notwithstanding the Court's recent elaborations on extraterritoriality, the approach by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has been, at best, inconsistent. At times the court has afforded extraterritorial protection, even in the face of strong territorial language in the patent statute itself. At other times, however, it has approached the issue of extraterritoriality more restrictively, even when the statute itself expressly contemplates the regulation of activities outside of the United States. This dynamic has been addressed by myself and other scholars. More recently, however, the Federal Circuit has addressed the issue of patent damages for extraterritorial activities. These scenarios have arisen because there necessarily has been an act of domestic patent infringement. The damages theory advocated by the patent holder, however, has attempted to ensnare overseas sales, either under a lost-profits or reasonable-royalty theory. Additionally, the Federal Circuit has begun to address the appropriate scope of damages for infringement under section 271(f) of the Patent Act, a provision that defines infringement as the exportation of all the components of an invention, or a single component with no substantial noninfringing use, where it is to be assembled abroad. Necessarily, this provision contemplates the regulation of foreign markets through the domestic hook of acts of exportation. The Federal Circuit, nevertheless, rejected the patentee's requested remedy in this case. This Article turns to the issue of the extraterritorial reach of patent damages. It analyzes the Federal Circuit's recent pronouncements using the two-step method articulated by the Supreme Court in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community. This analysis suggests that damages for infringement under various aspects of the Patent Act can be treated differently with respect to extraterritoriality. This Article goes on to suggest that the Federal Circuit's approach lacks nuance to account for the particular economic and legal circumstances that differentiate the different infringement provisions at stake. It draws on earlier work where I advocated for a conflicts-based approach to extraterritorial application of U.S. patents, and extends that work to these scenarios, offering a more balanced approach to assessing whether damages are appropriate in these circumstances. Finally, this Article explores whether the various damages theories involved in these cases, regardless of the territorial limits, suggest it is time to revisit the foreseeability/proximate cause aspect of Rite-Hite. The theories of damages seem quite far removed from the actual acts of infringement, even if they occurred within the United States. Some scholars have begun work on this enterprise, and these cases suggest such consideration is ripe.",2017,Government & Law
Sector-specific IPR protection to overcome technology-skill mismatch in South?

The North develops new technologies, while the South imitates them, and the paper investigates how sector-specific IPR in the South can change the ratio of low-skill to high-skill technologies adopted by the South in order to maximize its welfare. The paper shows that in autarky the optimal IPR policy that maximizes the welfare in the South requires that the high-skill intensive sector should receive stronger IPR protection. It also shows that under free-trade the IPR protection in the South's high-skill intensive sector should be even stronger. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Intellectual property rights and cross-border mergers and acquisitions,Intellectual property rights; Cross-border mergers and acquisitions; PATENT PROTECTION; DETERMINANTS; INNOVATION; LAWS,"We investigate the role of intellectual property rights protection in cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. We document a significant increase in inbound cross-border M&As after a country implements reforms that strengthen local intellectual property rights. Importantly, we find that intellectual property rights have an impact on merger activity only in industries that are more intellectual capital-intensive, and when the target country has weaker intellectual property rights protection than the acquirer country. We also find that synergy gains in cross-border M&As are positively related to reforms of intellectual property rights. These results are consistent with the notion that acquirers are concerned about the local protection of intellectual capital when considering foreign acquisitions, and care the most when the target firm is in an industry that uses intellectual property intensely and in a country that has lesser-developed protections that their own country does.

To do so we develop an equilibrium matching model with an imperfect labor and innovation market. If employment protection is introduced, firms' willingness to pay for product or process innovations increases. This shifts economic activity towards firms specializing in process and product innovation and triggers entry of new start-ups. We calibrate our model to match aggregate US labor and product market statistics and show that our model generates the negative impact of wrongful dismissal laws in the US on productivity and the positive effect on the number of innovations and firms found by the literature.",2017,Business & Economics

The pharmaceutical sector stands out among other industries in terms of implementation of various mechanisms of intellectual property rights protection, which guarantee the possibility to recover economic losses due to tremendous investments in R&D. However, intellectual property protection mechanisms trigger the rise of medication costs, which significantly influence state expenditures and limit patient's access to treatment.

Human Rights and Intellectual Property Protection: Their Interplay in Taiwan,Compulsory license; Copyright; Patent; Right to health; Right to information; ,"The interplay between human rights and intellectual property has been at the center of important debates in recent decades. This chapter includes three major sections to elaborate on Taiwan's efforts to implement human rights in its intellectual property regime. The first section introduces the interplay between human rights and intellectual property. Section 2 explores implementation of the right to information in copyright law. Section 3 addresses the interaction between the right to health and intellectual property protection. The chapter concludes by indicating that an over-protected IP system may be an obstacle in realizing human rights. If copyright is over-protected, it may guard the economic rights of creative intellectual activity, but its enforcement might impede access to published works for persons with print disabilities and lead to negative impacts on the right to information. In the public health field, without patents, existing medications and innovative pharmaceutical products which overcome diseases would not have been developed. Therefore, inadequate expansion and enforcement of IP protection might become a barrier to the accessibility and affordability of medications and adversely affect implementation of the right to health. For this reason, the international community pursues a proper balance between human rights and IP protection. As a member of the international community, Taiwan closely follows new developments at the international level and introduces amendments to its IP laws accordingly. Regardless of Taiwan's unique international status, it still manages to establish relevant mechanisms, consistent with international norms, in its domestic legal framework.",2019,Business & Economics
Multinational firms and the internationalization of green R&D: A review of the evidence and policy implications,Energy; R&D; Multinationals; Globalization; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS; INDUSTRY; PANEL,"This paper presents novel empirical evidence on the internationalization of green R&D by multinational firms (MNCs), as measured by patents data. Using data on inventors' addresses for the set of 1200 MNCs firms patenting in green technologies over the 2004-2009 period, we find that about 17% of green patents result from MNCs R&D investments conducted outside their home countries. MNCs tend to locate their foreign green R&D activities in other OECD markets and in China, in particular in lightings and solar technologies. The empirical analysis reveals that the probability of conducting green R&D abroad increases with the host country's stringency of environmental regulation, market size and (green) R&D intensity. Also, relatively lower wages for scientists and engineers, and stronger protection for intellectual property rights in the host country increase the likelihood for MNCs to offshore green R&D. The paper concludes by discussing the policy implications of this changing global innovation landscape. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This lack of data poses challenges on the robustness of quantitative analyses and, as a consequence, on the reliability of evidences needed, for example, to support policy-makers in policy design. This paper proposes a patent-based method to estimate R&D expenditure in the private sector. This approach is then applied to assess private R&D spending in Europe in the context of climate change mitigation technologies. Findings show that R&D strategies in Europe are both country and technology dependent.

A series of publications appeared in 1974, covering various aspects of mucidin: mode of action, antifungal spectrum, its effectiveness compared with other antibiotics, and its ability to induce morphological changes in both filamentous fungi and yeasts. Nevertheless, in 1977, German scientists described the antibiotic strobilurin A, which is identical to mucidin, and ignored the existence of mucidin.

In a difference-in-difference setting, we compare exporter characteristics in sectors intensive in intellectual property (IP) relative to non-IP-intensive sectors. We find that high-IP exports expanded along the extensive (firm-count) margin around the time of the reforms, but with the passage of time expansions along the intensive (firm size) margin took on more importance. Changes in the exporting behaviour of entrants were the key drivers, while incumbents were largely unaffected. Exporter entry and exit rates in IP-intensive sectors rose after the reforms, shifting the distribution of exporters towards larger and more IP-intensive firms. The first year survival rate of entrants was unaffected, but the destination entry rate of survivors fell.

Intangible machines: Patent protection for software in the United States,Computers; intellectual property; patents; software; USA; LAW,"Intellectual property law has been interacting with software for over sixty years. Despite this, the law in this area remains confused and uncertain: this is particularly evident in patent law. Focusing on U.S. patent law from the 1960s through to the mid-1970s, this article argues that a key reason for this confusion relates to the particular way that the subject matter was construed. While the early discussions about subject matter eligibility were framed in terms of the question is software patentable?, what was really at stake in these debates was the preliminary ontological question: what is software? Building on work that highlights the competing ways that software was construed by different parts of the information technology industry at the time, the article looks at the particular way that the law responded to these competing interpretations and how in so doing it laid the foundation for the confusion that characterizes the area. When engaging with new types of subject matter, patent law has consistently relied on the relevant techno-scientific communities not only to provide the law with a relatively clear understanding of the nature of the subject matter being considered; they have also provided the means to allow the law to describe, demarcate, and identify that new subject matter.

Weighing intellectual property: Can we balance the social costs and benefits of patenting?,Balance; innovation; patent law; patent policy; social costs and benefits of intellectual property; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; LAW,"The scale is the most famous emblem of the law, including intellectual property (IP). Because IP rights impose social costs on the public by limiting access to protected work, the law can be justified only to the extent that, on balance, it encourages enough creation and dissemination of new works to offset those costs. The scale is thus a potent rhetorical trope of fairness and objectivity, but also an instrument the law thinks with - one that is constantly invoked to justify or to question the extent of available IP protection. The balancing act that underlies the legitimacy of IP is, however, literally impossible to perform. Because we are unable to measure the benefits that IP has for inventors or the costs it has for the public, the scale has nothing to weigh. It conveys a clear sense that IP law can be balanced, but in fact propagates only a visible simulacrum of balance - one that is as empty as it is powerful.",2019,History & Philosophy of Science
Trust: A Model for Disclosure in Patent Law,; WOMEN INVENTORS; PRIVACY; TIES; PROPERTY; STRENGTH,"How to draw the line between public and private is a foundational, first principles question of privacy law, but the answer has implications for intellectual property, as well. This project is one in a series of papers about first-person disclosures of information in the privacy and intellectual property law contexts, and it defines the bound-ary between public and nonpublic information through the lens of social science -namely, principles of trust. Patent law's public use bar confronts the question of whether legal protection should extend to information previously disclosed to a small group of people. I present evidence that shows that current application of the public use bar privileges the confidentiality and control norms of industry while minimizing those no less strong norms common to lone entrepreneurs. This results in a general pattern: corporate inventors tend to win their public use cases; solo entrepreneurs tend to lose them. As a result, the public use bar has unintended negative effects, including discouraging experimentation and discriminating against inventors without the financial backing of corporate employers. These results are the direct effects of how courts determine the difference between public and nonpublic uses. This project proposes a new way of talking about, thinking through, and determining when previous disclosures bar subsequent patentability. In short, I argue that invention disclosures in contexts of trust retain their legal protection despite any ostensible loss of control or lack of formal confidentiality agreements. This proposal respects social network differences and will advance the goals of patent law and increase access to the innovation economy for all persons.",2017,Government & Law

Rate of change of TFP is proxied using an index of patent protection. The dataset used in the paper includes 25 high income countries, 20 middle income countries, 28 low income countries and 16 countries which have transitioned across income categories during the time period considered in this paper. The results of the paper, estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach, show significant differences when the rate of change of TFP is assumed to be varying as opposed to being uniform. Significantly, the rate of convergence differs significantly across the subgroups of countries under the assumption of varying rate of change of TFP. Rates of convergence under the assumption of varying rates are clearly higher than those under the uniform rate for high income countries while the results for countries in other income categories are mixed.",2018,Business & Economics

Economics of Innovation and New Technology 7 (2): 115-158] to model the relationship between appropriability mechanisms, innovation, and firm-level productivity. We enrich this model in three ways: (1) We compare estimates obtained using a broader definition of innovation spending to those that use R&D spending. (2) We assume that a firm simultaneously innovates and chooses among different appropriability methods to protect the innovation. (3) We estimate the impact of innovation output on firm productivity conditional on the choice of appropriability mechanism. We find that firms that innovate and rate formal methods for the protection of intellectual property highly are more productive than other firms, but that the same does not hold in the case of informal methods of protection, except possibly for large firms as opposed to SMEs. We also find that this result is strongest for firms in the services, trade, and utility sectors, and negative in the manufacturing sector.",2017,Business & Economics
Promotion of technological development and determination of or biotechnology trends in five selected Latin American countries: An analysis based on PCT patent applications,Argentina; Biotechnology; Brazil; Chile; Commercialization; Cuba; Development; Latin America; Mexico; Patent cooperation treaty; Patents; PCT; Technology; INNOVATION; RIGHTS,"Background: Science and technology are two desirable elements for the economic and social development of a country. Biotechnology has a particularly important potential for economic development.Nevertheless, patent production in Latin America remains underdeveloped, which creates the need to analyze its trend and the efforts made to promote patent production. Therefore, the purpose of this study was, on the one hand, to determine trends in biotechnology-related PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) applications in Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba from 1999 to 2015, and, on the other hand, to determine whether there is a relationship between the gross domestic expenditure on research and experimental development as a percentage of gross domestic product (GERD/GDP) and PCT applications for biotechnological inventions from 2007 to 2015 (in this case, the period under study was limited from 2007 to 2015, due to data availability for GERD/GDP in the five selected countries). Results: The first part of this study shows that the growth in biotechnology PCT applications has been moderate and gradual and the trend was fitted to a linear model. The second set of results shows that GERD/GDP is associated with biotechnology-related PCT applications issued during the study period with a significance level of alpha=0.01. Conclusions: Even though results indicate a gradual and modest progress, it is necessary that these five representative Latin American nations continue acting toward the protection of intellectual property in the area of biotechnology, especially by configuring strategies for further progress based on investments on research and development.

Intellectual property protection for plants: Raspberry,IP protection systems; plant variety rights; patent; raspberry; ariljska malina; ,"The production of raspberries is an important and highly valuable part of the agroindustry, which provides direct use of fruits and their application in the food processing and confectionery industry. Acceptance of plant intellectual property protection additionally influences the introduction of new development programs in this field and expansion of new products. Two approaches in plant intellectual property protection have been developed on a global level: the American approach that allows patentability for plants and the European approach that includes an exemption in relation to the patentability of plant varieties. In both cases, the protection of new varieties is regulated by a special system of variety protection. This article presents a comparison of those two plant variety protection systems and the comparison between Serbian and US raspberry production and innovation in this field, since these countries are among the five major producers of raspberries and raspberry products in the world; therefore, intellectual property protection of raspberry varieties is an especially important issue to them. The area harvested with raspberries in the United States is over 3000 ha smaller than in Serbia, but the production of this fruit is significantly higher. The continuous development of new varieties, primarily adapted to the growing conditions in US regions, has strongly increased the yield of this fruit.",2018,Agriculture
Study on the various intellectual property management strategies used and implemented by ICT firms for business intelligence,Business intelligence; competitive intelligence; IP strategies; organizational performance; patents; TECHNOLOGY; DISCLOSURE; PATENTS; INDUSTRY; MARKET,"Software technology is seeing enormous growth as it is used in all fields of technology. It is continuously evolving at a rapid pace and has a short span of the technological life cycle. The use of the software is not restricted only to information and communication technology but is used in all fields of technology. In many cases, the inventive step of a product or service lies solely in the software. Hence, the software plays a crucial role in all fields of technology. However, ease of copying poses a financial risk for the software industry, thereby creating major disincentives to the development of innovation. Still, the technology is changing very fast and firms investing in this technology expect quick returns on their innovation investments. Strategies for generating and managing intellectual property have subsequently taken center stage for information and communication technology companies, and patents have become an important feature providing maximum protection for any technology. Hence, intellectual property rights strategies in general and patenting strategies especially play a crucial role in the information and communication technology industry to be globally competitive. Firms never publish or disclose their intellectual property strategies; hence, this study makes use of the literature review to highlight various intellectual property management strategies used by information and communication technology firms for managing their intellectual property. These strategies can be offensive or defensive and may be used as proactive or reactive depending on various aspects such as market, territory, technology, or time. The insights provided in this work may help the research community from the IT domain in industry and academia to learn and modify their strategies for patent acquisition.",2019,Business & Economics

Copyright Protection and Cumulative Creation: Evidence from Early Twentieth-Century Music,; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PATENTS; INNOVATION; IMPACT,"This paper uses data from an online database of music sampling to estimate the effect of copyright protection on the cumulative use of music. Using unique panel data that link upstream and downstream music, I use regression analysis to examine the rates at which early 20th-century musical works were used throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. The results suggest that copyright protection causes an upstream work to be used less than half as often as it would be if it were in the public domain after conditioning on upstream-song and downstream-year fixed effects. Placebo regressions in which the copyright expiration date is artificially shifted forward and backward in time by 2, 5, and 10 years suggest an immediate effect of copyright expiration on downstream use.",2018,Government & Law
How will recent trade agreements that extend market protections for brand-name prescription pharmaceuticals impact expenditures and generic access in Canada?,Pharmaceutical policy; Globalization and health; Health care reform; Drug pricing; Health spending; International trade; Patents; Data exclusivities; Health law; EXCLUSIVITY; DRUGS; TIME,"Canada recently entered into two multinational trade agreements (i.e., the Canada, United States, and Mexico Trade Agreement: and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union). The resulting federal policy changes will prolong periods of market protection afforded to eligible brand-name prescription drugs by extending competition-blocking patent and data exclusivity terms. While previous studies have analysed these two policy changes in isolation, it remains unknown what the total combined impact will be in a typical year. Our objective was to design an analytic approach that can assess more than one change to a country's market protections and then to apply this methodology to the Canadian context. We find that the collective impact of these policy changes will be to extend the regulatory protection period for new drugs from an average of 10.0 years to 11.1 years. Depending upon the model's assumptions and all contingencies considered, an 11% increase equated to an average of $410 million annually (with a minimum estimate of $40 million and a maximum of $1.4 billion). Despite this uncertainty reflected in the range of possible financial impacts, we conclude that such methodological approaches could be useful for rapidly evaluating potential policy changes prior to adoption, which may further assist in budget planning to mitigate increased cost to the downstream health authorities most impacted by these trade concessions.

Those that did are tied to the foundations of our society through their role in facilitating innovation and consumer protection.

What shown and discussed in this contribution supports the proposition that firm age matters in how CG may alter innovation.",2018,Business & Economics
Effects and Perspectives of Chinese Patent Medicines for Tonifying Qi and Promoting Blood Circulation on Patients with Cerebral Infarction,Cerebral infarction; tonifying qi and promoting blood circulation; chinese patent medicine; review; STROKE; METAANALYSIS,"Background and Objectives: Stroke is a disease with high morbidity, disability, and fatality. Since ischemic stroke is the most common kind of stroke, increasing attention has been paid to its prevention and treatment. Given the limitations of conventional medicine, there is growing interest in Chinese Medicine (CM), especially Chinese Patent Medicine (CPM) for its convenience and stability. Studies of CM show that Chinese Patent Medicines for Tonifying Qi and Promoting Blood Circulation (CPMs-TQPBC) are one of the most common and effective categories of all clinical CPMs in China. Methods: This review investigated and summarized the randomized controlled trials (RCT) of CPMs-TQPBC combined with conventional interventions in the last 10 years. Results: Trial results demonstrated the potential in reducing the endpoints and improving neurologic impairments, body movements, Barthel index, quality of life, and certain biomarkers. Furthermore, certain CM syndromes were alleviated with rare adverse events. Advantages of interventions combined with CPMs-TQPBC for patients with cerebral infarction were discovered. Compared with the Chinese patent medicines for promoting blood circulation (CPMs-PBC) alone, CPMs for both tonifying qi and promoting blood circulation exhibited noticeably better effects. The underlying reasons could be related to the improvement of microcirculation in the brain, protection against ischemic reperfusion injury, generation of neuroprotective factors, and inhibition of apoptosis. Conclusion: Under the circumstances of qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome (QDBSS) (Qixu-Xueyu Zheng), CPMs-TQPBC showed a substantial difference. More trials focusing on specific patient groups should be carried out to corroborate and expand the findings.",2015,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology

Does intellectual property right promote innovations when pirates are innovators?,Intellectual Property Rights; R&D incentive of imitators; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; PATENTS; IMITATION,"We identify two new channels through which Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) may affect R&D incentives that are in stark contrast to conventional wisdom. First, in a model with a simple technology we find that IPRs may deter innovations when pirates are potential innovators. Second, in a model with a complex technology we find that IPR, even in a static situation, increases consumer surplus. We show that strong IPRs lead not only to the decrease in the competition effect, but also the increase in the innovation effect in the current period when there exists international specialization in R&D. When innovation effect dominates competition effect, the strengthening of patent protection promotes both innovation and consumer surplus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We estimate the likelihood of engaging in R&D as a function of a firm's distance from the relevant technological frontier and of the country's IPRs system. In line with previous literature, we find that (i) firms closer to the technological frontier are more likely to engage in formal R&D activities and (ii) stronger IPRs systems, because they protect returns from R&D activities from imitation, are more effective in promoting investment in R&D. Moreover, when the strength of an IPRs system interacts with the distance to the technological frontier, its effect is no longer significant, ceteris paribus. This is the most striking result of our study. When we examine the semi-elasticity of the strength of IPRs with respect to a firm's distance from the technological frontier, a weak yet positive impact on the firm's likelihood to engage in R&D is observed for very inefficient ones, whereas this becomes negative and weakly significant when firms are on the technological frontier.",2016,Business & Economics

Using the panel data of 92 countries during 1970-2007, I conclude from the system generalised method of moments estimation that domestic investment share, FDI, R&D capacity, openness to trade, human capital and IPRs protection all have statistically significant and positive impacts on economic growth. A further investigation of countries at different levels of development suggests two striking findings. First, besides the domestic investment, openness, human capital and IPRs protection, R&D is the key to drive economic growth in the higher-income countries, while FDI is the engine of growth in both higher-income and middle-income countries. Second, a positive and significant impact of IPRs protection on economic growth is found in both higher-income and lower-income countries.

The authors' main hypothesis is that by creating a form of non-market protection, IPP limits free competition and has no positive effects on national economies and the world economy in general. The hypothesis is tested through estimation of relationship between charges for the use of intellectual property and 1) gross domestic product, 2) GDP growth, 3) unemployment, 4) exports of high-tech products, 5) FDI outflow, and 6) expenses on research and development in a panel dataset of 146 countries in years 2005-2014 based Arellano-Bond estimator for dynamic panel models.

Due to the subsidiary mandate in the host country being categorized as exploitation-orientation or exploration-orientation, we further examine whether there is a different moderating effect for different types of a subsidiary mandate. This analysis takes advantage of the data-set on Taiwan-based subsidiaries and the IPR indices by the World Economic Forum over the 2006-2009 period. The empirical results show that a stronger degree of IPR protection is, on average, found to play a significant moderating role in the influence of R&D outsourcing strategy based on local collaboration relationships.

This quality-ladder model features innovative R&D in the North and imitative R&D in the South. Two types of innovations are considered: innovation targeting all products and innovation targeting only imitated products. We find that for both types of innovations, strengthening IPR protection reduces the innovation rate and raises the imitation rate. There is also an increase in the proportion of Northern unskilled labor and a decrease in Northern wage inequality.

Does stronger intellectual property rights protection foster structural change? Effects of heterogeneity in innovations,C02; L0; O31; PRODUCT; LIFE; GROWTH,"This paper studies the question how changes in intellectual property rights (IPR) regime affect relative innovation intensity for multinational large enterprises (MNEs) and local firms. The R&D process is doubly-differentiated, allowing both for variety-expanding and productivity-improving innovations. The IPR regime is abstracted as an effective duration of patent protection. From one side stronger IPR foster R&D activities of the MNE, which is in agreement with other findings. From the other side the local innovative activity is threatened by stronger protection. Depending on technical characteristics of the underlying R&D processes, the strengthening of the uniform one-size-fits-all IPR creates productivity bias or variety bias. Moreover, if technologies are heterogeneous, this bias varies over time implying the necessity of technology-specific heterogeneous IPR protection regimes to foster structural change and avoid technology lock-ins.

To date human IMPDH inhibitors have been approved for prevention of organ transplant rejection and as anti-viral agents. More recently, the use of IMPDH inhibitors for other indications including cancer and pathogenic microorganisms has been pursued. Areas covered: IMPDH inhibitors disclosed primarily in the patent and scientific literature from 2002 to the present are discussed. Several interesting chemotypes that have not been pursued by patent protection are also highlighted. Expert opinion: Progress has been made in the development of IMPDH inhibitors, particularly compounds that are structurally distinct from mycophenolic acid and nucleoside-based inhibitors. However, clinical progression has been hampered primarily by a limited understanding of the enzyme's role in disease pathophysiology. Finally, most of the IMPDH inhibitors developed over the past fourteen years fall within a relatively narrow set of chemotypes. This provides opportunities for expanding IMPDH inhibitor chemical space to further evaluate this class of molecular targets.",2017,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

This has led to an increasing need for innovation indicators that reflect the implementation of knowledge within innovative products and services. Standardization as a kind of open innovation process, and standards as its output, represents a new type of innovation indicator. In this chapter, we begin with a discussion of existing opportunities for using standards and standardization as innovation indicators, including three specific examples of input, throughput, and output indicators. Next we identify challenges that must be addressed to close the data gaps-which are still very significant when compared with patent data. In addition, the broader concept of quality infrastructure is introduced in order to point out the complexity of standards implementation, and its close link to innovation as well. The chapter concludes with examples of how decision makers in industry and policy could make use of a comprehensive database of standardization and standards to evaluate innovation policy initiatives.",2019,Computer Science

In this paper, we address this question from both a moral philosophical and a legal point of view. We argue that philosophical theories about property do not seem to support a positive answer: We have not mixed our labour with our genes, and the human genome cannot be said to be a fitting object for private ownership based on some idea of self-ownership. An analysis of the term property' as seen from a legal perspective yields the conclusion that property is, at best, a linguistic prop whose real content has to be defined at least partially conventionally. Relevant interests that may be seen to be protected seem to be interests of privacy or interests against exploitation. To the extent that the logic behind the patent system holds true limiting incentives decreases innovation in society. A balancing of interest must take place, and we have to make sure that patent protection serves general societal interests and not just those of special interest groups be that inventors or donors.",2019,Genetics & Heredity

On the one hand, this article takes a broad legal approach to their presence in the Spanish legal system, showing that they provide two types of protection: a civil protection, through the Unfair Competition Law, and a criminal protection, through the Criminal Code, which includes criminal responsibility for legal persons. Each of these two types of protection has particular features, but they are almost identical, as they punish, although with different legal consequences, the same actions against trade secrets. On the other hand, the purpose of this paper is also to explore the connection between trade secrets and intellectual property rights, specifically patent rights. Both kinds of intangibles share many aspects and the international legal instruments confirm it, but their main difference is the instrument of protection: while intellectual property rights receive protection through their registration, trade secrets have to be safeguarded through specific measures adopted by their holder in order to keep their confidentiality. From this difference others are derived, but, despite their existence, they work as supplementary systems.",2016,Government & Law
The complementary effect of intellectual property protection mechanisms on product innovation performance,; KNOWLEDGE; APPROPRIABILITY; PATENTS; APPROPRIATION; COLLABORATION; PARADOX,"This study assessed the effect of simultaneous implementations of different intellectual property (IP) protection mechanisms on a firm's product innovation performance (PIP). The study categorized seven widely-used IP protection mechanisms (IPPMs) into two groups: formal and informal. Complementarity was then tested within and between the formal and informal groups of IPPMs. The result showed that there existed complementarity when multiple IPPMs were implemented from the same groups. Throughout an additional analysis on the moderating effect of the industrial complexity in technology, it was found that the between groups' combination effect was also existed but varied from even negative to positive concluding that industrial complexity of technology moderates the effects of combinations of IPPMs on a firm's PIP. These results imply that the use of multiple IPPMs is effective but the effect varies by the technological complexity of industry.",2018,Business & Economics
How Private Property Protection Influences the Impact of Intellectual Property Rights on Economic Growth?,private property protection; quantile regression; economic growth; Intellectual property rights; QUANTILE REGRESSION; PATENT PROTECTION; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; INNOVATION; COUNTRIES; FLOWS; LAWS; FDI,"Abstract Although policy-makers typically assume a positive relationship between intellectual property rights (IPRs) and economic growth, the empirical evidence on the IPR-growth relationship is rather inconclusive. We conjecture in this paper that the weak IPR-growth evidence in previous studies may be due to a neglect of the role of finance markets and private property rights. Our conjecture is motivated by the recent law-and-finance literature. We test our conjecture with a cross-section of 98 countries and find that once we modify our measure of IPRs to take into account general property rights, there is stronger evidence for a positive relationship between IPRs and economic growth. Our findings not only help explain the IPR-innovation puzzle but also have significant theoretical as well as policy implications.",2015,Business & Economics

The innovation in wind power technologies is vital to achieving a transformation of energy structure. The study sought to investigate the effects of policies (feed-in tariffs and research and development spending), their interaction, wind power deployment and electricity prices on wind power technology innovation at the provincial level in China, based on negative binomial fixed effect regression model and provincial panel data from 2006 to 2016. The following conclusions are drawn from the findings: (1) demand-pull policies through feed-in tariff policy promote innovation in wind power technologies; (2) higher feed-in tariffs of wind power induce greater stock of patents in wind technologies; (3) technology-push policies through research and development spending support wind power technological innovation; (4) only research and development funding investment in industrial enterprises under the implementation of feed-in tariff policy can stimulate greater patent stock due to the fact that the wind power industry enterprises are gainers for feed-in tariff policy, indicating that there is an interaction effect; (5) improving the wind power deployment drives wind power technology patents; (6) increasing electricity prices will incentivize innovation of wind power manufacturers in order to reduce cost and obtain more profit.",2019,Energy & Fuels; Engineering
Knowledge Protection in Firms: A Conceptual Framework and Evidence from HP Labs,Secrecy; information security; organization design; trust; innovation; appropriability mechanisms; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TRADE SECRETS; RELATIONAL CONTRACTS; TRUST; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; INNOVATION; PATENTS; APPROPRIABILITY; CONSEQUENCES,"This paper proposes a simple framework to examine organizational methods of knowledge protection. The framework highlights a basic trade-off between improving decision-making and innovation through communication and mitigating security risks by imposing restrictions on communication flows. The trade-off is mediated by factors such as the sensitivity of information, the degree to which employees can be trusted to handle sensitive information appropriately, and firms' investments in legal protection mechanisms. Evidence from HP Labs supports the basic predictions of the model, in particular the importance of employee trustworthiness and internalized codes of behavior in promoting open communication. Our interviews also suggest a potential conflict between two of the most important appropriability mechanisms: secrecy and lead-time advantage.",2019,Business & Economics
"Technology, Market Regulations, and Labor Share Dynamics",Labor share; Technological change; ICT capital; Market regulations; Hysteresis; FORCE PARTICIPATION; PATENT RIGHTS; INSTITUTIONS,"We investigate the causes of the decline in the labor share, exploring the effect of technology vis-a-vis the role of market regulations, namely employment protection legislation, product market regulation, and intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. Our results show that, in the long run, productivity upgrades and information and communication technology capital diffusion are major sources of the decline in the labor share. IPR protection is the only dimension of the institutional setting that affects (positively) the share of industry income accruing to labor. Our results also show that hysteresis characterizes the dynamics of the labor share in all countries. This further corroborates the idea that institutional differences are not the main source of variation in labor share movements, as the negative trend is common to countries with different regulatory settings.",2019,Area Studies; Business & Economics
The Effect of Intellectual Property Rights Protection on the International Competitiveness of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry in China,High-Tech Industry; Pharmaceutical Manufacturing; Intellectual Property Rights; Industrial Competitiveness; Technological Innovation; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PATENT RIGHTS; TRADE; DETERMINANTS; INVESTMENT; INNOVATION; ADVANTAGE; COUNTRIES,"Research on the relationship between intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and economic growth and innovation has often been explored. However, there is an absence of research dealing with the relationship between IPR protection and the international competitiveness of high-tech industries, especially the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. This study aims to examine the impact of the strength of IPR protection on the international competitiveness of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, by using time series data from 1995 to 2014. A modified Ginarte-Park (GP) index is used to measure the strength of IPR protection, while the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index is used to measure the international competitiveness of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. A multivariate time series model and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation are employed to examine the relationship between IPR protection and the RCA index. The results show that strict IPR protection does not enhance the international competitiveness of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. The finding suggests that it is more appropriate to adopt a more relaxed IPR protection system for the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China. The finding may also provide a reference for countries which have similar backgrounds.",2018,Business & Economics

Capturing value from business models: the role of formal and informal protection strategies,business model; business model innovation; intellectual property; strategy; innovation; value capture; PAY-PER-USE; VALUE CREATION; INNOVATION; PATENTS; FIRMS; APPROPRIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; PARADOX; SECRECY,"As an overarching concept a business model describes how a firm creates and captures value for itself, its customers, and its partners. Although research has highlighted the importance of value creation and capture of business models, it primarily focused on the value creation mechanisms and neglected aspects of value capturing: Until to date, little is known about how firms attempt to protect their business models from competition, which is a critical component of value capture. Drawing on a sample of 24 cases, we explore how business models relate to IP protection mechanisms for value capture and derive a business model protection framework. Our empirical study reveals that the choice of IP protection is contingent on the applied business model. Whereas some razor and blade business models are characterised by a high degree of both formal and informal protection, firms operating franchising business models put higher emphasis on informal protection strategies. Firms running the pay-per-use business model or the multi-sided platform business model apply formal and informal protection strategies to a medium degree in order to capture value. Our findings extend business model literature on novel insights on intellectual property management and also extend the 'profiting from innovation literature' on protection mechanisms in the context of business models.",2017,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science
The Effects of Intellectual Property Rights on Access to Medicines and Catastrophic Expenditure,intellectual property right; access to medicines; TRIPS; catastrophic expenditure; PATENT PROTECTION; HEALTH-CARE; TRIPS-PLUS; IMPACT; DRUGS; ECONOMY,"Since the introduction of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in 1995, there has been considerable concern that poor access to essential medicines in developing countries would be exacerbated because strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) leads to monopoly of pharmaceutical markets and delayed entry of lower-cost generic drugs. However, despite extensive research and disputes regarding this issue, there are few empirical studies on the topic. In this study, we investigated the effect of IPR on access to medicines and catastrophic expenditure for medicines, using data from World Health Surveys 2002-2003. The index of patent rights developed by Ginarte and Park (1997) was used to measure the IPR protection level of each country. Estimates were adjusted for individual and country characteristics. In the results of multilevel logistic regression analyses, higher level of IPR significantly increased the likelihood of nonaccess to prescribed medicines even after controlling for individual socioeconomic status and national characteristics associated with access to medicines. This study's finding on the negative impact of IPR on access to medicines calls for the implementation of more active policy at the supra-national level to improve access in low- and middle-income countries.",2015,Health Care Sciences & Services

Building on and extending the knowledge management, institutional theory and expatriate literatures, this article explores whether home country expatriates can substitute for weak IP protection and drive an increase in more and more valuable knowledge transfers to foreign operations located in weak IP protection countries. Because of their ties to headquarters, knowledge of parent firm assets, priorities and routines, and activities in local operations, I argue that home country expatriates can transform the local operation to offer higher protection for parent firm knowledge in weak IP countries in ways that local managers cannot. The results from a comprehensive panel of US multinationals suggest that home country expatriates can substitute for weak IP protection, but that this effect is contingent on the manufacturing and knowledge capabilities of foreign operations for higher value parent firm knowledge transfers. Overall, this article extends our understanding of the global management and protection of knowledge by MNCs by exploring how organizational practices can buffer country-level institutional deficiencies for firm knowledge.",2017,Business & Economics
Ministernotomy aortic valve surgery in patients with prior patent mammary artery grafts after coronary artery bypass grafting,Ministernotomy; Aortic valve; Reoperative; Patent mammary grafts; SHORT-TERM; REPLACEMENT; OUTCOMES; STERNOTOMY,"OBJECTIVES Patients with patent internal thoracic artery (ITA) grafts after prior coronary artery bypass grafting surgery who require aortic valve replacement (AVR) pose unique technical challenges for safe and optimal myocardial protection. The purpose of this study is to review our short- and long-term outcomes with redo minimally invasive AVR in patients with patent in situ ITA grafts. METHODS From 2008 to 2016, 48 patients with at least 1 patent in situ mammary artery graft underwent minimally invasive AVR. Preoperative computed tomography was performed in all patients to evaluate the relationship of patent grafts to the sternum. Retrograde coronary sinus and pulmonary vent catheters were placed via the right internal jugular vein. The in situ ITA grafts were not clamped during AVR. Transverse aortotomy, taking care to avoid the grafts arising from the aorta, was performed to expose the aortic valve. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 78years [Quartile 1 (Q1)-Quartile 3 (Q3): 71-81]. Thirty-nine (81%) patients were men, and 46 (96%) patients had aortic stenosis. The median cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times were 124 (Q1-Q3: 108-164) and 92 (Q1-Q3: 83-116) min, respectively. Moderate hypothermia at 28-30 degrees C was used in all patients. Most patients received cold blood cardioplegia with antegrade induction and continuous retrograde delivery. Four patients received only retrograde delivery due to some degree of aortic insufficiency. Thirty-day mortality was 4% (2 of 48 patients). There was no conversion to full sternotomy, and no reoperations were performed for postoperative bleeding or sternal wound infection. Excluding the 2 patients who died in the hospital, the median postoperative length of stay was 7 days (Q1-Q3: 5-8). Overall survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 94%, 87% and 44%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous retrograde cardioplegia combined with antegrade cardioplegia and moderate hypothermia, without interruption of ITA flow, is a safe and reliable strategy in patients with patent ITA grafts undergoing aortic valve replacement. This strategy combined with a minimally invasive approach may reduce surgical trauma, and is a safe and effective technique in these challenging patients.",2019,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery

Intuitively, stronger IPR protection attracts more FDI in countries with small informal economies but not in countries with large informal economies. The intuition is that the informal economy is a proxy for the quality of institutions. In institutionally strong countries, IPR protection promotes FDI by reducing illegal imitation and freeing up more resources for MNCs. Our empirical analysis, based on a threshold effect model, provides some evidence supportive of our model. (C) 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Managing collaborative ideation: the role of formal and informal appropriability mechanisms,Open innovation; Collaborative ideation; Collaboration phases; appropriability mechanisms; Intellectual property; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; OPEN INNOVATION; APPROPRIATION MECHANISMS; OPEN STRATEGY; KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; OPENNESS; PARADOX; PATENTS,"Collaborative ideation is a key practice for innovation. Implementing suitable appropriability mechanisms during this collaborative ideation is a necessary yet difficult task. This difficulty owes to a high level of uncertainty and low level of codification because partners work on loosely defined concepts that may change during the collaboration. Firms can employ several appropriability mechanisms to protect their knowledge. Examples include patents, copyright, legal agreements, document management, lead time, secrecy and complexity. However, the best time to apply each mechanism remains unclear, and few empirical studies have explored this issue. This study is based on exploratory case studies of three manufacturing firms. The goal is to identify which appropriability mechanisms are pertinent at each phase of collaborative ideation and how they influence the effectiveness of protection. The results of the analysis lead to the development of a model describing the managerial practices that influence the effectiveness of protection. The results also lead to a set of research propositions to define when each appropriability mechanism is most likely to be used. Overall, this research contributes to the discussion of how to integrate formal and informal appropriability mechanisms for safe collaborative ideation.",2019,Business & Economics

We show that a tariff on foreign products can influence the licensing strategy of the foreign firm. There is a trade-off between a tariff and a royalty license in affecting the product price. We show in particular that a tariff can be chosen so as to induce fee licensing and maximize both consumers' surplus and domestic welfare. This resolves the so-called conflict between these two objectives in respect of the choice of a tariff. The paper provides a number of testable hypothesis.,2017,Business & Economics
