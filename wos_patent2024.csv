The law applicable to the right of priority from a European perspective,right of priority; patents; Paris convention; European Patent Convention; TRIPS; applicable law; ,"The right of priority established in the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property allows a patent applicant to claim the filing date of a first application for any subsequent applications for the same invention filed within twelve months in another Paris Convention Contracting State. This right may be claimed by the person who has filed an application or their successor in title. If priority is not validly claimed, patent applications and patents relying on the right may be rejected, revoked or invalidated. National and regional rules governing who may claim priority, whether a priority right may be divided or shared, whether it may be transferred independently of the priority application and the rights to the invention, and the requirements for a valid transfer differ from country to country. The issue of whether priority has been validly claimed may therefore depend on which country's law applies, which depends on the characterisation of the issues. The aim of this article is to provide a European perspective on the law applicable to the right of priority.",2024,Government & Law,1
"The devil is in the divisional: an analysis of divisional patents, deadlines, declarations and suggestions for future practice",; ,"center dot This article argues that divisional patent applications and litigation are strategically employed in the pharmaceutical sector to delay generic and biosimilar market entry. These practices are given a legitimate basis in the European Patent Convention and the Patents Act 1977, but recent UK case law shows that their misuse results in deliberate obfuscation of existing safeguards. center dot Nonetheless, patent law should not be passive. The reintroduction of the divisional filing time limit coupled with shorter compliance periods would offer practical administrative steps for shortening the time frame within which divisionals can be filed. Moreover, further clarity surrounding the implementation of the double patenting prohibition would reduce the number of substantially similar divisional patents that are successfully obtained. center dot This article also discusses Arrow declarations at length, before concluding with a brief analysis of the suitability of the abuse of process doctrine for dealing with divisional misuse.",2024,Government & Law,1
Incorporation of competition-related TRIPS flexibilities in the domestic law: A case study of India,competition law; Indian patents act; patent thicket; TRIPS flexibilities; ,"Abuse of patent rights can hit the three pillars of the competition law viz., agreements, abuse of dominant position and combination (mergers and acquisitions). In the context of the interface between competition law and patented inventions, the following acts can strike hard at the different pillars of competition law. First, the licensing agreements containing conditions, which may prevent competition, can attract the provisions of competition law to regulate agreements. Second, high prices on patented products can be treated as an abuse of dominant position. Third, refusal to license an intellectual property right may be anticompetitive under certain conditions such as refusing to license the second/dependent patent over the existing patented invention, and refusal on reasonable terms to the competitors. The TRIPS Agreement does contain flexibilities offering remedies to address the public interest aspects including the abuse of patents. This paper examines the implementation of competition law-related flexibilities in the Indian Patents Act and the Competition Act in the context of pharmaceutical product patents. It argues that though competition law flexibilities are incorporated in both statutes, there is further scope for optimising the scope of these flexibilities.",2020,Government & Law,1
The Herchel Smith Intellectual Property Lecture 2022*The UK courts' striving for consistency with international decisions in patent law,European Patent Convention; Unified Patent Court; patent claim scope; law of precedent; patent law international cooperation; ,"The Patents Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court (before that, the House of Lords) have all and for many years stressed the need for consistency with decisions of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO. They have also taken account of decisions of the national courts of other EPC member states on many occasions in pursuit of consistency, in relation to validity but also infringement. This lecture will consider: how this has been done; when it has worked well and less well; how it can and should work if the EPO (in particular) changes or develops its law differently from the UK; and how that fits with the law of precedent. It will also consider the issues that may arise with decisions under the UPC.",2024,Government & Law,1
REWARDING PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION FOR BEING INNOVATIVE: A SUMMARY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL PATENT SYSTEM AND AN AMENDMENT TO THE PATENT ACT TO NEGATE EVERGREENING AND PATENT THICKETS,; ,"This article proposes an amendment to the Patent Act that discourages anti-competitive patent practices in the pharmaceutical industry without interfering with follow-on innovation. It begins by introducing the pharmaceutical industry and its reliance on patents. It then explores pharmaceutical follow-on innovations that amount to secondary patents and the arising issues of evergreening and patent thickets. While follow-on innovation is imperative to public health and a natural outcome of pharmaceutical innovation, the secondary patents essential to encourage such innovation are being used gratuitously, likely representing anti-competitive strategies. Next, this article analyzes comparative law that has addressed these anti-competitive concerns, the inadequacy of this comparative law, and advocates that patentability standards should not be heightened to combat anti-competitive patent strategy. Finally, the article analyzes Canadian case law on the doctrine of selection patents to draw inspiration for a Patent Act amendment designed to thwart anti-competitive patent practice without impairing genuine and benecial follow-on innovation.",2024,Government & Law,1
Patents and unjustified threats-Legal solutions in Australia,Australia; intellectual property; patents; unjustified threats; ,"While intellectual property laws protect rights holders from infringement of their intellectual property, these laws also protect against abuse of those rights where rights holders unjustifiably threaten competitors with infringement proceedings. The introduction of additional damages for flagrant unjustified threats under the recent Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Productivity Commission Response Part 1 and Other Measures) Act 2018 (Cth) may benefit an alleged infringer who is not found to have infringed a valid patent. In particular, new section 128(1A) to the Patents Act 1990 allows additional damages to be awarded against a person for making blatant unjustified threats of infringing a patent. In cases where it is difficult to determine the loss and ordinary damages cannot be awarded, a court could award a nominal amount in compensation, but the difficulty lies in whether, in some cases, damages can be awarded at all. This raises the need to consider other legal avenues to address the issue of unjustified threats relating to patented inventions. In this paper we have identified four such other legal avenues being: specific provisions of the Australian Consumer Law; the misuse of market power provisions in s 46 Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth); the duty of care and diligence in s 180 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth); and the law of joint tortfeasorship. Each of these potential legal solutions will be examined in turn however a comparison of remedies, or interactions with the laws of evidence, and exploration of costs are beyond the scope of this analysis. Further while we acknowledge that other Australian legislation provides a cause of action arising from the making of unjustifiable threats, such as in the Copyright Act 1968, the Trade Marks Act 1995, the Designs Act 2003 and the Circuit Layouts Act 1986, this paper is focused on the Patents Act 1990 only.",2024,Government & Law,1
THE MORAL CLAUSE IN PATENT LAW AND THREATS POSED BY HUMAN GERMLINE GENOME EDITING,Human Genome; Moratorium; Moral Clause in Patent Law; Mexico; ,"This article examines whether the lack of closure of moral clauses in patent laws, particularly in dealing with the issue of human germline genome editing, causes such clauses to fail to function as a moratorium in countries like Mexico. The hypothesis posed here is that a general, open, moral clause in intellectual property legislation, specifically in patent law, is ineffective when confronted with a foreseeable but strong innovation that alters an area of applied biology such as human germline genome editing. Using the deductive method, this research aims to determine whether countries like Mexico need to provide more specific guidance in their legislation on technological innovations like human germline modification in order to foster an atmosphere of legal certainty. A comparative analysis of the closed morals clause in the European Patent Convention and the open morals clause in Mexico's intellectual property law confirms this hypothesis. Specifically, the lack of closure of a morals clause in patent law, when confronted with novel and complex technological advances, will likely fail to function as a moratorium.",2021,Government & Law,1
What's Your Move?

"MEDICINE AND COLONIAL PATENT LAW IN INDIA: A Study of Patent Medicines and the Indian Patents and Designs Act, 1911 in Early- Twentieth-Century India",Patent Medicines; History of Patent Law; History of Medicines; History of Drug Regulation; Colonialism; History of South Asia; History of law; Cultural nationalism; Business History; ,"This paper investigates the history of drugs sold as patent medicines in India in the early twentieth century. The paper investigates their legitimacy as patenting of medicines was forbidden by the Indian Patents and Designs Act, 1911 (IPDA). The paper argues that the instrument of letters patents functioning as the prerogative of the Crown that gave monopolistic rights to grantees to sell any compound without having to disclose its constituents was the reason behind this seemingly conflicting historical relationship between the law and the market. Colonial law-making left sufficient space within the ambit of the IPDA for letters patents to have their ill effects. The colonial state made attempts to address this as a public health issue by incorporating concerns related to this class of medicines within regulations addressed to the drugs market in the 1930s. The currency of patent medicines in the market was further added to by Indian indigenous entrepreneurs fueled by cultural nationalism of Swadeshi ideology in Bengal in the early twentieth century. However, even such indigenous responses or attempts at hybridization of manufacturing and selling practices related to patent medicines were mostly informed by upper-caste/ upper-class interests and not so much by those of consumers of these medicines.",2020,Health Care Sciences & Services; History & Philosophy of Science,1
Historical account of dwindling national flexibilities from the Paris Convention to post-TRIPS era: What implications for access-to-medicines in low-and-middle-income-countries?,access to medicines; COVID-19; international patent law history; low-and-middle-income-countries; Paris Convention; TRIPS Agreement; TRIPS flexibilities; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PATENTS; POLICIES; TRADE,"It is arguable that the most significant feature of the maiden Paris Convention is the creation of a remarkably broad national policy space which allowed Union members to balance the implementation of required obligations with the need to occasionally attend to national exigencies. Thus, a member may choose not to offer industrial property protection if national interests would be best served by doing so. While subsequent revisions to the Paris Convention chipped away at national flexibilities, the most strident attack to national flexibilities occurs under the Agreement for the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the period after it. This paper puts the almost-unnoticed whittling down of national flexibilities in international patent agreements in historical perspective. It subsequently discusses four ways through which this development could exacerbate access-to-medicines in low-and-middle-income-countries.",2022,Government & Law,1
Revisiting the patent regime of Bangladesh: compatibility with TRIPS and international best practices,; ,"Bangladesh inherited the Patents and Designs Act, 1911, from the British and retained it for over a century with no substantial amendments. However, as a least developed country (LDC), Bangladesh will be required to comply with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement after the expiry of its transitional waiver upon graduation from the LDC status in 2026. Against this backdrop, Bangladesh has enacted a new patent law, the Bangladesh Patents Act, 2022, in an effort to make the local patent provisions responsive to the needs of innovators and con-sumers. This article examines the new patent law to assess its compliance with the TRIPS Agree-ment. To this aim, the article compares the patent pro-visions of the 2022 Act with the patent regime of other developing countries, like India and Brazil, and analyses how these countries use the treaty provisions to meet the interest of intellectual prop-erty owners and users. Lastly, the article suggests some plausible solutions for Bangladesh.",2023,Government & Law,1
Revisiting the working of patent requirements under Indian patent law,local working requirement; TRIPS Agreement; Indian Patent Act; human rights; patent working disclosures; RIGHTS; TRIPS,"This article aims to analyse the working of patent requirements under Indian patent law. A patent working requirement generally entails that the patentee must work or apply the patented product in the patent granting country. This article evaluates the compatibility of the patent working requirement with the TRIPS Agreement from the perspective of international human rights law. A human rights approach suggests that the rights of the patentee must be reconciled with the interests of the general public. In such pursuance, this article argues that there is a need to recalibrate the patent working requirement under the Indian law to strike a right balance between the rights of the patentee and the public interest. Particularly, this article argues that India must modify the present patent working disclosure requirements to ensure that foreign patentees are able to do business in India without bureaucratic hassles.",2021,Government & Law,1
Patent Accidents: Questioning Strict Liability in Patent Law,; INDEPENDENT INVENTION; PROPERTY; RETHINKING; DEFENSE; RULES,"Accidental infringement of patent rights is a pervasive and growing problem in the Information Age. As IP rights proliferate and expand in scope, it is becoming increasingly easy for companies and individuals to inadvertently infringe patents. When such accidental infringement occurs, patent law holds the infringer strictly liable. This contrasts with many areas of tort law where defendants are only liable if they act negligently. This Article questions the normative desirability of strict liability in patent law. Assuming the primary value of patent law is utilitarian, this Article poses the research question: what liability rule will maximize social welfare? This Article answers the question theoretically by applying economic models of accidents developed in tort law literature. The research finds that a negligence rule is preferable. Unlike strict liability, negligence liability will encourage both patentees and technology users to take reasonable measures to prevent accidental infringement, and thus minimize the social cost of patent accidents. Therefore, this Article recommends reforms to the liability rule in direct patent infringement cases. Defendants should be liable for accidental patent infringement only when they fail to adopt reasonable care to avoid the infringement.",2020,Government & Law,1
Incorporating Article 31bis Flexibilities on Trips Public Health into Domestic Patent System: The Inescapable Way Forward for Malaysia,Article 31bis; compulsory licence (CL); Patents Act 1983 (PA); public health flexibilities; TRIPS Agreement; ACCESS,"The main purpose of this study is to highlight the absence of specific provisions on public health under Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement that were not incorporated into the Patents Act 1983 in Malaysia. The main research question of this study is; why should Malaysia immediately amend its Patents Act 1983 to incorporate these flexibilities? Malaysia must develop effective strategies to implement policies, law and governance in managing the country's public health system. This is to ensure that the balance of rights between intellectual property owners and the public is maintained at all times. This study employs a qualitative research methodology that is based on primary sources such as the TRIPS Agreement and the Patents Act 1983, and is further supported by secondary sources such as journals and the contents of authorities' websites. This study is limited to the issues related to public health and patents. This study includes a discussion on the provisions related to patents and public health, proposed amendments to the Patents Act 1983 that should incorporate the provisions from Article 31bis, and a conclusion was presented on the importance of immediately amending the Patent Act 1983 to incorporate these provisions, particularly during the current Covid-19 pandemic. This study proposes that the amendments must be made to Section 84 of the Patents Act 1983 with respect to Rights of Government, and not through the compulsory licence mechanism under Part X of the Patents Act 1983. Thus, this study concludes that currently, Malaysia is unable to implement the provisions under Article 31bis, unless the Patents Act 1983 is amended.",2020,International Relations,1
"Protection of patent law objects, created by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies",patent law; invention; patentability; human inventor; artificial intelligence (AI) inventor; ,"The aim of the article is to solve the scientific problem of outlining the issue of protection of patent law objects created using artificial intelligence technologies, and to establish whether it is possible to recognize artificial intelligence technologies as inventor at the present stage of development of legal systems. Philosophical, comparative-legal and system-structural methods were used in the research process. Based on the analysis of the European Patent Convention, the main generally accepted conditions of patentability of the invention are determined: novelty, inventive step, industrial applicability. It has been established that inventions created by artificial intelligence technologies will meet such criteria provided that certain requirements are met. In the context of the study, the case of the invention of artificial intelligence DABUS is analyzed and the results of its consideration in the European Patent Organization, the United Kingdom and the United States are summarized. In particular, it has been established that artificial intelligence technologies are currently not considered as inventors in either the Romano-Germanic or Anglo-Saxon legal systems.",2021,Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Compulsory Licenses of Patented Inventions in Iranian Law,Compulsory Licenses; Patent Rights; Public interests; Balance of Interests; Iranian Law; ,"Compulsory licenses of patented inventions are recognized in Iranian law. The issuance of such licenses is subject to the occurrence of exceptional cases of preserving national security, public health or development of other vital-economic sectors of the country. Additionally, they are a remedy for anticompetitive practices and where the exploitation of an invention depends on another prior invention, a compulsory license may be issued in favor of the second inventor. An examination of the conditions of granting compulsory licenses indicates the Iranian legislator's attempt to deal with extraordinary circumstances at the national level while respecting the innovators' rights and that such licenses are a means to make a balance between the society's right to be safe, stable and secure and the patent holders' rights to exploit their inventions. The results of this descriptive-analytical study show that, as far as compulsory licenses of inventions are concerned, the Iranian law is in accordance with the provisions of the Paris Convention and the TRIPS Agreement.",2023,Government & Law,1
Inventive Indians: Technological Imaginaries and Patenting Activity in Late Colonial India (1911-48),Colonialism; India; innovation; patent; science; technology; LAW; COPYRIGHT; MEDICINE; DESIGNS,"The Patent Act extended to colonial India in 1859 introduced to Indians the right to file a patent for an invention. The article locates India as a site for invention and innovation, not by looking at the legal evolution of the law or the inventions themselves, but at the Indian patentees' engagement with the law. The consistent but small number of Indian patentees is suggestive of patent-filing being a form of sustained engagement with technological modernity. The establishment of a Patent Office completed the bureaucratic structure and was an intrinsic part of the development of India as a technocratic and scientific state. Examining the nature of this colonial institution, the paper examines a parallel process which shaped patenting: Indianisation. The colonial policy of Indianisation shaped Indians' access to employment and research in technical institutes. This had two visible but discrete consequences: in the number of Indian employees whose patents were acquired by the government, and the creation of a notable 'patent culture' with the Patent Office in Calcutta as a site and headed by an Indian. The paper uses the patent law as an axis to illuminate conversations around inventive activity in colonial India.",2024,Area Studies; History; Asian Studies,1
"Minerva Surgical, Inc. v. Hologic, Inc. Supreme Court of the United States, 2021 141 S.Ct. 2298",; ,"The question presented in this case is whether the judge-made doctrine of assignor estoppel,which limits an inventor's ability to assign a patent to another for value and later contend in litigation that the patent is invalid, is still good law. A five-Justice majority held that the doctrine is still good law, but went on to clarify that it reaches only so far as the equitable principle long understood to lie at its core.The Court clarified that the doctrine only applies when the assignor's claim of invalidity contradicts explicit or implicit representations he made in assigning the patent. The Court provides the following examples of when the doctrine does not apply: (1) when the assignment occurs before an inventor can possibly make a warranty of validity as to specific patent claims, e.g., an employee assigns to his employer patent rights in any future inventions he develops during his employment, and the employer then decides which, if any, of those inventions to patent; (2) when a later legal development renders irrelevant the warranty given at the time of assignment, e.g., the governing law changes in a manner that renders previously valid patent claims invalid; and (3) when an inventor assigns a patent application, rather than an issued patent, and the patent claim that ultimately issues is materially broader than the claims appearing in the originally assigned application. The case was remanded for the Federal Circuit to address whether the patent owner's new claim is materially broader than the ones the inventor assigned. Justice Alito filed a dissenting opinion arguing that the writ should have been dismissed as improvidently granted. Justice Barrett (with whom Justices Thomas and Gorsuch joined) filed a dissenting opinion arguing that assignor estoppel was abrogated by the Patent Act of 1952. These Justices argue that that the Patent Act of 1952 does not incorporate the doctrine, and point out that the Court lacks authority to develop federal common law on the subject. This decision is the subject of a Holman Report in this edition of Biotechnology Law Report.",2021,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1
"Mexican Patent Litigation, International Intellectual Property Treaties and the Extension of Patent Term of Protection",Patent Litigation; PCT; National Treatment; Mexico; USMCA; NAFTA; ,"This article analyzes how the provisions on patent term adjustments contained in the new United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) will be problematic for Mexico. To illustrate this point, the article revisits a patent litigation in Mexico. The plaintiff was a Japanese company who was suing over the infringement of its rights by a Mexican Lab. In this case, Transitional Article Twelve of the Mexican Industrial Property Act was applied to recognize a priority filing date seven years later than its original filing in Japan. The litigation involved several issues such as the extension of the term of protection and the alleged infringement by the defendant after the authorities had extended the term of the patent. There are several principles and concerns discussed, including the principle of patent independence, national treatment, and minimum term of protection, all of which are contained in the Paris Convention, the TRIPS Agreement, and the Patent Cooperation Treaty.",2020,Government & Law,1
The Failure of a Pure Patent Market,patent; asset class; market intermediary; convention; regulation; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; TECHNOLOGY; TROLLS; BROKERS; FIRMS,"This paper presents an analysis of the movement to make patents a new asset class, and its relative failure. Our thesis is that this creation is largely dependent on the construction of a market devoted to transactions in patents, and not just in technology licenses, and on the emergence of new intellectual property intermediaries akin to finance, whose activity must nevertheless be regulated. Our analysis is based on the various patent valuation conventions that underpin its institutionalization and the variety of its uses.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Reconsidering Conflicts over Gene Patents in View of Taiwan Patent Law,gene patent; compulsory license; Myriad; research exemption; Taiwan Patent Act; patient access; patent eligibility; ,"This article discusses the legal and policy issues arising out of gene patents in light of the United States Supreme Court's Myriad decision. There are alternatives to an outright ban on all gene patents. This article proposes recommendations to accommodate the competing interests of patient access to beneficial technologies and gene patenting. In order to balance the competing interests of encouraging innovation while making gene-based medical treatment more accessible, a research exemption from patent infringement and compulsory licensing of a gene patent is suggested by referring to the Taiwan Patent Act. These solutions would ensure scientists and other groups the opportunity to use gene-related patents for the public interest or noncommercial purposes. The research exemption enables research on patented genes without the risk of being held liable for infringement, thereby promoting further advancement in the gene-related industry. The framework of a compulsory license ensures patient access to genetic treatment. These solutions, on the one hand, solve primary concerns surrounding gene patents, and on the other hand, maintain gene patent protection and the incentives needed to promote the progress of gene-related technologies.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1
"UNDERSTANDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: EXPRESSION, FUNCTION, AND INDIVIDUATION",; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; COMPUTER-PROGRAMS; FAIR-USE; ART; LAW,"Underlying the fundamental structure of intellectual property law specifically, the division between copyright and patent law - are at least two substantive philosophical assumptions. The first is that artistic works and inventions are importantly different, such that they warrant different legal systems: copyright law on the one hand, and patent law on the other. And the second is that particular artistic works and inventions can be determinately individuated from each other, and can thereby be the subjects of distinct and delineated legal rights. But neither the law nor existing scholarship provides a comprehensive analysis of these categories, what distinguishes them, or why their distinctions should matter to law. This Article seeks to substantiate and unify these assumptions, taking the most striking doctrinal difference between copyrights and patents as its theoretical starting point: namely, that copyright law has an independent creation defense while patent law does not. Endeavoring to vindicate this doctrinal distinction with a theory of what distinguishes the paradigmatic subject matters of copyrights and patents, this Article defends the view that artistic works are author-individuated, while inventions are structure-individuated. It draws on philosophical thinking, thought experiments, and existing practices surrounding expression and functionality to argue that, although two distinct inventive acts can result in the very same invention, two distinct acts of authorship - even ones resulting in works that are structurally identical - cannot result in the very same artistic work, because the identity of the author in part makes the work what it is. The Article explains how these individuation theses vindicate, not just copyright and patent law's differential treatment of independent creation, but other core features of intellectual property's defining bifurcation, and then goes on to analyze the theses' implications for different theories of what justifies intellectual property rights. Finally, the Article explores aspects of existing law that might be in tension with this conception of artistic works and inventions and thus ought to be revised to better reflect and incorporate it, if the individuation theses are indeed getting things right.",2023,Government & Law,1
THE BROKEN PROMISE DOCTRINE: ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC V APOTEX INC AND THE FUTURE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PATENTS,; ,"In AstraZeneca Canada Inc v Apotex Inc, the Supreme Court of Canada abolished the so-called promise doctrine in patent law. Large pharmaceutical companies that sought greater patent protections through litigation routinely mischaracterized the promise doctrine. To demonstrate that mischaracterization, this case comment begins by examining historical and international perspectives that informed the Supreme Court's decision. !is paper then turns to a critical yet subjective element of the decision: the analysis of the meaning and purpose of use and useful in the Patent Act. The reasons for the decision are then considered against the advantages that more stringent utility requirements oer to both patent law and the pharmaceutical industry. This paper concludes with the recent legacy of the decision and recommendations for why and how the courts might seek a middle ground for utility promises in patents.",2022,Government & Law,1
PATENTABILITY OF BIOTECHNOLOGY INVENTIONS: Indian Ethical Guidelines,Biotechnology Inventions; Patents; Ethics; Morality; ICMR; Bioethics Principle; Patent Protection; Public Order; ,"Advances in technology have made patenting of biotechnology inventions mandatory. The patent law system contains general clauses prohibiting the patenting of inventions contrary to public order or morality. Recent years have brought numerous debates on limiting the possibility of patent protection for biotechnology inventions for ethical reasons. The existing literature examines bioethical justification in terms of the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice. The primary purpose of this study is to explore the uncertainty of ethics guidelines provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and section 3(b) of the Indian Patents Act 1970 and the applicability of the bioethics principles.",2023,Religion,1
Toward a Centralized Hatch-Waxman Venue,; ACT,Pharmaceutical litigation often begins when a generic drug company files an application to have its generic drug approved by the FDA. That application is re-ceived by the FDA in the District of Maryland. To submit  it is a statutory act of patent infringement under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Establishing venue in subse-quent Hatch-Waxman litigation can be complex because Hatch -Waxman litigation often involves simultaneous and independent lawsuits against many generic applicants. A Hatch-Waxman plaintiff might reasonably attempt to consolidate litigation in a single district court; Hatch-Waxman defendants might reasonably resist consolidation in the plaintiff's preferred venue. Recent Supreme Court and Federal Circuit case law has narrowed venue options for Hatch-Waxman plaintiffs. This Comment argues for an interpretation of Hatch-Waxman's statutory act of patent infringement and the patent venue rules that moves toward a central-ized venue for Hatch-Waxman litigation in the District of Maryland.,2022,Government & Law,1
FAIR USE IN ORACLE: PROXIMATE CAUSE AT THE COPYRIGHT/PATENT DIVIDE,; TORT LAW; PROPERTY,"In Oracle America, Inc. v. Google LLC, the Federal Circuit undermined copyright law's deference to patent law and, in doing so, delivered a blow to both regimes. Copyright's deference to patent law-including a historic refusal to enforce rights that might undermine the public's liberty to copy unpatented inventions-is a necessary part of preserving inventors' willingness to accept the short duration, mandatory disclosure, and other stringent bargains patent law demands. Deference to patent law is also integral to copyright law's interior architecture; copyright's refusal to monopolize functional applications of creative work lowers the social costs that would otherwise be imposed by copyright's ease of acquisition and long duration. If patent law refuses to protect a functional device or other innovation (perhaps because its patent has expired or because the innovation would be obvious to anyone skilled in the field), various copyright doctrines make it difficult for an eager claimant to use copyright law instead. These doctrines act like fences. For example, under 17 U.S.C. 102(b), copyright cannot extend to ideas or to any procedure, process, system, [or] method of operation. This prohibition applies regardless of the copyrighted form in which the idea, procedure, process, or method appears. Therefore, the public violates no copyright duties when it copies, say, ideas about how to improve the manufacture of steel from a copyrighted instruction manual or video. If the creator of the manufacturing idea wants protection for it, the inventor needs to look to patent law. Similarly, although copyright can subsist in drawings of a useful article, 17 U.S.C. 113(b) and the case law disable those copyrights from giving any rights to keep others from making or selling the article. Say the inventors of an automobile engine with improved fuel efficiency want to restrain others from building and selling copycat engines. To restrain such functional copying, the inventors get no mileage out of the copyrights that subsist in their blueprints. Rather, to stop competitors from building and selling the new engine, the inventors must seek the protection of patent law. Under yet another statutory rule, 17 U.S.C. 101, sculptured shapes that have an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information are not copyrightable unless their aesthetic and functional components are separable. The instant Article discusses these and other limits on copyright law. Their overall impact is to emphasize the importance Congress and the courts give to preventing copyright law from directly or indirectly competing with patent law, or undermining the choices Congress embedded in the patent statute. Computer-program copyrights were intended to protect a programmer's expression, not their engineering ingenuity. As technology poses new challenges, separate intellectual property laws need to keep congruent with the separate purposes each serves. The Supreme Court has granted certiorari in Oracle, allowing the Court to evaluate a judicial opinion that this Article argues ignored these first principles. A need for congruence (or fit) is recognized in most areas of civil liability. For example, in enforcing the Clayton Act, the Supreme Court honored the need for congruence by creating a doctrine it called antitrust injury to limit liability. The common law of torts generally employs the doctrine called proximate cause to similarly assure fit between the facts of a given case and the law's purposes. In copyright law, the courts and Congress entrust this familiar but crucial task to fair use. The instant Article employs analogies from antitrust and the common law of torts to reinforce the appropriateness of using the fair use doctrine to keep copyright law in its own yard.",2020,Government & Law,1
Global flows of knowledge: expectations toward transnational regulatory aspects of intellectual property rights in the 20th century chemical industry,Patents; Paris convention; E. Merck; regulation; ,"Legal and global historical research, especially about the German Empire, has identified an increasing tendency to internationalize the rule making of economic and technical contexts. Also the international protection of intellectual property rights made progress, so it seemed. The Paris Convention of 1883 did not harmonize the different national patent regimes, but intended to facilitate the transnational flow of inventions by a coordinated system of application and novelty. The aim of our paper is to show this limited approach of the Paris convention during the decades to come from two angles: The discussion and growing pressure from the part of the German Industry toward joining the convention, and - after 1903 - the concrete dealing with the convention's regulation, highlighted with a case study of the 1930s. It shows in detail the dealings between E. Merck, Darmstadt, and its US counterparts, when it came to secure priority rights in several European countries. The case studies show that an efficient transnational use of inventions could not really be achieved by the Paris convention, but rather by a self-regulative contract and patent management of the actors.",2020,History; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,1
COLLUDING AGAINST A PATENT,; ANTITRUST; LAW; RULE; HOLDUP; REASON; FRAND; GOALS,"The patent system fosters innovation by granting the right to exclude. Since a rightsholder can legally suppress competition and charge monopoly prices, a patent provides a type of antitrust immunity. Even when firms allegedly abuse their exclusive rights through the creation of patent thickets, meritless infringement litigation, or breaching one's FRAND commitment, courts and federal agencies have concluded that antitrust is ill-equipped to discipline patent practices. Without antitrust remedies, firms have banded together against rightsholders to negotiate for better terms. Their strategies have included boycotting abusive patentees, as well as collectively negotiating against them. By using self-help remedies, they seek to pay fair rates for only the patents needed for their technology. This type of cooperation may ideally foster competition and innovation where patent abuses undermine both goals. The problem is, ironically, that combining against a monopolist is likely anticompetitive. Antitrust condemns collusion to manipulate prices-here, licensing rates-even when done against a monopolist. This renders a troubling outcome where Big Pharma, Big Tech, and others can insulate their monopoly power using the very laws meant to condemn monopolies. While debate has emerged about patent abuses, an equally salient issue involves whether antitrust should condemn firms who collude against patent holders and monopolists. Using economic and historical evidence, this Article argues that antitrust law should allow firms to defend an antitrust claim by citing their rival's market power. Our models show that powerful rightsholders do, in fact, harm competition and innovation in ways not meant to protect original technology. We then find that the benefits of collusion among smaller firms were advanced by the Sherman Act's drafters, whose comments are critical to shaping and understanding modern antitrust. Support even comes from the labor arena: Congress excluded workers from antitrust law-as labor unions were once considered a form of collusion-so that workers could counterbalance their employers' dominance with their own market power. As such, given the practical and theoretical difficulties of remedying anticompetitive abuses of patent rights under the antitrust laws, we assert that taking antitrust out of patent law would allow competition to flourish in dynamic markets while enhancing the patent system's incentives to innovate.",2021,Government & Law,1
UNCREATIVE DESIGNS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COPYRIGHT; CREATIVITY; LAW; HISTORY; FEIST,"It is often said that the standards for patent protection are higher than the standards for copyright protection. Specifically, commentators assert that the copyright requirement of originality is easier to satisfy than the patent requirements of novelty and nonobviousness. And yet, the USPTO regularly grants patents for designs that fall below the low standard of copyright originality set by the Supreme Court in Feist v. Rural. Some may suggest that the existence of these sub-Feist design patents is a result of the USPTO abandoning its duty to scrutinize design patent applications. Or they may suggest that it is a result of the Federal Circuit making it more difficult to invalidate designs as anticipated or obvious. This Article argues that sub-Feist designs exist because the standard for originality (at least, in the sense of minimal creativity) is not really lower than novelty or nonobviousness-it's just different. This has implications for how we think about the law and theory of copyright and patents as well as specific implications for design patent law and practice. Importantly, this suggests that we should take the word original-which is also an explicit statutory requirement for design patents-seriously. We should not assume that a design that qualifies, under the Patent Act, as novel and nonobvious is also original under the Feist standard. And if, as the Supreme Court has held, the Feist originality standard is a requirement of the Progress Clause, we should not let applicants use design patents to evade that requirement",2024,Government & Law,1
The Constitutionality of Medicare Drug-Price Negotiation under the Takings Clause,Inflation Reduction Act; Medicare; Patents; Price Negotiation; Takings Clause; ,"In recent months, pharmaceutical manufacturers have brought legal challenges to a provision of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) empowering the federal government to negotiate the prices Medicare pays for certain prescription medications. One key argument made in these filings is that price negotiation is a taking of property and violates the Takings Clause of the US Constitution. Through original case law and health policy analysis, we show that government price negotiation and even price regulation of goods and services, including patented goods, are constitutional under the Takings Clause. Finding that the IRA violates the Takings Clause would radically upend settled constitutional law and jeopardize the US's most important state and federal health care programs.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,1
At the Crossroads? Assessing SEP Injunctive Relief under Patent Law and Competition Law in China,; ,"A patent may be essential to implementing a standard, namely the standard essential patent (SEP). The injunctive relief initiated by the SEP holder may raise anti-competitive concerns. From a comparative legal perspective, both patent law and competition law may play an important role in dealing with SEP injunction issues. The common law frequently uses patent law, while civil law jurisdictions favour competition law. In practice, China handles SEP cases by applying both patent law and anti-monopoly law, without distinguishing between the conditions under which each law should be applied. By learning from comparative experience, China needs to further clarify the functions of patent law and competition law approaches in regulating SEP injunctions. China needs to reshape its patent rules based on interest balance. China also needs to improve anti-monopoly rules in order to focus on antitrust harm.",2023,Government & Law,1
The dilemma and improvement of anti-suit injunctions in standard-essential patent litigation in China,Anti-suit injunctions; Standard essential patents; Litigation; China; Act preservation; International norms; ,"Allocating jurisdiction and harmonizing anti-suit injunctions (ASIs) in concurrent litigation is a challenging task due to the complex and transnational nature of standard essential patent (SEP) licensing concerns. Notably, in the case of Huawei v. Conversant, the supreme people's court (SPC) of China demonstrated ingenuity by applying the act preservation system to issue the country's first ASI. This was done using a five-factor framework that considered the fairness and necessity of preservation measures, the parties' interests, the public interest, and international comity. Chinese courts have subsequently utilized this framework in several cases to issue ASIs with more extensive and varied scopes. This shift indicates China's transition from a passive recipient to an active participant in ASI matters. Nevertheless, it is important to note that China lacks a legal foundation that explicitly permits the use of ASIs, necessitating further clarification regarding their circumstances of application. This article argues that directly applying the act preservation system to the ASI system lacks sufficient justification or may be constrained by the law, thereby granting judges greater discretion. By comparing Chinese ASI with traditional Western ASI, it becomes apparent that the impact of act preservation does not extend to international litigation and is more akin to an injunction, restricting the parties' tort. Consequently, China should adopt a construction model of the act preservation system, incorporating the guiding principles of the ASI system, as well as the supporting appeal and retrial system, into its Civil Procedure Law. Additionally, providing judicial interpretation to elucidate the specific conditions for ASI application would be beneficial. These efforts have the potential to foster the development of a more predictable and stable international patent system. This, in turn, would benefit both patent owners and implementers, promote innovation, and facilitate global economic development.",2024,Government & Law,1
Generic Drugs and the Struggle to Compete: The Role of Skinny Labels,Drugs; Patent protection; Generics; Drug labels; ,"Purpose: The generic drug industry currently faces multiple, serious issues that threaten the US drug supply. So-called skinny labels  are one of the few tools authorized by Congress to expedite entry into the market by generic competitors when the first patent for a brand's drug compound (only) expires. This article reviews the law on this expedited marketing pathway for generic competitors, as well as limitations on its use. Methods: We examined the literature on patent protection of brand drugs, including the timelines for production of generic competitors. We also examined the law concerning skinny labels, including a recent decision of the US Federal Circuit Court that clearly articulates the guidelines concerning entry into the generic market, including labeling, marketing, and promotion. Findings: Skinny labels that follow the regulations set forth in the Hatch -Waxman Act, including the necessary carve -out procedure for methods of use  still protected by 1 or more active patents, do not infringe a brand drug's label. Furthermore, the skinny label does not induce or contribute to infringement merely because its label contains US Food and Drug Administration-required safety profile data -even when the data cross-reference superiority studies on still -patent protected methods of use elsewhere in the label. Implications: Generic drugs have become essential to the broad, general availability of clinical therapeutic agents. The Hatch -Waxman Act was intended to facilitate entry of generic competitors into the marketplace, and the skinny label is an important tool to accomplish that end. As long as the generic manufacturer follows the essential skinny -label rules, specifically including marketing the compound without promoting or advertising those methods of use still protected by ongoing patents, the law will not find induced or contributory infringement.",2024,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

FEDERAL JUDGE SEEKS PATENT CASES,; LAW; CIRCUIT; CHOICE; COMPETITION; SELECTION,"That probably seems like a bizarre Craigslist ad. It's not real-we mocked it up for this article. Still, and startlingly, it accurately portrays what's happening in the Waco Division of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. One judge, appointed to the Western District only three years ago, has been advertising his courtroom through presentations to patent lawyers, comments to the media, procedural practices, and decisions in patent cases as the place to file a patent infringement lawsuit. That advertising has succeeded. In 2016 and 2017, the Waco Division received a total of five patent cases. In 2020, nearly eight hundred patent cases-more than 20 percent of all patent cases nationwide-were filed there. The centralization of patent cases before a single judge, acting entirely on his own to seek out patent litigation, is facilitated by the Western District's case filing system, which allows plaintiffs to choose the specific judge who will hear their case. These dynamics- a judge advertising for patent cases and plaintiffs shopping for that judge- undermine public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary, make the court an uneven playing field for litigants, and facilitate the nuisance suits patent trolls favor. Two common-sense reforms would reduce the harms of judge shopping: (1) district judges should, by law, be randomly assigned to cases, and (2) venue in patent cases should be tied to divisions within a judicial district, not just the district as a whole.",2021,Government & Law,1
Artificial intelligence as object of intellectual property in Indonesian law,AI; copyright; IoT; patent; ,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has an important role in digital transformation worldwide, including in Indonesia. AI itself is a simulation of human intelligence that is modeled in machines and programmed to think like humans. At the time AI and the Internet of Things are connected, it can, in principle, act on data without the need for human intervention. AI was originally created by humans as a consequence of the massive digital revolution. Recently, AI has also developed rapidly to perform functions like humans and even produce works of intellectual property like humans, such as creating songs, making new inventions, making industrial designs, and so on. Thus, it is a question whether AI can be qualified as a legal subject of creator, inventor or designer and then register as intellectual property. This research answers this question from the perspective of Indonesian law based on Copyright Law, Patent Law, Industrial Design Law, as well as Trademark Law, and Geographical Indications as the existing Indonesian laws.",2023,Government & Law,1

Genome Editing in Human Gametes and Embryos: The Legal Dimension in Europe,genome editing; genetic interventions; Oviedo Convention; human gametes; human embryos; research; reproductive applications; precautionary principle; safety; morality clauses; CRISPR; BIOTECHNOLOGY,"To date, the legal aspects of the ongoing debate on the application of genome editing in human gametes and early embryos have attracted little attention. In Europe, this seems to have changed with a recent official position that clarifies the meaning of the relevant provision of the common legal instrument on Human Rights and Biomedicine (Oviedo Convention). This provision explicitly prohibits modifications to the genome of future persons and adoptes a precautionary stance with regard to genetic interventions in the human reproductive material. In this article, we examine relevant interpretative options, following the new official clarifications, focusing on the research/clinical application distinctions that characterize their approach. From this viewpoint, we propose an approach that favors basic research activities involving genome editing, even for exploring potential clinical applications under conditions of safety, which may justify a future legislative amendment. Furthermore, we explore the patenting issue, based on the current approach of European case law, and give reasons that may justify patent rights in this ethically sensitive area.",2022,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1
Divisional patents: a system prone to abuse,EU; Competition law; Antitrust; Patents; Divisional patents; Pharmaceuticals; Monopoly; Judicial review; EU COMPETITION LAW,"Divisional patents are derivatives to an already active patent or pending application used to separate part of the parent-patent's subject-matter and create a new autonomous patent. They are extensively used in the pharmaceuticals sector to protect blockbuster medicines with multiple overarching patent rights, thus creating complex patent portfolios. These strategies have attracted the attention of competition enforcers and judicial bodies as potential abuses of dominant position because they aim to prevent and delay generic market entry for the patent holder to maintain their monopolistic prices. However, scrutinizing these strategies has proven challenging because the current rules are prone to exploitation, there is no unified approach to evaluating them, and the core of the issue is the much-debated interplay between IP and competition law. It will be shown that European case law varies across jurisdictions, with none of the current solutions fully addressing the issues. In the search for a functional, effective system, it is essential to understand the rationale behind patent rights, the unique features of the pharmaceuticals sector, and the arguments for and against the use of competition law to scrutinize patent strategies. On this basis, the article proposes a system which combines competition law enforcement with patent law amendments.",2024,Government & Law,1
Do discretion criteria for patent administrative law enforcement encourage innovation among firms?,Discretion criteria; Administrative enforcement; Innovation; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; REFORM,"The management by administrative authorities of law violations represents one of the instruments for enforcing laws in China, the other way is lawsuit. The law allows administrative discretion to achieve efficiency but may lead to unfair law enforcement. Governments' establishing patent administrative discretion criteria can deter unfair law enforcement by guiding administrators to determine administrative penalties. As such, a quasi-experimental approach testing the discretion criteria established by provincial patent administrative authorities was used in the current study to evaluate the impact of discretion criteria on law enforcement and innovation among firms. The empirical evidence shows that patent administrative discretion criteria increase the number of patent administrative law enforcement cases and encourage firms to apply for more patents, and this impact is larger for firms in industries where the new product market is broader, patent license fees are higher, patent rights easier to be infringed upon, and R&D duration is lengthier.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Trading in Information: On the Unlikely Correspondence Between Patents and Blackmail Law,Adverse selection; Appropriability problem; Blackmail; Patents; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; PROPERTY-RIGHTS,"This paper studies the problem of trading in information in two seemingly unrelated settings: inventive activity; and blackmail. In the former, a discoverer of some new information wishes to profit from it but may be deterred because the act of disclosure effectively makes the information public. Thus, legal protection of the information in the form of a patent is usually needed to allow the inventive process to proceed. Blackmail also involves trading in information; but because the transaction is between two parties who already know its content-the discoverer, and someone who wishes to keep it hidden-the appropriability problem is absent. The paradox of blackmail is why the blackmailer prefers to sell the information to the informed party rather than to the uninformed party (who actually values it more); this latter transaction would be legal. The resolution of the paradox provides the link to patent law, because the latter transaction does involve the appropriability problem.",2020,Business & Economics,1

SCALPELS OVER SLEDGEHAMMERS: SAVING DIAGNOSTIC PATENTS THROUGH JUDICIAL INTERVENTION RATHER THAN LEGISLATIVE OVERRIDE,; ,"Diagnostic tests have become indispensable in the rapidly growing field known as precision medicine. Precision medicine tailors treatments to individual patients by using these diagnostic tests to identify how a patient may respond to different therapies. Diagnostics are expensive to develop but show promise in optimizing patient treatment and creating healthcare savings. Even as the medical community has heralded precision medicine as the way of the future, the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit have handed down a dizzying array of decisions regarding attempts to patent diagnostics and precision medicine techniques. Subsequently, courts have struggled to apply the test for patent eligibility, leaving the interpretation of patentable subject matter under 101 of the Patent Act in a state of chaos. This chaos has created concerns that diagnostics may be unpatentable, providing minimal protection or incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in their development. To rectify this confusion, legislators have proposed overhauling the longstanding Patent Act and rewriting the patent-eligibility statute altogether. This Note argues that these legislative attempts are misguided. Though some remedy for the current patent-eligibility test is required, that solution should come from the courts, not the legislature. Courts can use a dynamic and nuanced common law approach to create a standard that can adapt to the continuously evolving technologies and scientific advancements that seek patent protection. A legislative override, on the other hand, could leave the patent statute in as much chaos as before. A judicial refinement of the patent-eligibility test would allow for the patenting of meritorious diagnostics, providing the necessary innovation incentives for their continued development.",2021,Government & Law,1
"Law, Fact, and Patent Validity",; MIXED QUESTIONS,"Judges, not juries, typically decide questions of law. Likewise, it is judges who usually review the legality of actions taken by government agencies. And when judges orjuries decidefact-laden issues in civil litigation, those decisions commonly receive deference on appeal. Patent law, however, does all of this precisely backwards. In patent infringement cases, juries often decide the legal question of patent validity. When a jury rules on a patent's validity, it is reviewing the work of an administrative agency, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. And decisions on the case-specific, fact-specific issue of patent validity are reviewed de novo by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction over patent cases. These unusual features of patent litigation create significant inefficiencies: patent jury trials are expensive and jury decisions on technologically complex questions of patentability can be unpredictable; stringent standards of appellate review encourage prolonged litigation and result in costly postappeal do-overs. All of this occurs because the Federal Circuit has drawn a strict, bright line between questions of law and questions offact, leaving little room for a middle category of questions that require applying the law to the facts of a particular case. In most areas of law but not often in patent law those questions are called mixed questions of law and fact. This Article advances a simple thesis: that all questions ofpatent validity are, ultimately, mixed questions of law and fact. This approach would greatly simplify Federal Circuit doctrine, which currently treats some validity issues as questions of law, others as questions offact, and still others as questions of law based on underlyingfacts. It would also clarify ambiguities in Supreme Court precedent on the law-fact distinction in patent litigation, which similarly resists using the phrase mixed question. In addition, treating patent validity as a mixed question would improve the procedure of patent litigation in numerous ways: patent validity would be resolved in reasoned opinions by a judge rather than in the black box of a general jury verdict, those on-the-record judicial decisions would receive appropriate deference on appeal, and judicial review of Patent Office actions would be brought further into the mainstream of administrative law.",2021,Government & Law,1

We illustrate that due to weak protection of intellectual property rights in China, firms rely on external legal resources, which are found to be positively related to patenting performance in terms of the capability of external patent law expertise, but negatively related in terms of knowledge diversity. The marginal effect of the level of external patent law expertise on patenting performance is positive when research and development (R&D) invest-ment is low and negative when it is high, illustrating the negative interaction between R&D investment and the level of external patent law expertise. Furthermore, institutional pressure and support moderate the effect of the level of external patent law expertise on patenting performance. This study advances the under-standing of the impact of patent institutions on patent strategies in transition economies and provides novel implications for policy and patent management.

Several European countries maintained the so-called professor's privilege, an exception to employment law whereby university researchers were allowed to retain the ownership of academic inventions. The 2000s were characterised by convergence towards a more homogeneous system, in which university administrations took control of IP management. We investigate the impact of the reform and we observe a decline in the technological importance and the value of the patents owned and managed by universities in the countries abolishing the professor's privilege. On the contrary, by differentiating the academic patents by type of ownership, we find that the technological importance of academic patents owned by companies has instead increased. Our study produces some new results that may alert policymakers to the possible unintended consequences of the university ownership model.",2021,Business & Economics,1
The Fourth Amendment of Chinese Patent Law and Discussion on its Practical Effects,; ,"Through comparative study, case and data analysis, this article summarizes the key points of the fourth amendment of Chinese Patent Law, and analyses the expected practical significance. Meanwhile, this article also discusses the shortcomings of the new patent law after the fourth amendment, and puts forward some suggestions for further improvement and refinement. The purpose of the fourth amendment of Chinese Patent Law is mainly to make the Chinese patent system more in line with the current technological and economic development in China as well as international cooperative innovation. The core points of the fourth amendment include: (1) strengthening patent enforcement by adopting punitive damages to intentional patent infringement, and increasing the patent protection duration extension for new pharmaceuticals, etc. (2) Promoting patent implementation by adding 'Open Licence' rules and improving employees' invention regulations; (3) Improving design patent protection by expending protection duration and adopting protection for partial designs. (4) Increasing the provisions about the grace period for patent filings of inventions related to public interests. The new Patent Law 2020 will gradually show its significant practical effects. At the same time, however, there are still some regulations that need to be further clarified and refined for ensuring better implementation of the new law.",2023,Area Studies,1
INTERNATIONAL PATENT LAW AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN INDONESIA: CAN IT FACILITATE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER?,Indonesian Patent Law; innovation; International Patent Law; technology transfer; TRIPs Agreement; ,"Background and Purpose: Indonesia has patent law for more than three decades and has made adjustments with the Trade related of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement by revising such patent law several times with the aim of encouraging innovation and technology transfer as promised by the Agreement, but technological capacity and technology transfer are still low. The purpose of this study is to analyse whether the implementation of international patent law in Indonesia facilitates innovation and technology transfer to increase technological capacity. Methodology: This study used a normative legal research methodology. It used statutory and conceptual approaches. Both approaches were needed to analyse conceptual and theoretical works related to this topic and to examine consistency of applicable laws and policy. Legal resources and legal documents were analysed using descriptive qualitative analysis. Findings: This study found that the implementation of international patent law to promote innovation and technology transfer in Indonesia was still not easy to be seen because the Indonesian Patent Law was not designed comprehensively to promote innovation and technology transfer and lack of consistency of regulations and policies on technology transfer. It also paid less attention to facilitate international technology transfer. Contributions: This study suggests that Indonesia needs comprehensiveness and consistency of all prevailing laws and regulation related to technology transfer, research and development, particularly patent law, to fully use flexibility provided by the TRIPs Agreement to enhance national technological capacity and innovation.",2021,Area Studies,1

Our study is articulated in two parts. First, we show that, although it is still a quite rare phenomenon, patent litigation involving universities has been significantly growing in the last 2 decades. Second, we study the characteristics of university patents that have been litigated vis-a-vis non-litigated university patents. In this respect, we find that public universities and non-US universities are less inclined to litigate their patents compared to private and US universities. In addition, we also find that patent quality is an important determinant in the decision of university litigation. This result holds for patents in the Electrical Engineering sector, which is traditionally prone to opportunistic litigation, and no matter what type of university involved (public vs private, or US vs non-US).",2022,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,1

Gendered 'Objective' Patent Law: Of Binaries and a Singularity,; SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; COMPUTER-SCIENCE; WOMEN INVENTORS; PROPERTY; BIOPIRACY; MOTHERS; WORK; GAP,"Patent law protects the technical. It is seemingly objective in terminology and application. Yet studies show that males are significantly more likely than females to be the inventors of patented inventions. Patenting is not objective, it is gendered. The reasons for this are multiple and include the fact that patent law itself, including its presumptions and interpretation, is gendered. This article examines how patent law reflects multiple gendered binaries, despite being drafted in ostensibly neutral terms. These serve to favour masculine modes and fields of creation, while ignoring and devaluing feminine knowledge and ways of knowing. We should be concerned that patent law is gendered because patents affect wealth distribution, what is invented and commercialized, and what information and knowledge is disseminated, built upon, and viewed as valuable. Thus, instead of embodying gendered binaries, the law should reflect a singularity - a unique point, where the system degenerates or diverges to recognize and encourage the multiplicity of ways in which invention and innovation can and do occur, beyond socially constructed binaries.",2020,Government & Law; Sociology,1
When stronger patent law reduces patenting: Empirical evidence,CAFC; entry; patent law; patent strategy; strategic patents; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INNOVATION; IMPACT; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIES; THICKETS; COURTS; ENTRY; FIRMS,"Research Summary Theoretically, stronger legal protection affects strategic portfolios in two ways. As each patent becomes more effective, the gain from multiple patents would be less, reducing the demand for patents (negative inframarginal effect). With the effective price of patent protection being lower, the demand for protection and patents would increase (positive marginal effect). The net effect is more likely to be negative in complex technology industries, and magnified by patent ownership fragmentation, manufacturing assets, technological competition, and size. Exploiting variation in the shift in patent law due to the Federal Circuit Appeals Court (CAFC), we find that the average increase in patent protection due to the CAFC led businesses to reduce strategic patenting by 23.3%, and the contingent effects accorded with the hypotheses. Managerial Summary How should businesses adjust patent portfolios to changes in the legal protection of patents? As each patent becomes more effective, the gain from multiple patents would be less, reducing the demand for patents. With the effective price of patent protection being lower, the demand for protection and patents would increase. The net effect is more likely to be negative where the stakes (costs of holdup or gain from exclusivity) are larger. Empirical evidence from strategic patenting by U.S. manufacturing businesses between 1986 and 1992 before and after changes in patent law due to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit supports our propositions.",2023,Business & Economics,1
"'AI is not an Inventor': Thaler v Comptroller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks and the Patentability of AI Inventions",; ,"The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in inventive processes raises numerous patent law issues, including whether AI can be an inventor under law and who owns the AI-generated inventions. The UK Supreme Court decision in Thaler v Comptroller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks has provided an ultimate answer to this question: AI cannot be an inventor for the purposes of patent law. This note argues, first, that while such a human-centric approach to inventorship might discourage the use and development of AI technologies with autonomous invention capabilities, it will help retain an active human involvement in technologically supported inventive processes and continuously foster human ingenuity. Second, despite the Court focusing on what patent law is and not on what the law should be, the decision will be influential in the ongoing discussions on the future of patent law and will make it more difficult to expand patent law to incorporate non-human inventors. Third, the decision has opened, or revealed, the gaps in patent law that the emergence of AI technologies have created and for which new legal solutions will be needed, especially with relation to the ownership of AI-assisted inventions and the validation of inventorship claims.",2024,Government & Law,1

Patent Trolls and the Market for Acquisitions,; MERGERS; FIRMS; TAKEOVER; RETURNS,"I study the effect of patent-infringement claims by patent trolls on acquisitions of small firms. Exploiting staggered adoption of state anti-patent troll laws, I find that the laws have two effects. First, the number of acquisitions of small firms declines after these laws are adopted. Second, the anti-troll laws increase the acquisition price for acquirers. The market reflects the increased cost of acquisition as measured by lower acquisition announcement returns. Large firms increase R&D after the adoption of state laws, replacing external innovation. Using a sample of acquisitions that are plausibly unaffected by the laws, I disentangle alternative explanations.",2023,Business & Economics,1

Section 1498(A) is Not a Rx to Reduce Drug Prices,; ,"On June 20, 2018, The New York Times published an editorial captioned How the Government Can Lower Drug Prices, announcing that a possible solution involves an obscure part of federal law known as Section 1498. The provision acts as a sort of eminent domain for patented inventions allowing the government to circumvent patent protections if the patent holder is compensated. In the case of a pharmaceutical, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can authorize a drug maker to produce a low-cost generic version, which it would then buy in bulk.1 The authority cited by The New York Times for this proposition was a 2016 law review article published in the Yale Journal of Law & Technology (Yale Article).2 Fast forward to March 23, 2021. Within weeks of President Biden's inauguration, Senator Bernie Sanders delivered the Opening Statement at a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee hearing citing The New York Times editorial as support for the introduction of S. 909, the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2021, proposed legislation that would authorize the HHS Secretary to infringe on pharmaceutical patents or require pharmaceutical patent owners to enter compulsory licenses at royalty rates established by HHS should those patent owners be found to have charged excessive rates for the drug in question.3 On February 17, 2022, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus S. King, Jr., with Congressman Lloyd Doggett, wrote a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra urging him to use  existing executive authority to lower drug prices.4 On March 24, 2022, eight public interest groups forwarded the HHS Secretary a Petition To Make Drugs More Affordable, citing the Yale Article.5 On April 22, 2022, Senator Warren again wrote to the HHS Secretary attaching an April 22, 2022 letter from over 25 legal and public health experts describing 28 U.S.C. 1498 as the government patent use power, i.e., a tool that can be used to intervene when patients and public health are harmed by excessive drug prices.6 The chief author of this letter is none other than one of the authors who penned the 2016 Yale Article. And, on June 23, 2022, eight Senators and 103 members of Congress sent a letter to the HHS Secretary to utilize... government use compulsory licensing under 28 U.S.C. 1498... to lower prescription drug prices.7 In light of the close margins in the 118th Congress, continued pressure on the executive branch to exert 28 U.S.C. 1498 (a) should be expected. In Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States, 275 U.S. 331, 345 (1928), however, the United States Supreme Court held that the intention and purpose of Congress in the act of 1918 [(the predecessor to Section 1498)] was to stimulate contractors to furnish what was needed for [World War I], without fear of becoming liable themselves for infringements to inventors or the owners or assignees of patents. In 1949, Congress amended the Act of 1918 to precisely limit Section 1498(a) solely as a waiver of sovereign immunity to provide a private party with standing and a judicial forum in which to sue the government for patent infringement.8 No federal court, however, has held that the government has an absolute right to infringe privately held patent rights and therefore, historically, they have narrowly and strictly construed Section 1498(a), as we discuss below.",2022,Food Science & Technology; Government & Law; Nutrition & Dietetics; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
The Australian Best Method Doctrine: UK Roots and Lessons from US Law,; HISTORY; PATENTS,"Best method disclosure in a patent specification is a statutory requirement in Australia. The requirement was interpreted narrowly until 2016 when Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Pty Ltd was decided. A deep dive into the doctrinal development in the United Kingdom before 1977 and in the United States (US) before 2012 revealed that while the principles of quid pro quo social contract and public uberrima fide duty developed in the United Kingdom formed the common foundation for the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia, the best method doctrine developed under the 1949 British Act deviated from its original path and became unsuitable for Australia. In contrast, the US best mode doctrine and the current Australian best method doctrine are fundamentally similar. The US doctrine also offers a well -structured testing regime for assessing disclosure compliance. It is recommended that Australia adopts the US testing regime and amends s 40(2)(aa) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) to reflect the adoption.",2024,Government & Law,1

Infrostructure(s): Administering Information,; LAW; CENSUS; RACE; FREEDOM; PATENTS; ACCESS; SYSTEM; RIGHTS,"This Article, Infrostructure(s): Administering Information, considers how authoritative entities generate, manage, and produce informational structures, facilities, and architectures that support market creation and creative economy decision-making between private parties and entities. The term infrostructure, as opposed to other terms, such as infostructure and infosphere, suggests that infrostructures play vital roles in modern democratic life including producing new information resources, facilitating private transactions between private parties, and building the administrative state.This Article is divided into two parts. Part I discusses how information regulation is mediated through information forms and information systems with a focus on the materialities of information forms and systems. Part I then turns to how the infrostructure is built through three legal acts: specialIntscript the act of instantiation, in which law culls certain information from a broader universe of social information to produce authoritative information; specialIntscript the act of relation, in which law produces and reproduces social relations in information; and specialIntscript the act of meaning, in which law considers the legal effects of instantiation and representation.Part II will demonstrate how the project of infrostructure helps us to present a new story of administrative legitimation, by re-reading diverse areas including administrative law, intellectual property law and constitutional law. Specifically, Part II examines how infrostructure supports three different accounts of administrative legitimation: structural legitimation, expertise legitimation, and cultural legitimation.",2023,Government & Law,1
The innovation consequences of mandatory patent disclosures,Patent disclosure; Innovation; Spillovers; Proprietary costs; Corporate disclosure; PUBLICATION; PROPRIETARY; INFORMATION; DIFFUSION; ECONOMICS; SHOULDERS; GIANTS; MARKET,"We investigate the effect of patent disclosures on corporate innovation. Using the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA) as a shock that increased patent disclosures, we find an increase in innovation for firms whose rivals reveal more information after the AIPA and a decrease in innovation for firms whose own disclosures are divulged to competitors as a result of the law. These findings suggest patent disclosures generate both spillover benefits and proprietary costs. Our findings provide justification for patent disclosure requirements by demonstrating positive externalities: rivals' disclosures facilitate a firm's innovation. However, we also highlight that mandatory patent disclosures can impose proprietary costs on firms. These results broadly contribute to our understanding of the real effects of disclosure, such that forcing firms to share proprietary information can be privately costly but beneficial to other firms.& nbsp; (C)& nbsp;2020 The Authors.

MYTHS AND REALITY OF PATENT LAW AT THE SUPREME COURT,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PHOTOCOPIES; LITIGATION; CERTIORARI; SYSTEM; POLICY; RETURN; LIFE; BAR,"Over the past twenty years, patent cases have become a major component of the Supreme Court's shrinking docket. The Court's return to patent law after a long absence has inspired a rich literature theorizing about the Court's agenda and critiquing its decisions. Those analyses, though differing in their particulars, have given rise to numerous conventional wisdoms about the Supreme Court and patent law: that the Supreme Court distrusts the Federal Circuit (the specialized appellate court that has exclusive jurisdiction over patent cases), that the Court places far more trust in the Solicitor General (who represents the executive branch in Supreme Court litigation), and that, for better or worse, the Supreme Court is now a major institutional player in the patent system. But are those conventional wisdoms true? In this Article, we separate myth from reality by presenting a novel quantitative and qualitative study of all patent -related Supreme Court cases since 1982, the year the Federal Circuit began operating. Our study questions whether many of the patent cases decided by the Court have actually been important. Instead, we show that most of the Court's patent -related cases have involved issues far from the substantive core of patent law and are rarely cited by the Federal Circuit. Assessing the Court's impact on patent law, we argue, requires focusing on a small subset of decisions involving the core doctrines of patent validity and infringement. In those decisions, the Supreme Court has been surprisingly deferential to the Federal Circuit. The cases in which the Federal Circuit has performed poorly (at least in the eyes of the Supreme Court) cluster around issues of jurisdiction, procedure, and remedies. We also identify specific types of patent-related cases in which the Solicitor General wins far less frequently than usual. Testing other patent myths, we find support for the notions that the Supreme Court prefers malleable standards over bright -line rules and that the Supreme Court is less favorable for patent owners than the Federal Circuit. But we also find that Justice Breyer, often cited as the force behind the Court's growing patent docket, did not have an abnormally large influence over patent law. Similarly, specialist Supreme Court litigators, though increasingly involved in patent cases, don't seem to fare any better (or worse) than other lawyers in patent cases. In brief, our findings confirm some conventional wisdoms about the Supreme Court and patent law, disprove others, and offer a glimpse of patent law's future.",2024,Government & Law,1

Real-World Prior Art,; PATENTS; INNOVATION,"The most fundamental requirement of patent law is that a patented invention must be new. Given the longstanding, foundational nature of this novelty requirement, one might expect its contours to be well settled. Yet some of its most basic aspects remain unresolved. At the center of these unresolved issues lie what we term real-world prior art. In patent law, prior art is something that predates an invention and may render it not new. Real-world prior art activities involve using or selling embodiments of the invention. Consider a few examples. Suppose Aleida demonstrates her invention to members of the public but does not allow them to touch it. Has she put the invention into public use, thus preventing others from obtaining a patent? Suppose Aleida keeps her invention secret but uses it to provide a commercial service. Has she put the invention into public use or placed it on sale? Or suppose Aleida offers her invention for sale to Charlise, who declines to purchase it. It is black-letter patent law that after one year passes, Aleida cannot patent this invention. But imagine that Bruno independently develops the same invention. Can he obtain a patent? These questions are not outlandish law school hypotheticals-they are central issues surrounding whether an invention is or is not novel. Yet litigation over these issues has resulted in conflicting outcomes and contradictory explanations, leaving lower courts and the Patent Office to flounder. In this Article, we sort through this conceptual confusion and propose both doctrinal and institutional changes to elucidate this area of law. We argue that the value of resolving these questions runs much deeper than determining the answer to particular cases. The answers to these questions depend upon-and reveal-the conceptual superstructure of patent law. They implicate patent law's most central questions: What does it mean for an invention to be new and thus patentable? What policy interests does patent law attempt to achieve, and whose interests does it aim to protect? And what are the conditions under which a party has forfeited the opportunity to obtain a patent? By addressing these issues, we endeavor to place the entire jurisprudence of patent novelty on more solid footing.",2024,Government & Law,1
"Error Costs, Ratio Tests, and Patent Antitrust Law",Patent antitrust; Patent monopoly; False positives; False convictions; False negatives; False acquittals; Error costs; Ratio tests; ELASTICITY; DEMAND,"This paper examines the welfare tradeoff between patent and antitrust law. Since patent and antitrust law have contradictory goals, the question that naturally arises is how one should choose between the two in instances where there is a conflict. One sensible approach to choosing between two legal standards-or between proof standards with respect to evidence-is to consider the relative costs of errors. The approach in this paper is to consider the ratio of false positives to false negatives in patent antitrust. We find that the relevant error-cost ratio for patent antitrust is the proportion of the sum of the monopoly profit and the residual consumer surplus to the deadweight loss. This error-cost ratio-for a wide range of deterministic demand functions-ranges from infinity to a low of roughly three. This suggests that patent antitrust law should err on the side of protecting innovation incentives.",2020,Business & Economics,1

PABC: A Patent Application System Based on Blockchain,Patent; blockchain; smart contract; Hyperledger fabric; ,"Under the protection of the patent system, an inventor can patent his or her invention, to make an economic profit from the patent, thus encouraging further invention. However, a patent is territorial. To get an international patent, the invention should be patented several times in all target patent offices, even with the help of international conventions like PCT, leading to inefficiency, expensiveness, and uncertainty. Therefore, we construct an international patent application system based on a permissioned blockchain named PABC. Patent applications can be approved or rejected without relying on one patent office. Each patent office in a country or region manages a peer node of the system, reaching agreements of all the applications. First, we build the model of the system and detail the three-layer architecture of PABC Core. Then, we implement PABC on a permissioned blockchain platform - Hyperledger Fabric. In addition, experiments about its throughput, transaction latency, and failure rate were carried out. The results show that PABC can meet current needs.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,1

Surrounding the fierce debates over emerging gene-edited plant, the current debate focused on the issue of whether the gene-edited crop should be within or outside the GMO law and its implication for innovation. It should not be forgotten that it is also involved in the complex patentability issues pertaining to the legal interpretation of the patent law. The gene-edited crop is governed by GMO regulations due to its potential risk to human health and environmental safety. But it is heavily patented, as patent regulations ignore its potential risk. This article examines the discrepancy of the gene-edited crop between the existing GMO law and the patent law and reveals the challenges to current EU jurisdiction, including the international trade impediment challenge, the patent monopoly challenge, the market confusion challenge, and the agricultural economy suspension challenge. In the end, this article argues that EU GMO regulations should be bridged with a patent system in facing the regulatory challenges from the gene-edited crop.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences,1

In addition, we find that corporate innovative output is power-law distributed in all technological fields. We further find that the power-law distribution of corporate innovative output tends to be stronger (i.e., the concentration of corporate innovative output in a few firms is more pronounced) in technological fields with more abundant technological opportunities and for firms with higher technological competence.",2020,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,1

RECALIBRATING THE DISGORGEMENT REMEDY IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CASES,; PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LIABILITY,"The five major U.S. intellectual property (IP) regimes-trademark, trade secrecy, copyright, design patent, and utility patent (patent) laws-have quite different rules about the availability of disgorgement of infringer profits as a remedy. Traditional principles of restitution and unjust enrichment support awards of disgorgement of profits insofar as they are (1) levied against conscious wrongdoers, (2) attributable to the wrongful conduct, and (3) subject to equitable discretion. Unlike awards of actual damages, which aim primarily to compensate plaintiffs for harms suffered because of a defendant's wrongdoing, disgorgement awards primarily seek to deter wrongdoing by ensuring that wrongdoers do not profit thereby. This Article presents a formal model that supports our judgment that these principles are consistent with the goal of optimal deterrence of IP infringement. This Article presents a close study of the doctrinal structure of the five IP regimes' approach to disgorgement. We find that trademark law is the most consistent of the five regimes with traditional restitutionary principles and the goal of optimal deterrence. Trade secrecy law, like trademark law, is substantially consistent. Design patent, copyright, and patent laws deviate in more significant ways. Disgorgement awards are always available to owners of copyrights or design patents, even against innocent infringers. Moreover, design patent law even deviates from traditional approaches to restricting awards to amounts attributable to infringement. Instead, design patent law requires awards of total profits on the manufacture or sale of whatever article of manufacture to which an infringing design has been applied. Further, courts have rarely recognized that disgorgement awards should be subject to equitable adjustments in copyright and design patent cases, although this may change after the Supreme Court's characterization of disgorgement as an equitable remedy for copyright infringement. Patent law deviates from traditional restitutionary principles in a very different way: courts have ruled that Congress repealed disgorgement as a general remedy for patent infringement in 1946, but patent law's reasonable royalty awards can, in effect, result in a partial disgorgement of infringer profits. This Article concludes by making recommendations about how courts can, within the statutory bounds of each IP regime, render disgorgement awards that are more consistent with traditional restitutionary principles in a manner that will promote the overall goals of the IP laws.",2020,Government & Law,1
"Patents, Governance and Control: Ethics and the Patentability of Novel Beings and Advanced Biotechnologies in Europe",Patents; Patent ethics; biotechnology; novel beings; morality provisions; European patent law; ,"This article focuses primarily on to what extent novel beings, and particularly, beings which display something akin to human consciousness or agency would be (or should be) patentable under current European patent law. Patents grant the patent holder a right to exclude others from using the patented invention for the period of patent grant (usually 20 years). This allows the patent holder to control how that invention can or cannot be used by others downstream, granting patent holders a governance like function over the patented technology for the duration of the patent. Accordingly, the potential for patentability of novel beings gives rise to a myriad of ethical issues including: to what extent is it appropriate for patent holders to retain and exercise patents over novel beings; how issues of agency displayed by any novel beings would fit within the current patent framework, if at all; and to what extent existing exclusions from patentability might exclude patents on novel beings or whether changes within patent law may be needed if patents in relation to novel beings are deemed ethically problematic. This article focuses on such issues, and in doing so, also sheds light on the role of ethical issues within the patenting of advanced biotechnologies more generally.",2021,Health Care Sciences & Services; Biomedical Social Sciences,1

How Fair is Patent Litigation in China? Evidence from the Beijing Courts,intellectual property protection; patent litigation; Beijing courts; inadequate enforcement; trade war; discrimination; damage; LAW,"By conducting field research and analysing judgments delivered in Beijing courts from 2004 to 2011, we find that the popular notion held by China's trade partners of the inadequacy of intellectual property protection is only partly supported by the empirical evidence. The likelihood of winning lawsuits is higher for foreign than domestic plaintiffs and the extremely low damages ruled by Chinese courts are due to particular causes. Courts lack consistent methods to calculate incurred losses in intellectual property right (IPR) infringements and consequently routinely apply the statutory damages whose upper limit is restricted by legislation. Efforts by Chinese legislators to enhance compensation by lifting the upper limit of awardable statutory damages in the Third Amendment of Chinese Patent Law (2008) did not seem to have an effect on our sample. Chinese policymakers should instead focus on the cause of the issue by providing more implementable guidelines for courts to calculate losses. Courts need to develop applicable conventions for calculating damages, based on objective criteria of how much compensation ought to be payable, which is also the basis of calculating reasonable statutory damages. Thus, the new provision of the right of information on pirated goods proposed by the ongoing Fourth Amendment provides a significant weapon to combat counterfeiting.",2020,Area Studies,1
Patenting uncertainty and its impact on innovation: evidence from the United States,Patents; Innovation; Uncertainty; Regulation; Utility patents; Patent applications; Patent grants; Pendency; United States; POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY; INVESTMENT; US,"This paper investigates the effect of patenting uncertainty on innovations. Although the patent system was established to provide incentives and certainty of returns to innovators, the patenting process itself contains elements of uncertainty, including pendency and variation in grant ratios. We use time series data on patent applications and patent grants from the United States and measure patent uncertainty in terms of variation in the grant ratio, i.e., the difference in the number of patent applications and the number of patent grants. Findings show that greater patent uncertainty has a depressing effect on innovation rates. Moreover, our findings reveal important differences between the short-run and long-run effects and between overall patents and utility patents. We also consider the effects of the America Invents Act and find that the Act led to more patent applications. Besides adding to the literature, these findings underscore the point that transaction costs of patenting might be undermining the intent of innovation policy by reducing innovation.",2023,Engineering; Business & Economics,1
Japan's Economic Security Promotion Act: Background and Overview,; ,"On May 11, 2022, the Act for the Promotion of Ensuring National Security through Integrated Implementation of Economic Measures (Act No. 43 of 2022) (Economic Security Promotion Act, hereinafter referred to as the Act) was enacted (promulgated on May 18, 2022). In order to extensively and effectively promote economic measures for national security, the Act formulates a basic policy and establishes a System for Ensuring Stable Supply of Specified Key Products, a System for Ensuring Stable Provision of Essential Infrastructure Services, a System for Enhancing Development of Designated Critical Technologies, and a System for Non-Disclosure of Selected Patent Applications.

Patents and non-invasive prenatal testing: Is there cause for concern?,patents; intellectual property law; access to medicine; prenatal testing; genetic testing; special issue; ,"Intellectual property rights are key to the translation of discoveries into clinical use in personalised medicine. This article explores the interaction of intellectual property rights, specifically patents, with the field of genomic personalised medicine, through empirical work investigating the role that patents play in the development and delivery of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Single gene testing (SGT) and NIPT represent examples of two different types of innovation likely to be important in personalised medicine, and which operate differently in terms of how the law is applied in practice. In SGT, on the one hand, previous studies demonstrate that patents have little impact on practice for those developing genetic tests in the public sector in the UK because they are largely ignored. In contrast, however, this qualitative interview study finds that law and law-in-practice in NIPT are much more convergent than found in SGT. Those involved in the development and delivery of NIPT are more aware of patents, and balance the costs and benefits of greater engagement or compliance with patent law, in relation to factors such as freedom to operate, litigation, and licensing, in favour of compliance. Compliance can take different forms; licensing is compliance, as is forbearance from using a patented invention in the absence of a patent licence. This article explores the factors relevant to patent law compliance in NIPT, and further considers the implications for the field of personalised medicine. It argues that, as the prevalent means to promote openness, access, and affordability in biomedicine are founded on the existing legal structures of intellectual property rights, such solutions will only be effective and adopted when these existing legal structures of intellectual property law are recognised and respected in the relevant field. It is therefore essential that such solutions only be deployed with a nuanced understanding of the operation of the law-in-practice.",2020,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,1

Although some experts have heralded the Bayh-Dole Act as ushering in a new era of technological advances, others have been less sanguine about its impact. In recent years, the high price of prescription drugs and the patenting of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines developed with substantial federal government support have rekindled the debate over whether companies should receive more restricted rights to products originating with government funding. This article traces the history leading to the enactment of the Bayh-Dole Act and critically assesses its strengths and weaknesses as well as unresolved questions concerning its scope. Based on this analysis, the authors propose reforms to better align the BayhDole Act with public values and health outcomes, including clarifying governmentuse rights, making it easier to invoke march-in rights for failure to meet health and safety needs, increasing transparency in how patents are licensed, and testing different approaches to foster the development and application of inventions.",2022,Health Care Sciences & Services; Legal Medicine; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences,1

My analysis relies on shrubs and flowers that may be reaped without a fair and equitable distribution of benefits. My findings highlight that Western pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies' innovations may overlap sovereign states' intellectual property rights, implying that regulatory gaps must be filled to empower local communities to benefit from biodiversity and ecosystem services. Therefore, I suggest that the island adopt effective and consistent access and benefit-sharing policies, including mechanisms that encourage environmental protection and require prior informed consent and mutually agreed terms for utilizing genetic resources. I also suggest the introduction of disclosure of origin and/or source of genetic resources in their respective patents regime to ensure that Convention on Biological Diversity regulations and other related international frameworks can be followed.",2023,Information Science & Library Science,1

These laws impose obstacles against shareholders filing derivative lawsuits, thereby significantly reducing managers' litigation risk. Using a difference-in-differences design and a matched sample, we find that, following the passage of the laws, firms invested more in research and development, produced more patents in new technological classes and more patents based on new knowledge, generated more patents with significant impacts, and achieved higher patent value.

THE SUPREME COURT BAR AT THE BAR OF PATENTS,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; LAW; CERTIORARI; JUSTICES,"Over the past two decades, a few dozen lawyers have come to dominate practice before the U.S. Supreme Court. By many accounts, these elite lawyers-whose clients are often among the largest corporations in the world-have spurred the Court to hear more cases that businesses care about and to decide those cases in favor of their clients. The Supreme Court's recent caselaw on antitrust, arbitration, punitive damages, class actions, and more provides copious examples. Though it is often overlooked in discussions of the emergent Supreme Court bar, patent law is another area in which the Court's agenda has changed significantly in the past twenty years. After rarely hearing patent cases for several decades, the Court now decides three or more patent cases nearly every Term. This Article presents an empirical analysis linking the Supreme Court's increasing interest in patent law to the elite bar's growing involvement in patent litigation. Though correlation does not prove causation, the Article relies on a novel dataset of cert petitions in Federal Circuit patent cases to suggest that the elite bar has, in fact, contributed to the growth of the Supreme Court's patent docket. Among this Article's key findings is that, in patent cases, a cert petition filed by an elite lawyer is three times more likely to be granted than a petition filed by a lawyer outside that group. And although elite lawyers account for only 16% of cert petitions filed in patent cases, their petitions account for a remarkable 40% of the petitions granted. Because patent appeals are centralized in the Federal Circuit, patent law lacks the circuit splits that the law clerks who sift through cert petitions would normally look for in recommending that the Court grant review. But the presence of elite lawyers may not be an ideal proxy for certworthiness. In fact, the increasing participation of those lawyers in patent litigation could help explain why the Court's recent patent cases, though substantial in number, mainly involve issues of jurisdiction, procedure, and statutory interpretation-not the core areas of patent law where the Court's input would be most useful.",2020,Government & Law,1

The Replicability Crisis in Patent Law,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; REPRODUCIBILITY; QUALITY; REPLICATION; LITIGATION; STANDARDS; DISEASE; COULD; DRUGS; MADEY,"There is a replicability crisis in the scientific literature. Scientists attempting to redo experiments in reputable, peer-reviewed journals have found that staggering numbers of these experiments up to 90% do not work. Patents, like scientific articles, contain experiments. These experiments often form the backbone of the patent and provide crucial support for patentability. Patent examiners use these experiments to evaluate whether the invention works, and thus whether the patent should be granted. The replicability crisis in the scientific literature is therefore of utmost importance to the patent system. Transferring the insights of the replicability crisis to patents begs the question of whether experiments in patents are similarly irreplicable-a question that has not previously been asked in the literature. This Article's novel empirical study of 500 patents and applications measures the replicability of experiments in patents. Using methodological quality of the experiment as a proxy for replicability, this study finds that experiments in patents have very poor methodological quality, which means that they are likely irreplicable at rates at least as high as experiments in scientific journals. Given the centrality of experiments to patents, this Article's empirical finding is a crisis not only of replicability, but also of patent law, and has important implications for patent doctrine, theory, and policy. Patent law relies on the assumption that, when a patent is filed, it has been reduced to practice-meaning that the invention works. The reality is that most inventions likely do not work, casting serious doubt on this assumption. Similarly, the underlying justification for patents-incentivizing innovation-requires that they contain enough information to teach others how to make and use the invention. Irreplicable patents may not do this. In short, there is a fundamental mismatch between patent law's theory and doctrine, which treat patents as reflecting fully formulated inventions, and what patents often represent, which is early stage, frequently unproven, results. The replicability literature-and the findings of this Article-teach us that experiments reported in patents are not reliable enough to merit the level of control and influence that they are granted in the patent system. This Article argues that patent law cannot solve irreplicability; instead, patent theory must better reflect the reality of irreplicability. Several policy proposals flow from this reformulation, including easing the process of invalidating inoperable patents, improving disclosure of ex post data in patents, and clarifying the experimental use exception.",2020,Government & Law,1
HATCH-WAXMAN'S RENEGADES,; ACT; LAW,"No intellectual property rights impact society more forcefully than pa-tents on pharmaceuticals. But as a practical matter, only a handful of jurists resolve disputes involving them. Two neighboring federal districts, Dela-ware and New Jersey, adjudicate the vast majority of patent contests be-tween brand-name drug companies and generic manufacturers. And in con-trast to Eastern Texas, which has been persistently derided as a renegade jurisdiction, the authority of the mid-Atlantic courts has seldom been ques-tioned. The complex workings of the Hatch-Waxman Act, the compromise legislation that governs pharmaceutical patent litigation, go a long way to explaining such distinct shareholder reactions to highly similar judicial be-haviors.Yet the dominance of Delaware and New Jersey in pharmaceutical patent litigation may have come to an end. A recent decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Valeant v. Mylan, has narrowed the rules for venue in Hatch-Waxman cases. We are now poised to see mul-tiple, parallel trials involving the same patented pharmaceutical proceed-ing in courts across the country.The new order of pharmaceutical patent litigation affords an oppor-tunity to reconsider an intellectual property environment that aims to pro-mote pharmaceutical innovation but also increase public access to medica-tions. Venue determinations are puzzling in pharmaceutical patent cases due to a concept originating within the Hatch-Waxman Act, the tort of ar-tificial infringement. Artificial infringement occurs when a manufacturer petitions the federal government to obtain permission to market a generic drug. But the federal government both issues patents, and awards regula-tory approval to sell a drug, with effect across the entire nation. Congress gave no thought towards situating artificial infringement at a certain place, and judicial efforts to do so have amounted to a facile and strained exercise.Venue is not artificial infringement's only problem. Artificial infringe-ment also creates disconnects with personal jurisdiction principles, incor-porates obsolete remedial provisions, and fails to comply with the international commitments of the United States. Courts should instead rec-ognize their authority to accept declaratory judgment actions to resolve pharmaceutical patent infringement cases, with legislative abolition of ar-tificial infringement presenting another, preferred possibility.",2023,Government & Law,1
The Research Patent,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; UTILITY REQUIREMENT; ECONOMICS; RETHINKING; SCIENCE; NORMS; LAW; INFRINGEMENT; DISCLOSURE; INNOVATION,"The patent system gives courts the discretion to tailor patentability standards flexibly across technologies to provide optimal incentives for innovation. For chemical inventions, the courts deem them unpatentable if the chemical lacks a practical, non-research-based use at the time patent protection is sought. The fear is that an early-stage patent on a research input would confer too much control over yet-unknown uses for the chemical, thereby potentially hindering downstream innovation. Yet, denying patents on research inputs can frustrate patent law's broad goal of protecting and promoting scientific and technological advances. This Article addresses this problem by proposing a new form of intellectual property a research patent. This regime would allow inventors to obtain patents on research inputs and extract their full value through licensing and enforcement. Research patents would impose minimal administrative costs on the patent system and ultimately promote the disclosure, development, and use of early-stage inventions. At a broader level, the proposed regime raises the theoretical question of how allowing patent protection on early-stage inventions like research inputs serves patent law's instrumental justification of promoting scientific progress. It also raises significant normative and policy questions about technology-specific patentability standards and their role in furthering the goals of the patent system.",2021,Government & Law,1
PROVING PRIORITY: ASSIGNING EMPLOYEE INVENTIONS IN A GLOBAL MARKET,; PATENT; PROPERTY,"Patent rights are territorial. A patent granted in the United States is only enforceable in the United States. Yet increasingly so, a successful launch of new technology or a product requires global strategy, and global strategy requires global patent protection. Seeking patent protection in multiple countries is routine for many companies. And while these multi-national teams of patent counsel and global administrative support are skilled at navigating different patentability requirements and processes, they are currently experiencing a new challenge: defending the priority date of their original patent application when seeking transnational patent protection. Companies are facing this challenge because of differences in patent assignment laws around the world. Patent assignment laws play a crucial role in patent protection, with the majority of patentable inventions around the world created by employees and assigned to employers. This Article demonstrates the interconnection of patent priority around the world by showing how the application of different rules regarding patent assignment law and patent priority currently lead to higher transaction costs and wasteful, if not abusive, litigation. This Article proposes two possible solutions to the global problem of proving patent priority: build a centralized recordation database modeled after the already-existing secured transactions recordation systems in place in almost every country worldwide, or, alternatively, include a disclosure requirement in the already-existing transnational patenting processes.",2020,Government & Law,1
14-Day Limit of Human Embryo Research: Moral Issues in the Patent Law in China,Human embryonic stem cell; 14-day limit; patent law; China; TRIPS,"Conflicting decisions are made regarding the patentability of inventions related to human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in China based on divergent ethical judgments and arguments. Gaps between patent and health law exist, and inconsistent applications of patentability emerge. The amendment to China's Patent Examination Guidelines regulated that isolating or obtaining stem cells using human embryos which are not undergoing in vivo development and are within 14 days after fertilization could be granted patent. This regulatory scheme that uses the 14-day threshold for patenting hESC-related invention is feasible, transparent, and can be conformed with by researchers and other actors in this field. However, making policy on this matter is not straightforwardly a matter of winning a philosophical argument on moral issues: the moral status of human embryos must be still carefully weighed and balanced in the patent examination process.",2021,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1
A Serendipitous Experiment in Percolation of Intellectual Property Doctrine,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; SUPREME-COURT; PATENT-LAW; ATTORNEYS FEES; APPEALS; RECOVERY; ACT,"What do we sacrifice when we put our faith in a specialized patent court? This article breaks new ground by identifying and investigating a serendipitous natural experiment in the development of intellectual property doctrine under a specialized versus a percolating court system that allows us to address the trade-offs inherent in court structures. Since 1982, all patent-related appeals from district courts and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have been channeled to a single, specialized appellate court: the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Only the U.S. Supreme Court has more say on patent issues, and its intervention is necessarily rare. The Federal Circuit was established to eliminate the inconsistency that develops when multiple appellate courts weigh in on an issue, as is the norm in most other areas of the law. Notwithstanding the importance of doctrinal uniformity, scholars have pointed out that multi-court percolation of issues has important advantages as well, such as reducing judicial hyperactivity and activism. However, if U.S. patent law suffers from the lack of percolation, there have not been concrete examples to date; there has been only theory and speculation on this point. A key predicate to our investigation is the fact that the patent and trademark statutes have identical language related to fee shifting, but only the latter currently percolates. Leveraging these contrasting jurisprudential states, our article assesses six decades of patent and trademark case law to understand the impact of these two conditions on doctrinal formation. The empirical evidence uncovered is powerful and provides a novel understanding of a fundamental problem in common law legal theory and policy. Significantly, we find that percolation does indeed have clear advantages it is more likely to result in doctrine that preserves the function of the trial court and avoids inappropriate policy making. We track how Federal Circuit doctrine moved further and further from that formed through percolation among the regional circuits until the Supreme Court's 2014 fee-shifting decisions reined in the Federal Circuit and forced its interpretation of the statutory language back toward the path pursued by the generalist circuit courts in the trademark area. The empirical evidence thus provides powerful evidence that, regardless of the importance of uniformity, there is a trade-off for investing a specialized court with the sole power of statutory interpretation.",2020,Government & Law,1
A Study on Anglo-American Equity Law Applied to Litigation and Arbitration in Taiwan's Patent Dispute Solutions,Globalization; Transnational Law; Equality Law; Arbitration; Judge-Made Law; ,"Influenced by globalization trends, legal regulations and dispute resolutions are converging under the influence of WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The formation of transnational law has since developed. Whether the national legal system can be effectively integrated into transnational law and whether the public support of its outputs can remain dynamically balanced are critical issues facing modern countries. Since this paper aims to analyze patent dispute solutions in Taiwan's high tech industry, this research uses the patent equity of Anglo-American law to explore whether it is possible for a Taiwanese arbitration court to cite equitable arbitration in the future, as well as to discuss whether Taiwan's IP court can cite the judge-made laws of US state supreme courts. This approach may lead to the creation of a theory on patent equity for legal proceedings. To investigate the possibility that Taiwanese arbitration courts will be able to quote the applicable laws concerning Anglo-American law in equality law (Amiable Composition), this paper uses document analysis as its research method. In addition, the possibility that the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court will be able to create sub-principles of patent equity in accordance with judge-made laws from the US Federal Supreme Court will be investigated herein.",2022,Government & Law,1

We show why having competitors bid as a single unit is better than having competitors bid against each other. More important, we show that collusive bidding on patents held by NPEs, even when the patents are not essential for a standard (SEPs), may increase consumer surplus, particularly when technological innovation is drastic, and improve social welfare. This provides a theoretical foundation that explains why competition authorities often allow collusive bidding for patents and why courts employ the rule of reason to analyze agreements under competition law. We also show that a cartel of incumbents will always outbid a potential entrant, or a patent assertion entity, over a technology that can destroy the value of the incumbents' existing assets.",2023,Government & Law,1
SEPs infringement and competition law defence in German case law,standard essential patents; competition law; patent infringement; FRAND; willing licensee; injunctive relief; ,"Within the debate on the role of competition law in standard essential patents (SEPs) litigation, German case law has taken centre stage because of the number of decisions handed down and its traditional patent-owner-friendly approach.

The article maintains that the Federal Court ' s rulings in Einwand have aligned German case law with the Huawei framework and that the attention devoted in German case law to the implementer ' s obligations is consistent with the principles set out by the CJEU.

Yet, empirical studies show that patenting rates around the world are gendered. This article analyses the roots of the gender patent gap, and how this correlates to the invention and innovation processes. It shows that the gendered nature of the patent-regulated knowledge governance system forces women into traditionally male spaces and fields in order to partake in the extant patent game. Yet, when they enter those spaces and fields, they often find themselves unwelcome and subject to institutional, structural or organizational biases, which impinge upon their ability to invent, patent and commercialize. This article re-frames the discourse around women inventors. It argues that we have to stop focusing on the 'women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)' narrative, because it is a distraction from the underlying problem that the Western knowledge governance system reflects the hegemonic powers at play. Instead, we need to re-think the knowledge governance system and the ecosystem it creates, in order to ensure egalitarian knowledge production and protection.",2020,Government & Law,1

Can antitrust law enforcement spur innovation?

Our reconciliation of the various strains of literature hypothesizes that in sectors where cumulative innovation is crucial to firms' market operations, a firm that consolidates patents for substituting technologies for its already-possessed technologies discourages market competitions and follow-on innovation by competitors. In this case, antitrust regulation of patent consolidation is anticipated to positively affect competitors' follow-on innovation. We empirically test this hypothesis with the case of the US Department of Justice's regulation of Novell's software patent transfers to four large proprietary software companies (i.e., Microsoft, Oracle, EMC, and Apple) in 2011. Our analyses using US patent, trademark, and copyright data have found evidence corroborating our hypothesis.

"Hello, World? Domestic Software Patent Protection Stands Alone Due to Uncertain Subject Matter Eligibility Jurisprudence",; NEED; LAW,"In the last sixteen years, software-related inventions have encompassed the majority of all utility patents issued in the United States. Further, studies estimate that spending within the global information technology market will grow to $4.6 trillion in 2023, as industries such as data security, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence continue to innovate and expand at alarming rates. Needless to say, software is a crucial and ever-expanding industry for the global economy. In a series of recent cases, however, the Supreme Court injected unpredictability into the patenting of software and computer-implemented inventions by overhauling the long-standing patentable subject matter doctrine. Embodied in 101 of the Patent Act, the patentable subject matter requirement for patent protection refers to the basic substantive categories of invention that Congress and the courts have considered to be appropriate for patenting. The Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence has massively expanded subject matter eligibility restrictions under 101, thereby making it more difficult to obtain patent protection for certain types of inventions-notably, software inventions. As software patents have become more difficult to obtain and even more difficult to protect, the current patentable subject matter jurisprudence disparately harms small-scale inventors and startups who are reliant on the patent system to obtain crucial private capital from investors to support further innovation. Such issues are made glaringly apparent when comparing the domestic patentable subject matter jurisprudence to that of other technologically developed foreign nations, whose patent systems are more predictable and rewarding for software inventors. The Supreme Court's recent pivot has been met with substantial criticism by members of the intellectual property community across the political spectrum. Politicians, academics, district court and Federal Circuit judges, inventors, and former United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Directors have criticized the Supreme Court's framework and have urged Congress to act. Sparked by a recent denial for rehearing en banc wherein the Federal Circuit was evenly divided on the contours of 101, followed by the Supreme Court's refusal to grant certiorari, senators and prominent law organizations pitched legislative proposals on the Senate floor to abrogate the Supreme Court's framework and better protect emerging technologies, including software. This Note pushes the need for legislative revision to counteract the negative effects of the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence on the software industry and better align the United States with consistent global standards. Specifically, this Note thoroughly analyzes the history of the patentable subject matter doctrine, domestic proposals aimed at dismantling the current jurisprudence, and the way foreign patent systems handle patent eligibility restrictions for software inventions, to argue that domestic software innovation is disparately and negatively harmed by the Supreme Court's evolving framework for evaluating subject matter eligibility. Software innovation is paramount to the development of modern society, and thus the patent system should stand to support the patentability of software inventions, rather than hinder it.",2023,Government & Law,1
Perverse Results from Pharmaceutical Patents in the United States,Pharmaceutical patents; Patent policy; Competition law policy; ,"In the United States, pharmaceutical patents have had a number of perverse and anticompetitive effects on the development and marketing of prescription drugs. Although some of these effects are unique to the United States, others have implications for patent policy across the world. Among the negative effects of drug patents are: (1) examples of misguided, anti-social, and anticompetitive promotion of patented drugs; (2) misguided incentives that push drug firms toward too much or too little research and development in critical areas: and (3) cartel-facilitating conduct linked to patent licenses or settlements of litigation involving drug patents. Some of these issues can be addressed directly through reforms in patent and competition law policy. There is, however, a need for a broader study of the role of patents in promoting drug research.

In some cases, however, the inventions in question reveal considerable risks for the rights of individuals, but also for society as such, which have a hitherto unknown dimension and which have not been discussed so far. Due to the limited scope of application of the ordre public clause, patent law is fundamentally not in a position to respond adequately to the challenges that exist here. The ratio of patent law and the lack of resources and also, above all, competence of the patent offices for a more extensive ethico-legal analysis mean that patent law is not the right setting for dealing with the existing challenges.

PATENT LAW'S ROLE IN PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH,; COLORECTAL-CANCER; FAIR-USE; RISK; SUPPLEMENTS; INVENTIONS; VEGETABLES; PARADIGMS; BRASSICA; SYSTEM,"Innumerable inventions implicate public health-including drugs, vaccines, dietary supplements, and sewage treatment plants. Over the past century, the Patent Office and the courts have modulated the ability to obtain or enforce patents for these inventions-whether in response to a public health crisis or to protect the credulous public from unscrupulous inventors. While normative and policy-based arguments can justify these interventions, they've disrupted the delicate balance of two competing policy objectives in patent law- enhancing public welfare and promoting innovation. This Article offers a new approach for courts to protect public health in patent cases-by making public health an affirmative defense to infringement. If the patent owner has engaged in invention-related egregious misconduct that's jeopardized public health, the court could render the patent unenforceable by dismissing the lawsuit. Or the court could render the patent temporarily unenforceable until the misconduct ceases and its ill effects on public health dissipate. This proposal aligns with the increasing use of equitable remedies in patent disputes and raises interesting normative and policy questions about the role of public health issues in patent law.",2024,Government & Law,1

Intellectual property laws like copyright, patent, and confidential commercial information law facilitate can increase business outputs, economic growth, and green production standards. The objective of the article is to analyze copyright, patent, and confidential commercial information laws in Saudi Arabia to see the availability of these laws in encouraging and protecting energy -efficient innovation while contributing to achieving sustainable development. Content analysis, doctrinal research method, and comparative legal analysis were used to achieve the research objective. The research findings demonstrate that the three selected legislation could be extended to protect energy -efficient innovation in Saudi Arabia though there is a need to amend some of the provisions of the existing laws. However, creating public awareness of the availability of laws and proper implementation of the laws are necessary to protect energy -efficient innovation. The article proposes recommendations to the policymakers about the need for further improvement of the law and its enforcement. The findings of this research could fill the gap in the literature on the assessment of intellectual property law to protect energy -efficient innovation in Saudi Arabia.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Biopharmaceutical patent protection vs. generic drug competition: Traversing the public policy tightrope,; ,"The Support Technology & Research for Our Nation's Growth and Economic Resilience (STRONGER) Patents Act, introduced in the 115th Congress, focuses on inter partes review (IPR) and post-grant review (PGR) proceedings that challenge patent validity at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB). Quinn, Brachmann, Malone, and Morinville (2018) evaluated patent data for the PTAB covering the first five plus years (through 2017) of the PTAB's operations, and calculate an 82.5% defect rate, i.e., where at least one patent claim is determined invalid and thus the invention not patentable. This finding could signal serious problems either with patent examination quality at the USPTO or with an aggressive PTAB. For recommended future research, further analysis of more recent (2018-21) patent-related validity data should be undertaken, as well as investigating the impact of the recently enacted CREATES Act on the relative strength of biopharmaceutical patent protection.",2022,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,1

Pharmaceutical patents: Cathartic or inhibiting,health; industry; Intellectual Property Law; patents; ,"The debate between patent rights of pharmaceutical firms and the rights of the poor to equal access to health is an old one. The basic purpose of any patent system that grants a temporary monopoly to an innovator is to stimulate innovation and investment in the production of the newly innovated goods and services, which in turn gives supernormal profits to the innovator. However, the equity considerations dictate the spread of this knowledge in the public domain. The dilemma of the patent system is that, in encouraging R&D, it prevents the diffusion of innovation and consequently creates a non-competitive situation. This paper examines the impact of patent protection on the number of patent filings by the pharmaceutical companies in India after it signed the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and the trend in research and development expenditure by domestic firms. It questions the basis of this intellectual property right, especially, when a substantial amount of basic research is often carried out in the universities and federal funding is provided at the basic research and development level. It further investigates the success of various flexibilities provided under TRIPS which the Indian Patent Act has used and can potentially use, in comparison to other developed countries, to provide easy access to the medicines. The paper concludes by exploring other options available during public health emergencies and otherwise.",2024,Government & Law,1

"Some critical observations on depository, non-examination patent registration regimes: working towards local prosecution and examination of patents in the least-developed patent regimes",; COMPULSORY LICENSES; INVENTIONS; SYSTEM; MODEL,"Even with its ambitious patent standards, Trade Related-Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) still failed to deal with procedural matters concerning the scope, conditions and guidelines for granting patents. This failure leaves members free to choose the medium and formalities for prosecuting patents and deciding on their grant. The two most successful patent regimes-the US and the European Patent Convention regimesoperate a substantive examination system where patent applications are scrutinized to determine whether they meet the patentability standards. However, the least-developed patent regimes commonly use a depository, non-examination patent registration system where the granting of patents does not entail local examination. Although substantive examination systems are not immune to invalidly granted patents, a convincing assumption in the literature implies that the number of invalid patents is higher in countries that operate a depository, non-examination patent registration system. This article assesses the context and implications of the depository, non-examination patent registration system and questions whether countries that operate such a system should attempt to consider examining patent applications locally. It discusses whether highly developed patent regimes would be able to discharge their TRIPS obligation to provide technical cooperation in favour of the least-developed patent regimes to build capacity towards the local prosecution of patents.",2023,Government & Law,1

This rapidly evolving technological advancement needs a legal framework in order to obtain social and commercial status. Patent Law is the legal science and patent is the legal tool that adds value to intangible assets and therefore technology scientists are motivated to ensure their invention with a patent and also dominant technology enterprises are competing for the development of a strong patent portfolio. For the first time in Greece, combining the fields of intellectual property law and technological innovation, we created a survey using a questionnaire that was distributed in 2019, to graduated students of technology institutes in Greece. The purpose of the present survey is to clarify the knowhow of students as for the legal point of view of technology. We intend to find out, whether Greece& x2019;s potential inventors have beyond their technological background, the skills and knowledge to support a potential innovative idea. The results of the survey were that students have confidence in the institution of patents; however they lack the knowledge of patenting technological inventions. At the same time they have a positive attitude and motivation for entrepreneurship in the technological industry. Consequently, it is vital to apply measures in education, for the next generation technical inventors to have the knowhow of utilizing their intellectual asset in their own free will. Then, we can refer to integrated scientist technocrats who can protect their intellectual property and manage a competitive business.",2020,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,1

The accelerated disclosures instituted by the AIPA may benefit innovative firms by either reducing duplicative R&D projects or by facilitating prompt, beneficial knowledge spillovers among firms. However, early innovation disclosures may result in proprietary costs and reduce competitive advantages. Our results indicate that when firms engage in quality innovation as captured by patent citations or originality, they have more efficient innovation output after the passage of the AIPA, and their innovation output is more strongly associated with future earnings.",2022,Business & Economics,1
"Patent Law and the Materiality of Inventions in the California Oil Industry: The Story of Halliburton v. Walker, 1935-1946",patent law; oil industry; materiality; competition; technology; innovation; ,"This article examines a patenting conflict between the Halliburton Oil Well and Cementing Company and an independent inventor named Cranford Walker. It argues that Halliburton's effort to lower the barriers to entry into the oil well depth measurement industry facilitated the re-emergence of materiality as a pre-condition for the patent eligibility of inventive processes. In 1941, Walker sued Halliburton for infringement of three of his patents, and Halliburton responded with an aggressive defense aimed at invalidating them. Over the next five years, the courts handling this conflict adopted very narrow legal theories developed during the Second Industrial Revolution to assess the patent eligibility of inventions that involved mental steps-processes such as mathematical computations, which people can perform in their minds. The resulting legal precedent cleared the path for Halliburton's short-term industrial goals and continued to shape patent law for the rest of the century.",2023,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
"Patenting Personalized Medicine Molecules, Information, and the Body",; PROTECTION; LAW,"The histories of patent law and medical practice in the United States have intersected in various ways over the past 150 years, beginning with the professional campaign against patent medicines in the late nineteenth century, and culminating, for now, in attempts to patent the diagnostic procedures discussed in this article. The patenting of diagnostic procedures provokes a set of fundamental questions about the episteme of patent law. These questions are not new. They emerged at the very origins of patent jurisprudence, centered on the question of what distinguished an invention from a law of nature, and this question of patentability has persistently reemerged over the past century in the contexts of plant breeding, biotechnology, and now diagnostic medicine. So far, the question has been addressed in terms that imagine the invention as a machine, understood in the figurative sense of a transformative organization of forces and elements. But diagnostic procedures, because they address the body informationally, as a system based on the recursive patterning of signals rather than a linear transformation of inputs into outputs, stretch the figure of the machine to the point at which it ceases to be effective. How then should one define and delimit invention?",2021,History & Philosophy of Science,1
RETHINKING THE PRESUMPTION OF ENABLEMENT IN NONPATENT PRIOR ART,; PATENTS; INFORMATION,"The rising popularity of tools such as preprint servers, open-access data sources, and generative artificial intelligence has resulted in a proliferation of prior art that has never been seen before under the current patent system. In a rapidly changing world, patent law is slow to catch up, and the current system is not equipped to handle the flood of incoming prior art. In the academic research setting in particular, while the use of preprint servers and open-source data has allowed researchers to participate in widespread information exchange, these tools have also generated a new, large class of prior art dedicated to early-stage research. This creates a tension with patent law, which assigns a presumption of enablement to nonpatent prior art, including preprint disclosures. Essentially, the law presumes that any public disclosure of an invention contains enough detail to instruct the public to make and use it. Thus, any public disclosure starts the clock on an applicant's time to get to the patent office. This Note explores how that presumption artificially incentivizes premature patent filing, decreasing the overall quality of patents entering the patent system.",2024,Government & Law,1
Patenting New Uses for Old Inventions,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; RETHINKING; HISTAMINE; ECONOMICS; LAW; PRESUMPTION; DISCOVERY; BURDENS; RIGHTS,"A bedrock principle of patent law is that old inventions cannot be patented. And a new use for an old invention does not render the old invention patentable. This is because patent law requires novelty-an invention must be new. But while a new use for an old invention does not make the old invention patentable, the new use itself might be patentable. In fact, new-use patents comprise a significant part of the patent landscape-particularly in pharmaceuticals, when drug companies obtain new-use patents to repurpose old drugs. This trend has fueled debates over follow-on innovation and patent quality. But there is a problem with new-use patents that has escaped the attention of legal scholars and commentators. The problem is when an inventor seeks a new-use patent for an old product that is, on close inspection, not new because the old product is really doing the same thing that it did before. This is a technical question that requires some understanding of the underlying science-how and why a result is achieved. But various evidentiary rules, biases, and perfunctory views of novelty preclude a true and accurate patentability assessment. Sometimes this leads to unwarranted patents; other times it derails meritorious inventions. This Article corrects this problem by offering a new framework for evaluating novelty in new-use patent claims. It proposes a probing novelty inquiry that would require inventors to elucidate and disclose mechanistic information to prove that a claimed new use is truly novel. Providing mechanistic information would promote patent law's disclosure function and improve patent (examination) quality. At a broader level, this Article raises the normative and theoretical question of what it means to be identical-which is what novelty is all about. It also raises policy questions about novelty's gatekeeping function and its role in promoting broader goals of the patent system.",2020,Government & Law,1

This article addresses this lacuna, examining the legal, commercial, and ethical implications of patenting de-extinct animals under European patent law. The article is organized into four parts. Part I explores the reasons why patents are relevant and may be applied for in this context. Part II provides an overview of the scientific techniques currently being used in de-extinction projects, setting the foundation for the analysis of patentability which follows. Part III then critically assesses whether recreated animals would qualify as patent eligible subject matter under European patent law. It also investigates the extent to which European patent exclusions such as those on animal varieties, essentially biological processes, and the morality provisions might apply and whether recreated animals would meet the novelty requirement for patentability. Part IV concludes by highlighting the possible ramifications of patenting such animals, elucidating the chasm between the cultural and symbolic significance held by such animals, and their lack of differential treatment in the patent law sphere. It argues that de-extinction reignites questions around the scope of patents, and the role of ethical considerations within patent decision-making which warrant urgent reconsideration.",2021,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,1
Quis custodet custodes? Referral G-3/19 before the EPO Enlarged Board of Appeal and the imperative of challenging the board's interpretation of Art. 53(b) EPC,European; patents; plants; ,"The European Patent Office Enlarged Board of Appeal was asked in April 2019 to answer two questions regarding the exclusions from patentability under Art. 53 European Patent Convention (EPC), the dominant patent law in Europe. The first related to the manner in which EPC Articles should be interpreted, and the second to whether Art. 53 EPC excluded plants and animals that are the products of the excluded essentially biological processes. Since product claims are infringed by all processes for making the product, the second question was important-if the products are patentable, the exclusion of the processes is rendered meaningless, something which cannot have been the intention of the legislators drafting the EPC. The questions are in case G-3/19 Peppers and the Enlarged Board of Appeal handed down its opinion on May 14, 2020. In this paper we examine the background to this case, the strength of the arguments presented, and the Enlarged Board's decision which we find to dangerously undermine the Article of the EPC, Art. 164 EPC, which requires changes to the principles of what can be patentable to be democratically agreed by the parliaments of the EPC member states rather than by an administrative body of government-appointees.",2020,Government & Law,1

Antitrust Enforcement in the Pharmaceutical Industry: Analyzing Patents Under the Rule of Reason,; ,"American consumers and lawmakers across the political spectrum agree that prescription drug prices are far too high. This Note identifies an antitrust cause of action that could drastically reduce the prices of the most expensive prescription drugs. Under section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (Section 1), all agreements that unreasonably restrain trade are illegal. Patents are agreements between inventors and the public, and under antitrust rule of reason analysis, some patents, i.e., patents covering lifesaving medicines for which there are no close substitutes, may unreasonably restrain trade and therefore violate Section 1. The rule of reason analysis in this Note weighs the long-term economic benefits of robust patent protection against the relatively short-term economic inefficiencies of patent protection. While the benefits of patents almost always outweigh the harms, patents on lifesaving medicines for which there are no close substitutes are economically unique. Demand for these medicines remains immense, regardless of how high prices climb, because patients need them to live. Prices soar, sometimes to millions of dollars per dose, and the public ultimately shoulders the cost. This Note argues that under Section 1 rule of reason analysis, the patents that enable these extraordinarily high prices may unreasonably restrain trade. For now, the antitrust action proposed in this Note is likely unavailable under Supreme Court precedents that appear to immunize patents from antitrust scrutiny. This Note suggests amendments to federal law that would abrogate patents' implicit antitrust immunity and, where a Section 1 violation is proven, provide for compulsory patent licensing to generic drugmakers for a reasonable royalty. These amendments could save Americans billions annually on prescription drugs while preserving pharmaceutical companies' incentives to develop new medicines.",2024,Government & Law,1

Patent protection in the laws of Iran and the emphasis of European Union on the TRIPS agreement,patent rights; TRIPS Agreement; comparative analysis; Iranian laws; European Union; ,"The patent right and the inventor's exploitation of his own thought and initiative represent a financial right which can be traded. However, as this right is immaterial and intangible, ownership cannot be claimed merely by possessing it physically. Instead, the rightful owner should be the first individual who achieved it through hard work and effort, enabling them to benefit from it exclusively and prevent imitators from utilizing the inventor's efforts freely and without exertion. Registering a patent in the inventor's name becomes crucial as it serves as proof that the holder is the original person who successfully conceived the invention, establishing their rightful ownership. Therefore, patents and other intangible assets play a vital role in establishing the ownership of inventors. The purpose of this article is to familiarize inventors with patent procedures and emphasize the importance of registering their patents to ensure protection. It also reviews and studies the patent protection systems in the laws of Iran and the European Union. The research concludes that in order to accept the TRIPS agreement and join the World Trade Organization, considerable efforts are required, which include aligning domestic laws concerning inventions with international regulations, such as those of the World Trade Organization.

We take advantage of the passage of the American Inventor's Protection Act (1999), which mandates the pre-grant public disclosure of all information in patent application documents within 18 months of the initial filings. We find that, on average, the pre-grant patent disclosure of corporate inventions significantly improves the accuracy of analyst forecasts about the patenting firm and this improvement is greater for firms with higher research and development intensity. Nevertheless, improvements in the accuracy of analysts' forecasts are smaller when firms issue more original and scientifically broader patents.

Forfeiting IP,; TRADE SECRETS; PATENT; COPYRIGHT; IGNORANCE; ECONOMICS; COSTS; LAW,"Can IP rights be lost? That is, once IP rights are acquired, what-if anything-must owners do to keep those rights or risk forfeiting them. The answer varies widely across the IP landscape and has important consequences for follow-on innovation, competition, and the public domain. This article takes the first close look at forfeiture mechanisms throughout the five major IP regimes-utility patent, trade secret, copyright, design patent, and trademark. I demonstrate how IP forfeiture mechanisms (e.g., maintenance fees, monitoring obligations, and use requirements) have weakened or narrowed over time. Building on prior scholarship, I also delineate the important functions that IP forfeiture mechanisms serve. By forcing IP owners to decide if the cost and effort of maintaining IP rights are worthwhile, forfeiture mechanisms help eliminate low-value IP rights and enlarge the public domain, benefiting follow-on innovators and society at large. In addition, forfeiture mechanisms serve an important notice or signaling role by forcing owners to engage in acts that inform second comers about the existence and scope of IP rights. These functions are particularly important when it comes to functional or useful subject matter (e.g., innovations that make a product work). Given forfeiture's role and its problematic narrowing across the IP landscape, I suggest the need for reform-particularly in design patent and copyright law, two areas that increasingly cover functional subject matter but lack any forfeiture mechanism.",2022,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1

Mayo, Myriad, and the battles over patent-eligibility",Inherited risk of cancer; patents; molecular diagnostics; genetic testing; coverage and reimbursement; CLINICAL LABORATORIES; GENE PATENTS; INNOVATION; CLAIMS,"Genetic testing for inherited cancer risk changed dramatically when the US Supreme Court handed down unanimous rulings in Mayo v. Prometheus (2012) and Myriad v. Association for Molecular Pathology (2013). Those decisions struck down claims to methods based on 'laws of nature' (Mayo) and DNA molecules corresponding to sequences found in nature (Myriad). Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Christopher Coons (D-DE) introduced legislation that would abrogate those decisions and specify narrow statutory exclusions to patent-eligibility in 101 of the US Patent Act. What would be the consequences of doing so? The Supreme Court decisions coincided with changes in how genetic tests were performed, reimbursed and regulated. Multi-gene sequencing supplanted oligo-gene testing as the cost of sequencing dropped 10,000-fold. Payers dramatically changed reimbursement practices. Food and Drug Administration regulation was proposed and remains in prospect. Databases for clinical interpretation made data freely available, augmenting a knowledge commons. The spectacular implosion of Theranos tempered investment in molecular diagnostics. These factors all complicate explanations of why venture capital funding for molecular diagnostics dropped relative to other sectors. Restoring patent-eligibility would put renewed pressure on other patent doctrines, such as obviousness, enablement and written description, that were not raised in the Supreme Court cases.",2024,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,1

The analysis exploits the Invention Secrecy Act, which grants the U.S. Commissioner for Patents the right to prevent the disclosure of new inventions that represent a threat to national security. Using a two-level matching approach, we document a negative and large relationship between the enforcement of a secrecy order and follow-on inventions, as captured with patent citations and text-based measures of invention similarity. The effect carries over to after the lift of the secrecy period, suggesting a lost generation of inventions.

Does Compulsory Schooling Affect Innovation? Evidence from the United States,; PATENTS; WORKER; OUTPUT; LAWS; ATTENDANCE,Objective U.S. states adopted compulsory schooling laws between 1852 and 1929. This is the first study to empirically test the historical relationship between the adoption of state-level compulsory schooling laws and measures of innovation and entrepreneurship such as the number of patents per capita and output per worker. Methods We use difference-in-difference and event study methods to estimate the effects of these laws. Results Our results suggest that the adoption of compulsory schooling in the United States reduced patents per capita and output per worker over time. Conclusion Compulsory schooling laws may have reduced innovation and productivity by reducing home education in favor of formal schooling or by changing the nature of formal schooling.,2020,Government & Law; Sociology,1

Employing the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA) that accelerated the publication of patent applications, we find that accelerated dissemination of patenting information increases stock price crash risk. This effect is stronger when treated firms are technologically closer to their rival firms and more concerned about proprietary costs. Further analyses indicate that, the heightened crash risk following the AIPA is attributable to managers shifting towards less timely bad news disclosures. Overall, our study documents that accelerated dissemination of patenting information induces managers to strategically withhold negative information, which adds to the comprehension of what and how (un)ethical decisions are undertaken by managers.",2024,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,1

It remains even unclear as to whether the harmonization of the IPR system spurs international trade. The present study argues that institutional harmonization in terms of knowledge production plays an important role in trade of patent-sensitive goods, considering the fact that trade in patent-sensitive goods is heavily concentrated in trade between developed countries. This study empirically examines the relationship between harmonization of patent rights systems and international trade flow based on world bilateral trade data during 1995-2010. Differently to methods of previous studies on this topic, this study uses a structural gravity model based on a translog demand system that is more flexible than constant elasticity of substitution type preferences. The results reveal that institutional distance in terms of patent law has an inverted U-shaped relationship with bilateral trade share in patent-sensitive industries, suggesting similarity in patent systems of exporters and importers raises bilateral trade. This result is robust to the model with additional variables that affect trade costs.",2023,Business & Economics,1

PATENTS' NEW SALIENCE,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; RATIONAL IGNORANCE; DECISION-MAKING; INNOVATION; SCIENCE; LAW; INFRINGEMENT; INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY,"The vast majority of patents do not matter. They are almost never enforced or licensed and, in consequence, are almost always ignored. This is a well-accepted feature of the patent system and has a tremendous impact on patent policy. In particular, while there are many aspects of patent law that are potentially troubling-including grants of unmerited patents, high transaction costs in obtaining necessary patent licenses, and patents' potential to block innovation and hinder economic growth-these problems may be insignificant in practice because patents are under-enforced and routinely infringed without consequence.This Article argues that technological developments are greatly increasing the salience of patents by making patents easier and cheaper to find and enforce. These developments-including private platforms' adjudication systems and AI-driven patent analytics-profoundly impact how the patent system functions and upend the systems present dependence on under-enforcement and ignorance. Where most patents could previously be safely disregarded, formerly forgotten patents now matter.This Article makes four contributions to the literature. First, this Article explores the technology that is rendering patents newly salient and explains how this alters basic assumptions underlying the patent system. Second, this Article demonstrates that although new technology is increasing the number of patents that can be reviewed and enforced, this transformation sometimes decreases the depth of patent analysis. Because it is difficult to draw conclusions about patent scope or validity without in-depth analysis, this omission means that technological review of patents may give patents unmerited influence.Third, this Article shows a sharp divergence between public policy goals and private use of patents. For several decades, the courts and Congress have been reforming patent policy to decrease the impact of patents to alleviate concerns that patent owners hinder innovation by others. This Article demonstrates, in clear contrast to this goal, an increase in patent salience that is due exclusively to the use of private platforms and technologies. Further, the use of private platforms to find, analyze, and enforce patents creates the risk that choices made by companies and software developers will displace substantive patent law. Finally, this Article suggests policy reform, including ways to improve technology and patents and adjusted approaches to patent doctrine and theory.",2023,Government & Law,1
From Banks to Shanks: the history of employee awards for patented inventions under the Patents Act 1977,employee inventions; awards to inventors; Patents Act 1977; patent history; ,"The introduction of statutory awards for inventors in the Patents Act 1977 was highly controversial. Using original archival sources and parliamentary debates, the political battles that raged both in public and behind the scenes are explored. Central to the policy development was a report by a government-appointed Working Party; yet, until now, this report and its recommendations have not been published. The report represents a compromise agreement between representatives of both employers and employees. It was used by the government as the main defence of its policy. Using this report, and the contemporary political discussions, the small number of decisions of the comptroller and the courts will be examined to see if they reflect the balance struck by the Working Party, thereby providing a history of statutory employee awards in the United Kingdom as they have evolved over the last fifty years.",2021,Government & Law,1
Environmental regulation and green innovation: Evidence from China's new environmental protection law,Environmental regulation; Green innovation; China's new environmental protection law; Patents application; IMPACT; COMPETITIVENESS; PERFORMANCE; DECENTRALIZATION; DETERMINANTS; PRODUCTIVITY; ISOMORPHISM; FEDERALISM; HYPOTHESIS; DYNAMICS,"This study investigates the impact of China's new Environmental Protection Law on the green innovation behaviour of listed companies in high-polluting industries. The implementation of China's strict and new Environmental Protection Law provides a quasi-natural experimental setting for examining the causal effect of environmental regulation on corporate green innovation. Based on data of the application for environmental patents of high-polluting firms listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2010 to 2017, this study analyses the change in the green innovation behaviour of firms after the implementation of China's new and stringent Environmental Protection Law using the PSM-DID approach. We find that firms tend to file more applications for environmental patents, including patents for inventions and utility models after the implementation of the new Environmental Protection Law. Further analysis shows that while this effect is stronger for state-owned enterprises, it is weaker for firms headquartered in cities where economies depend more on the secondary industry. Firms in concentrated industries have more incentive to file applications for green invention patents than those in competitive industries. The study has important implications for policy makers on better implementing the environmental protection law in developing countries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Looking at Patent Law: Patenting a Solid State Lithium-Metal Battery - A Case Study,Election; Restriction; Divisional Patent Application; Solid State Lithium-Metal Battery; ,"In this installment of the Looking at Patent Law series, we present a case study of the prosecution of a patent directed towards Pulse Plating of Lithium Material in Electrochemical Devices assigned to QuantumScape Corp. of San Jose, CA. This case was chosen to coincide with the focus of this issue of Interface on solid state energy conversion. The case illustrates overcoming novelty rejections by conducting an examiner interview to clearly understand the prior art issue and amending the claims accordingly to distinguish from the prior art. In addition, the case includes an election/restriction requirement due to multiple inventions claimed in the original patent application. This requirement resulted in three distinct patent applications with two patents issued and the third patent application currently pending. Finally, the case illustrates the factors considered in a non-publication request. With this case study, we hope to demystify the patent prosecution process and better prepare electrochemical and solid state scientists, engineers, and technologists to interact with their patent counsel regarding their inventions.

"Patent Injunctions, Economics, and Rights",; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; NATURAL LAW; DEFENSE; WEALTH,"Richard Epstein has long defended classical liberalism, property rights, and private ordering, including the presumption that a patent owner deserves an injunction against ongoing infringement. We agree with Epstein that injunctions should be a presumptive remedy for infringement, but we have reservations about his consequentialist, law and economics justification for this position. Law and economics justifications struggle to explain why the state may use coercion and the implied threat of force to enforce policies written into law. By contrast, rights-based justifications can supply such an explanation, and we illustrate by showing how a Lockean theory of rights based in a metaethics of flourishing (eudaimonism) justifies both a patent and an injunctive remedy for violations of a patent. We also address misconceptions that Epstein and other consequentialists hold toward rights-based justifications: that such justifications make policy prescriptions without considering social consequences and that they are not as determinate as consequentialist justifications.",2021,Government & Law,1
Identification of US-pharmaceutical patents expiring between 2018 and 2022 and their effect on the Brazilian domestic market,"Pharmaceutical patents; Brazilian industrial property law; LPI 9,279/96; INPI backlog; Patent term extension; RStudio; BACKLOG","This work presents the status, in Brazil, of pharmaceutical patents granted by US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and their role on the Brazilian Pharmaceutical market. Data show that 27.1% of the US-granted patents filed in Brazil are granted by Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (INPI) and 76.5% of them have their term extended due to provision of article 40 of the Brazilian Industrial Property Law (LPI 9279/96), while 65% of these US-patents are not valid in Brazil, evidencing market openness and independence of patent examination of INPI before USPTO. The effects of INPI backlog of patent examination on pharmaceutical market are also highlighted. These aspects are relevant to stablish better strategies to reduce backlog and to orient public policies to stimulate the Brazilian industry, especially with respect to the production of generic and similar drugs.",2020,Information Science & Library Science,1

Does Strengthening the Property Rights of Employee-Inventors Spur Innovation? Empirical Evidence on Freedom-to-Create Laws Passed by US States,; OWNERSHIP; CONTRACTS; ECONOMICS; PATENTS; GROWTH; COSTS,"The incompleteness of employment contracts may leave inventors vulnerable to ex post opportunism by their employers, which could curtail their innovative effort. We use passage of freedom-to-create laws by seven US states as a natural experiment to investigate whether laws strengthening the property rights of inventors against employers' opportunism can foster innovation. We employ a difference-in-differences design that includes a rich set of state, technology, and time fixed effects to compare the quantity and quality of patenting in these seven states vis-a-vis synthetic control states. The laws increased both the number of patents (by 14 percent) and their quality (according to various measures, including citations and the extent of pathbreaking innovation). The increase in innovation was broad, observed for both firm-specific and generic innovation and in firms with and without prior patents.",2023,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1

From the abuse of Community (IP) law to the abuse of (intellectual) property rights: time for an EU patent misuse doctrine?,; COMPETITION; COURT,"center dot In an attempt to draw the boundaries of IP rights (IPRs) within the interface between European competition and patent law, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) devised the concepts of existence-exercise dichotomy and specific subject matter, also articulating the essential function doctrine. Whilst their meaning remains controversial, several CJEU decisions may be of some help to understand which remedies and limits to patent over-enforcement currently exist in case law. center dot In particular, the various IP-driven abuses constitute the core of this article. Patent litigation is seen through the lens of the abuse of Community law doctrine, as well as through the concepts of abuse inferable from CJEU and Member State case law. Thus, the interplay between the abuse of a dominant position and IP malpractice is explored, also looking at some national patent litigation decisions. The ultimate scope is to analyse the legal nature of the different types of abuses of IPRs from the perspectives of competition law, contract law and procedural law. center dot The proliferation of abuses within the IP context undoubtedly leads to uncertainty and fragmentation in remedies in the EU. Thus, this article tries to infer hints towards a uniform solution from the USA. Specifically, three remedies against abuses of IPRs devised at the US level are explored in a comparative fashion to investigate if there is room under IP law or equitable principles for a unitary doctrinal framework of defences against infringement.",2023,Government & Law,1
Clean and sustainable technology innovation,; ,"Has patent law provided adequate incentives for environmental innovation? This Article provides a narrative review that describes (1) clean and sustainable technological inventions and (2) various environmental innovation approaches involving patents in some form and incentivizing technological development and diffusion. Clean, sustainable, or green inventions that lower pollution, use resources in a more sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products, or provide significant energy efficiency have garnered an incredible amount of attention. Scholars and other commentators have analysed the role of patents in facilitating technological development to mitigate climate change, including eco-patent commons, a fast track program, a patent rewards system, and a collaborative and cooperative platform. An analysis of the literature shows that patent law offers certain, though perhaps underutilized, opportunities to promote technological innovation that has environmental benefits.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

Universities as Engines of Development,intellectual property; university; commercialization; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,"The Bayh-Dole Act was enacted in the United States in 1980 to promote economic development and growth at regional and national levels. A key engine is research generated within universities. This article addresses the question of how universities can serve as engines of development. Drawing on Cooter and Shaeffer's work on law and development, specifically what they call the double trust problem, this article shows how the Bayh-Dole Act was justified as resolving the double trust problem arising from lack of property rights in university research. This article presents the argument that this goal of the Bayh-Dole Act ignores how universities solve another dimension of the double trust problem, namely the generation of human capital.

Regulating Generic Ophthalmologic Drug Bioequivalence-Envisioning Accessibility for Patients,generic drugs; Food and Drug Administration; drug access; regulation; bioequivalence; IN-VITRO,"New, brand-name, ophthalmology drug products are developed, investigated, and submitted for marketing approval through premarket interactions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These drug applications for novel drugs are reviewed by FDA for safety and effectiveness before being allowed on the market. Many brand-name drugs are allowed a period of marketing exclusivity and/or have patent protections that can delay generic competition. When these exclusivity periods or patents expire or are challenged (in the case of patents), generic competitors may then market equivalent products, as allowed by U.S. law (eg, Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, often referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act). To be approved as a therapeutic equivalent, a generic product must demonstrate that it is both pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent to the brand-name drug product, which can involve innovative analytical methods and study designs. To facilitate generic drug assessment and approval, the FDA has negotiated the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) program that funds a rigorous generic drug development program that includes pre-Abbreviated New Drug Application (pre-ANDA) correspondence and meetings, targeted bioequivalence research, and publication of product-specific guidances (PSGs) to support generic drug research and development for manufacturers interested in developing generic drugs for the U.S. market.

Proportionality of Trade Secret Remedies in European Union - In Comparison with Patent Law Enforcement,Trade secrets; Patents; Remedies; Proportionality; Fundamental rights; Public interest; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COMPETITION,"In academic discourse it has been pointed out that many European courts do not pay sufficient attention to assessing the proportionality of patent law remedies. Article 3 of the Enforcement Directive (IPRED), which harmonizes the remedies for all intellectual property rights (IPRs), requires that remedies be proportionate. However, it seems that this requirement is often overlooked, with more attention being paid to the rest of Art. 3, namely the requirements that remedies be efficient and dissuasive. This article contributes to the discussion on the potential over-enforcement of IPRs, but focuses in particular on analyzing the remedies available under the Trade Secret Directive (TSD). Special attention will be paid to the explicit proportionality factors under the TSD. The availability of the bona fide defense under the TSD will also be analyzed. In this article, comparisons will be made between remedies under patent law and those under trade secret law. This article argues that the trade secret regime differs from the patent regime. Therefore, balancing the various interests under the TSD proportionality factors and the bona fide defense is more important under the trade secret regime than under the patent regime. This article seeks both to identify the differences between the two regimes and to dissect possibilities for a more balanced approach to enforcement practices under the IPRED for patent rights.",2022,Government & Law,1
Why are they hiding? Patent secrecy and patenting strategies,Patent strategy; pre-grant publication; patent secrecy; INVENTORS PROTECTION ACT; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; MARKET; KNOWLEDGE; ACQUISITION; OPPOSITION; DISCLOSURE; FRAMEWORK,"Patents provide a mechanism to protect inventors from having their inventions imitated by competitors in exchange for a detailed disclosure of the patented invention. However, the disclosure requirement might enable any interested and skilled audiences to understand and replicate the knowledge conveyed by the patent document. The enactment of the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA) on 29 November 2000 required US patent applicants to have their patent application published 18 months after the filing date. The AIPA allows patentees to choose the option of keeping their application secret, relinquishing foreign patent protection. This paper investigates what variables are associated with the decisions made by large companies to keep a patent secret until its granting, using a sample of granted patents applied for by publicly traded companies between 2000 and 2009. In particular, we study the effect of technological crowdedness, strategic use of in-house knowledge stock and invention radicalness on the option for the publication of pre-grant patent applications. The variables relate the reason to opt-out of patent application publication to industry characteristics (competition), firm's characteristics (internal knowledge) and innovation characteristics (radicalness). Results show a negative association between technological crowdedness and pre-grant secrecy, as well as between secrecy and the use of in-house knowledge stock. Conversely, radicalness is positively associated with the likelihood of a patent application being secret until its granting.",2020,Business & Economics,1
A Machete for the Patent Thicket: Using Noerr-Pennington Doctrine's Sham Exception to Challenge Abusive Patent Tactics by Pharmaceutical Companies,; BAD; US,"Outrageous drug prices have dominated news coverage of the American healthcare system for years. Yet despite widespread condemnation of skyrocketing drug prices, nothing seems to change. Pharmaceutical companies can raise drug prices with impunity because they hold patents on their drugs, which give them monopolies. These monopolies are only supposed to last twenty years, and then competing lower-cost drugs like generics can enter the market, driving down the costs of pharmaceuticals for all. But pharmaceutical companies have created patent thickets, dense webs of overlapping patents surrounding one drug, which have artificially extended the companies' monopolies for years or even decades after a drug's initial patent expires. These problems will only be exacerbated as the pharmaceutical industry increasingly focuses on biologic drugs, which already provide more opportunities to acquire multiple patents on one drug than traditional small-molecule drugs. Patent law's weapons in the fight against patent thickets, namely litigation and inter partes reviews (an abbreviated process for challenging patent validity), have proven to be inadequate a scalpel when the public needs a machete. Antitrust law, which polices anticompetitive behavior and corrects market failures, is the ideal weapon to fight the pharmaceutical industry's exploitation of patent law. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which immunizes parties from antitrust liability when a party petitions the government, currently stands in the way of an antitrust solution to the patent-thicket problem. Petitions eligible for Noerr-Pennington antitrust immunity include patent applications and patent-infringement lawsuits, so the pharmaceutical industry can wield the Noerr-Pennington doctrine as a sword against potential antitrust challenges. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine has a narrow sham exception, where Noerr-Pennington antitrust immunity is pierced when a party's petitions are mere shams to interfere with the operations of a competitor. Unfortunately, after two Supreme Court decisions about the sham exception, the circuit courts have disagreed on the sham exception's operation, leaving potential antitrust plaintiffs, such as consumers and government regulators, with uncertain prospects for challenging patent thickets under antitrust law. This Note proposes that courts adopt an approach to reconcile the Supreme Court decisions wherein courts apply a stricter standard for invoking the sham exception when an antitrust plaintiff challenges a single sham petition and a looser standard when an antitrust plaintiff challenges a pattern of sham petitions. Further, this Note proposes a general framework for analyzing patent proceedings under the looser pattern standard. This solution strikes a balance between protecting parties' First Amendment petitioning right and discouraging abuse of the patent law system for anticompetitive effect. If successful, antitrust challenges can lead to quicker market entry for lower-cost drugs and allow more people to benefit from innovative and life-altering drugs.",2022,Government & Law,1

The studies show that the mentioned assessments are easier in US compared to European countries for in those countries the precision and solidarity in practicing the inventive step requirement is more compared to US. In Iran, contrary to the mentioned cases, the assessment is not done in the Patent Office by the experts but rather by the verification the office conducts from the Universities and Science and Technology Parks of the country wherein, due to lack of knowledge about the Patent Law, the assessment is not done precisely; an issue which can accentuate the outlook appertaining to oneness of innovation and inventive step in the process of assessment.

We obtain causal estimates by comparing US patents subject to AIPA with twin European patents that were not. Post-AIPA, US patents receive more and faster follow-on citations, indicating greater technology diffusion. Technological overlap increases between distant but related patents and decreases between highly similar patents, and patent applications are less likely to be abandoned, suggesting less duplicative R & D.

ADouble-Edged-Sword Approach to Fighting Pandemics: Patent Waivers and Incentives to Innovate,pandemic; innovation; incentives; patent waivers; intellectual property; TREATY,"Although continents recently experienced an apocalyptic pandemic that posed a mortal danger to millions of people, a new, even deadlier pandemic could soon emerge... The paper seeks to address the role played by patent waivers and current contractual arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry in addressing the dangers caused by the current and future pandemics. The process of waiving patents is explored where it is argued that it sadly cannot amount to the knight in shining armour that everyone has been expecting. Due to the lack of coordination, the tremendously long process, and the potential block in innovation arising from pharmaceutical companies having smaller incentives, more attention must be paid to other alternative institutional solutions. Drawing from the economics literature on innovation in the pharmaceutical sector, a conceptual framework is proposed for improved legal intervention in the case of patent waivers in international intellectual property law instruments.

"Global equitable access to vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for COVID-19: The role of patents as private governance",right to healthcare; decision-making; distributive justice; law; ,"In June 2020, Gilead agreed to provide the USA with 500 000 doses of remdesivir-an antiviral drug which at that time was percieved to show promise in reducing the recovery time for patients with COVID-19. This quantity represented Gilead's then full production capacity for July and 90% of its capacity for August and September. Similar deals are evident around access to proposed vaccines for COVID-19, and such deals are only likely to increase. These attempts to secure preferential access to medicines and vaccines, so-called vaccine/treatment nationalism, jeopardise supplies of life-saving treatments and vaccines available elsewhere, and jeopardise global equitable distribution of such vaccines/treatments more generally. Much of the focus to date has been on States' role in negotiating such deals. However, such developments also demonstrate the power patent holders have in controlling access to life-saving healthcare, determining who obtains access first and at what price. This article argues that the extent of control currently given to patent holders for COVID-19 must be questioned. This article demonstrates that patents have significant implications for healthcare acting as private governance tools over patented inventions. It is only by greater probing of patent holders' role in delivering access to medicines, diagnostics and vaccines for COVID-19 that equitable global equitable access can be achieved.",2021,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences,1
Communities as inventors: Rethinking positive protection of traditional knowledge through patents,international economic law; moral rights; patents; traditional knowledge; TRIPS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; RIGHTS,"Traditional knowledge of indigenous communities often overlaps with spiritual traditions in which certain biogenetic resources are understood to be sacred. Accordingly, one of the key concerns of these communities is to retain control over the manner in which the knowledge is used so as to ensure that its sanctity is preserved. While much of the literature on the protection of traditional knowledge revolves around defensive protection, some commentators have argued for positive protection using patent law by recognizing the entire community as inventors and vesting property rights in perpetuity with the community as a whole. This paper observes that such positive protection through patents is consistent with the TRIPS Agreement and is likely to be successful in combating biopiracy but suffers from one crucial flaw-even if the community owns patent rights over a biogenetic resource, the community has no means to ensure that a potential licensee of the patent would adhere to the religious protocols of the community. Accordingly, it argues for the incorporation of collective moral rights rooted in indigenous law into the legal framework governing the licensing of traditional knowledge patent with a view to ensuring that indigenous communities can preserve their cultural heritage even after such community patents are licensed.",2023,Government & Law,1

On November 29, 2000, the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA) reduced the default publication time of patents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to 18 months. We analyze the effects of this change by means of a regression discontinuity design with time as an assignment variable and a complementary difference-in-differences analysis. Our study shows that information flows from patents measured by forward citations, increased. Interestingly, the degree of localization within geographic boundaries remained unchanged and technological localization even increased moderately. Moreover, the effect of early disclosure on citations from patents filed by patent attorney service firms is particularly strong. These results imply that knowledge diffusion stemming from speedier disclosure of technical information is confined to the existing attention scope and absorptive capacity of inventors and organizations.",2020,Business & Economics,1

With this comes the reinforcement of debates between the right to health and pharmaceutical patent rights. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how the Philippines could attempt to balance the right to health with pharmaceutical patent rights in the introduction of a potential COVID-19 vaccine into the country. Design/methodology/approach This will be accomplished through an examination of the flexibilities allowed by international agreements and domestic patent laws. Findings With the economic and health challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine Government will have a strong justification to pursue parallel importation and compulsory licencing under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. This is exacerbated by the bold leadership of President Duterte, whose administration has so far shown a propensity to decide in favor of the right to health at the expense of other rights in dealing with the pandemic. Originality/value While this paper focuses on the Philippines, it has a potential application in the least developed and developing countries which aim to gain access to a prospective COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, while this study discusses the harmonization of laws on the right to health and patent laws as a solution to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of access to vaccines, it also calls for solutions that go beyond the application of the law.",2021,Health Care Sciences & Services,1
RETHINKING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COMMON LAW,; OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE; LONG-TERM; PATENT-LAW; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; ANTITRUST POLICY; PATH DEPENDENCE; CHICAGO SCHOOL; MARKET POWER; SHERMAN ACT; INNOVATION,"This Article shows how Posner and other scholars who claimed that common law was efficient misunderstood the structure of common law. If common law was more efficient, there would have been a noticeable push across most, if not all, doctrines to greater efficiency. This has not been the case. Rather, common law, better recast as a platform, could, under a certain set of parameters, lead to efficient outcomes. Next, the Article's analysis suggests that while not every judge thinks about efficiency in decisionmaking there must be some architectural or governance feature pushing in the direction of efficiency-which exists in some areas of law and not in others. This Article explains two-sided markets, or platforms, generally and applies the modular open-source platform model to judge made law. In doing so, it explores concepts that impact the efficiency of such platforms-platform governance, modularity, and fragmentation. Then, this Article applies the understanding of platforms to several areas of law that might be understood as more prone to economic analysis because the issues addressed in law tend to be more economic, such as torts, bankruptcy, patents, and corporations. In these areas, no combination of platform architecture and modularity has allowed for the development of more efficient legal rules as a general matter. Finally, this Article studies antitrust law as the one area of law that suggests that the efficiency of common law is possible and the causal mechanism of necessary conditions that needs to be met. Antitrust law is different than other areas of law because of a singular goal, an architectural governance based on a single federal court (the Supreme Court) with few substantive legislative changes for the past one hundred years, which provides for coherent governance of the platform. This Article concludes by discussing the implications of an efficient platform design for other areas of law.",2020,Government & Law,1
Japanese biotechnology regulation and life science (gene) patenting,Japanese biotechnology regulation; Japanese gene patenting system; life science and law; ANTICOMMONS,"Japanese patenting system on biotechnological inventions is unique. In 1979, before the US Supreme court's decision in the Chakrabarti case (1980), the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) had issued the Implementing Guidelines for the Invention of Microorganisms, and microorganism was considered as patentable. Japan lacks case laws. However, we can find cases like the Engineered Mice case. This study paper critically surveys and focuses on the Japanese life science (Gene/DNA) patenting system and its prevailing issues. This paper critically analyzes the current position and practices of the JPO on DNA patenting, including induced pluripotent stem cells as well as CRISPR gene-editing technique, its challenges, and its potential future courses on this issue; the basis of granting a patent for DNA in Japan; Japanese outlook at ethical (living organisms) aspects of DNA patenting; depository system in Japan; the impacts of the tragedy of anticommons in Japan; Creative Commons movement; and others.",2021,Government & Law,1
Why 50?: 'industrial application' limitation in the Indian copyright-design interface,; ,"The current IP overlap in Indian copyright and design laws maintains that fine art aesthetics remain a province of copyright law and are strictly disjointed from protection afforded to utilitarian objects under design law. In practical application, however, Section 15 of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 serves as a point of partial cumulation. Section 15(2) creates a curious situation where the nature of the work could be determined not by its substantive subject-matter requirement but rather an arbitrary rule of more-than-50 articles of production. Section 15 remains an unrefined relic of the Imperial Copyright Act of 1914. The strong reactions against the repeal of Section 52 of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988 along with varied applications of the 50-article rule in other common law jurisdictions can be useful for the Delhi High Court in considering the ongoing constitutional challenge against Section 15(2). Differences in judicial opinions in a rather small pool of precedents have created significant scepticism in interpreting the precise scope of this 'industrial application' limitation. Repealing Section 15(2), despite its controversial status, would move the Indian copyright-design interface from partial to full cumulation-a result that does not sit well with the present legislative structure. Resolution of the issue requires the court to display sound conceptual deftness.",2024,Government & Law,1

Prior to ratification, compulsory licensing was eliminated from Canada's Patent Act and intellectual property rights (IPRs) were strengthened. Compulsory licensing allows competitors to produce drugs under patent without the consent of the patent holder, challenging drug monopolies and lowering prices, whereas IPRs lengthen patent protections, shielding patent holders from competition and increasing prices. We perform a critical discourse analysis of key provisions in Chapter 17 of NAFTA in light of industry claims that pharmaceutical innovation requires important investments in research and development, justifying high drug prices. We note that since NAFTA, spending in research and development in Canada has decreased and drug prices have increased, becoming a major barrier to equitable access to critically necessary medications. We argue that by modifying the law, the federal government has wronged the Canadian people by discursively appropriating the language of protecting the public good while in practice legitimizing and consolidating private drug development and production, legalizing exorbitant profits, and excluding well-tested publicly financed alternatives. While NAFTA has now been superseded by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, our analysis offers important lessons moving forward.",2020,Health Care Sciences & Services,1
When speed matters: a discussion on the benefits of a grace period in patent law to accelerate pharmaceutical innovation in times of pandemic,drug discovery; grace period; invention disclosure; novelty; open innovation; patent law harmonization; ,"The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a solemn reminder of the need to accelerate pharmaceutical innovation. The desire for fast access to vaccines triggered discussion of unrestricted access to research findings with the hope of facilitating the drug discovery process to combat COVID-19. Increasingly, abolition of the patent system is being discussed in connection with the fight against the pandemic. This may accelerate discovery of and increase access to medicines. However, society's desire for immediate disclosure of research findings conflicts with the inventor's legitimate interest to protect his or her invention as well as the need to recover investments made to develop the drug. The call for immediate disclosure of research results contradicts the interest of the inventor, whose primary goal is to secure his intellectual property rights, usually by applying for patent protection. In Europe, where patent law is based on the principle of absolute novelty, disclosure of the results reduces novelty and prevents subsequent patenting. Consequently, patenting remains the top priority for pharmaceutical companies in Europe, while disclosure of the results is secondary. The following article looks critically at the idea of using the grace period in European patent law to reconcile the conflicting interests of society and inventors in times of pandemic. In this paper, we investigate whether the implementation of a grace period in European patent law like that known in the USA, Japan, or Korea benefits the disclosure of results and increases the flow of information, ultimately leading to the promotion of innovation and rapid drug discovery. This article questions whether the use of a grace period provides a sufficient incentive to the inventor for rapid disclosure.",2022,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,1
The Hitchhiker's Guide to Outer Space Patents,outer space; patents; space commercialization; extra -terrestrial jurisdiction; ,"Investment in space technologies has predominantly been a prerogative of the public sector. Now increasing privatization and commercialization of space markets is creating opportunities to develop new space applications. The potential to commercially leverage intellectual property is a motivating factor behind this private financing and plays a key role in helping private companies secure returns on investment. International space law treaties remain silent on the notion of intellectual property and intellectual property treaties lay heavy emphasis on territorial application of patent law, thereby creating a theoretical disconnect. Legal machinery drafted for activities on starting points in bridging the gap between patents and space law by advancing the concept of quasi-territoriality. However, in doing so, they expose the space-patent market to possibilities of forum shopping, flags of convenience and race to the bottom scenarios.

The Ghost in the Patent System: An Empirical Study of Patent Law's Elusive Skilled Artisan,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT,"Patent law shares with tort law the presence of an artificial character that structures judicial decision-making. Much like the reasonable person in tort law, the person having ordinary skill in the art (or PHOSITA) frames judicial inquiries into such central patent law questions as whether an invention is obvious, set out in sufficient detail, or infringed by a competitor. The PHOSITA's perspective is considered so self-evident and foundational to the field that virtually every patent textbook and judicial opinion emphasizes that doctrinal outcomes are tied to the technical perspective of the PHOSITA, not that of the judge or an ordinary observer. Despite the field's acknowledged reliance on this artificial character, and the Supreme Court's reaffirmation of its importance, scholars and jurists have raised doubts as to whether the PHOSITA in fact plays an outcome-determinative role in the resolution of patent disputes. In this Article, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of the role of the PHOSITA in patent litigation. Through close readings of seven hundred trial and appellate court opinions as well as automated textual analysis of over seven thousand cases, we evaluate the way lower courts create their artificial PHOSITA, the construct's impact on legal decision-making, and the influence of Supreme Court interventions on lower court outcomes. We find that the PHOSITA plays a surprisingly small role in judicial decision-making, even in the aftermath of Supreme Court decisions that emphasize its centrality. Unpacking these results, we show that lower courts lack guidance in how to reconcile competing conceptions of the PHOSITA as a real- world construct tied to specific facts and as a legal construct designed to advance normative goals. We argue for a normative use of the construct and offer a structure for lower court decision-making. By crafting different versions of the PHOSITA tailored to the normative goals of obviousness, claim construction, and infringement that patent law seeks to answer, lower courts can create a PHOSITA that, however artificial, works more effectively to advance the goals of the patent system.",2022,Government & Law,1
Rulemaking S 101,; RULES,"The doctrine of subject-matter eligibility, as developed from 35 U.S.C. S 101, ensures that no one can stifle innovation by gaining a monopoly over an abstract idea, natural phenomenon, or law of nature. By excluding abstract ideas and laws of nature from patent protection, the doctrine ensures that no one can stifle innovation by gaining a monopoly over something as fundamental as the law of gravity. But recent decisions by the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit have muddied the distinction between patentable and unpatentable subject matter. The resulting doctrinal confusion around subject-matter eligibility has prompted innovators to warn of serious consequences to investment and also spurred a notoriously ossified Congress to consider bipartisan reforms. Enter the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Although this office lacks the formal authority to promulgate substantive rules on subject-matter eligibility, it has nonetheless broadened its use of guidance documents in that area as a means of addressing this crisis. This Note chronicles the USPTO's use of these guidance documents across time, as well as how federal courts and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board have come to rely on them. It argues that these guidance documents, for all their regulatory utility, closely resemble legislative rules. Looking ahead, this Note encourages Congress to grant the USPTO rulemaking authority over patentability. Until it does so, the USPTO's recent guidance threatens to push the boundaries of its current authority and run afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act.",2020,Government & Law,1
ANTITRUST LITIGATION OF STRATEGIC PATENT LICENSING,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS; INNOVATION; POLICY,"Antitrust and patent law exist in permanent tension, with patentholders permitted to engage in conduct that would otherwise be plainly anticompetitive. Given the over five hundred billion dollars of annual R&D investment in the United States, and given the importance of R&D for corporations' long-term economic profits, the broad deference given in antitrust law to patentee conduct is shocking. Continuing such deference misunderstands the purpose of antitrust law and undermines the purpose of patent law. This Note focuses on one area where this tension should be resolved in favor of increased antitrust enforcement: strategic patent licensing arrangements whereby a patentee transfers a share of its monopoly profits in order to control its competitor's R&D. Such strategic arrangements can be used in 1) a duopoly where large competitors agree to divide an existing market; and 2) a platform technology where the patent holder encourages inventions that follow on, rather than compete with, an existing patent. This Note argues that anticompetitive strategic patent licensing is currently addressable under existing antitrust doctrine. By defining a market for research and development, regulators can successfully litigate against strategic licensing without needing to extend existing antitrust doctrine. Defining a market for research and development, moreover, connects the academic push for dynamic antitrust analysis into the existing static antitrust framework, allowing courts to gain experience with dynamic analysis in a more comfortable static setting. Lastly, while this Note is broadly theoretical, this is not by choice, but a byproduct of the broad-scale secrecy surrounding patent license agreements. Accordingly, this Note calls for the FTC to use existing statutory authority to begin investigating the real-world anticompetitive uses of strategic patent licensing.",2020,Government & Law,1

Hundreds of thousands of lives have lost and lives of billions more have been spilled. Apart from developing a successful Co-vaccine, the vital challenge is to ensure equitable access by accountability and transparency in vaccine allocation. 'Nobody wins the race until everyone wins' because this global infectious threat knows no boundaries. While 90% successful vaccines are set for the pandemic, patent regimes have to be ready with a well balanced mechanism promoting innovation and ensuring access to COVID 19 treatment. Call for 'patent waver' on COVID 19 was also a miserable failure. Equally alarming is pandemic profiteering by institutions like Vanderbilt University and AstraZeneca. Challenge before the international community is not simply the vaccine development; real threat is vaccine nationalization and patent monopolization. In this context the patent law of the kingdom has a critical role in spurring innovation on COVID 19 treatments and also it in ensuring equitable access of the vaccine to the developing countries.",2021,Government & Law,1
Patent law reform and innovation: An empirical assessment of the last 20 years,Patent; Policy change; Litigation; U.S; LITIGATION; EBAY,"We ask whether four of the most important U.S. patent system reforms of the last 20 years-elimination of presumptive injunctive relief for victorious patent enforcers in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC , 547 U.S. 388 (2006); creation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) in the America Invents Act; restriction of software's eligibility for patent protection in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int 'l , 573 U.S. 208 (2014); and limitation of patent enforcers' choice of forum in TC Heartland, LLC v. Kraft Foods Grp. Brands, LLC , 137 S. Ct. 1514 (2017)-had a measurable impact on innovation in the U.S. Specifically, we use a sample of publicly traded firms to construct firm-level measures of innovation and exposure to each reform and adopt a variety of difference-in-differences approaches that assesses how innovation-related activities changed post-reform at relatively exposed versus relatively unexposed firms. We find: a positive association between eBay and R &D spending by firms that were relatively more exposed to patent litigation prior to the Court's decision; a positive association between the introduction of PTAB proceedings and R &D expenditures by firms that innovate in tech classes where PTAB has been most active; a positive association between Alice and R &D spending by software firms; and a positive association between TC Heartland and R &D spending by firms that thereafter could not be sued in the Eastern District of Texas, a court long associated with opportunistic forum shopping.",2024,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1
UNCLEAN PATENTS,; ,"The doctrine of unclean hands is perhaps the most storied affirmative defense in civil cases. It allows a court to dismiss a lawsuit without reaching the merits if the patent owner (patentee) engaged in misconduct related to the claim being asserted. In patent law, the Supreme Court has stated that the doctrine is of paramount interest given the nature of the patent bargain between the inventor and the public. Nonetheless, unclean hands has been a relatively dormant defense in patent cases, other than in the specific context of patent procurement at the Patent Office (where it has evolved into the doctrine of inequitable conduct). It has also been mostly limited to cases involving litigation misconduct where the dismissal rendered the patent unenforceable against the accused infringer. Recently, however, the defense was successfully asserted against a patentee for prelitigation business misconduct. This holding raised eyebrows because it resurrected the doctrine and applied it more broadly than prior cases. Resurrecting unclean hands in patent law makes sense from a normative perspective. Allowing patentees to take advantage of their own misconduct contravenes the public interest, jeopardizes the legitimacy of the courts, and ultimately undermines the integrity of the patent system. But this insight raises three important normative questions: First, what types of misconduct should trigger the defense? Second, what nexus in time, causation, and logical linkage should exist between the alleged misconduct and the patent-in-suit? And third, does resurrecting the doctrine align with current patent policy and other goals of the patent system? I answer these questions in this Article by offering a new theory of unclean hands in patent law. I argue that misconduct during the acquisition of the patent right (other than at the Patent Office) should render the patent universally unenforceable against any potential defendant-infringer if the defendant-infringer can show a sufficient nexus. After exploring the types of misconduct that would or wouldn't trigger the doctrine, I describe how the proposed approach aligns with normative justifications for unclean hands and broader goals of the patent system. I also offer a set of principles to limit and guide a court's discretion in applying the doctrine in patent suits.",2022,Government & Law,1

This article concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a serious threat to the public health of various countries which has justified the use of compulsory licensing to exploit new patents.

Navigating the new approach and evolving theory: a study of injunctive relief for SEPs in China,Intellectual property; standard-essential patents; injunctive relief; FRAND; RULES; LAW,"Civil law indicates that an injunction shall be granted once property rights and personal rights are found to have been violated. In China, intellectual property judicial practice has adhered to this rule, resulting in an initial approach to patent injunctions known as 'injunctive relief as a matter of course'. However, with a deeper understanding of corrective justice in law and economics theory, the automatic application of injunction for patents has been restricted. Conversely, in disputes over standard essential patents (SEPs), China has shifted its approach to injunctive relief from de facto exclusion to conditional application. Although the approaches to ordinary patents and SEPs have diverged, the underlying theoretical support, i.e. the balance of interest principle and the proportionality principle, remains consistent. An analysis reveals that the balance of interest principle provides guidance in the settlement of SEP disputes, while the proportionality principle serves as an effective tool for implementation.",2024,Government & Law,1

UNREGISTERED PATENTS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; EX ANTE; COPYRIGHT; INFORMATION; MARKET; POST; ANTICOMMONS; INNOVATION; SCIENCE,"Although all should be treated equally under the law, patent law has long been known to favor some less than others. Patentable technology is highly heterogeneous, covering everything from minute improvements in electronics to pioneering new artificial organs, but patent protection itself is purely a one-size-fits-all system. Patents thus overreward some while underrewarding others. On the one hand, patents overreward low-investment, low-value inventions by granting them the same twenty-year term of protection as those that required much higher investments and yield much higher social value. The resulting glut of low-quality patents has contributed greatly to the patent crisis of opportunistic patent trolls, heightened transaction costs, and costly litigation that have ultimately stalled innovation. On the other hand, patents also underreward in two significant ways. First, patents often fail to give some high-investment, high-value inventions enough protection. Second, many inventors are shut out from patent protection altogether if they lack the resources necessary to navigate the patent system's costly, complex, and frequently biased examination process. This latter phenomenon disproportionately affects female and minority inventors, among others, thereby creating significant distributive effects. This Article argues that both of these effects-the overprotection of low-value inventions and the underprotection of inventions by women and minorities-could be alleviated by altering one particular but seldom-appreciated aspect of the patent system's one-size-fits-all approach: its registration-only design. Copyright and trademark law allow for both registered and unregistered rights, but the patent system grants rights only to those who register their inventions and undergo subsequent examination. If the patent system were to follow the two-tiered approach of copyright and trademark law, however, and implement a regime of automatic but very limited unregistered rights in addition to registered rights, it could help address both problems. First, providing a much lower-cost alternative for obtaining protection, such a two-tiered regime could, with varying degrees of aggressiveness, channel low-investment, low-value inventions away from the system-clogging overprotections of the full, twenty-year, broad rights currently granted to registered patents. Second, as the authors of this Article have previously argued, by providing automatic rights without having to go through the resource-intensive registration and examination process, unregistered patent protection could help women and other disadvantaged inventors gain greater access to patent protections. Maintaining a two-tiered regime of both registered and unregistered patent rights thus offers a promising way to mitigate the inefficiencies of the current system by attenuating certain aspects of the current patent crisis while promoting a more egalitarian playing field for inventors.",2020,Government & Law,1

Optimising Intellectual Property in the Age of AI Creativity: Perspectives from the United States,; ,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a subject of, and contributor to, innovation across industries. These AI-related inventions raise important intellectual property (IP) law issues, most notably under copyright and patent law. Copyright law must grapple with the issue of AI as author and patent law faces the issue of AI as inventor. AI also raises novel challenges for patent law's subject matter eligibility, non-obviousness and disclosure requirements. Additionally, AI implementers and other data owners should consider how IP can protect data - the fundamental ingredient of all AI systems. As AI continues to rapidly transform every industry and field of innovation, AI implementers and data owners should take proactive steps to stay ahead of the curve in adapting to corresponding changes in available IP protection for their AI and data assets.

HARD TRUTHS ABOUT SOFT IP,; ,"People routinely refer to copyright and trademark as soft IP to distinguish these practices from another area of intellectual property: patent. But the term reflects implicit biases against copyright and trademark doctrine and practitioners. Soft IP implies that patent law alone is hard, even though patents are no more physically, metaphorically, or intellectually hard than copyrights and trademarks. Despite stereotypes to the contrary, patents are not necessarily more practically hard: While the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office requires technical training for select patent prosecutors, which excludes many women and people of color, no such experience is necessary for most patent litigators or advisers. So what's so soft about soft IP? Simple: Women are more likely to be practitioners, partners, and professors within copyright and trademark law, and softness has been associated with women for centuries. Softness is resilient, flexible, and supportive, but soft IP is rarely invoked to celebrate these connotations. Instead, the term implies, intentionally or not, that people who practice copyright and trademark law are less capable of hard work than patent practitioners. Given the oppression faced by women and people of color in legal practice, little could be further from the truth. This Piece traces problems with presenting patents as hard, as well as the shortcomings of sidelining copyrights and trademarks as soft. It concludes that the term soft IP must be retired and replaced. Sometimes, the right decision is specificity. But there is another alternative.

The race for vaccines has raised important intellectual property rights issues. These are evident in the need to advance the public interest and in the obligation of governments to address the challenge of access to vaccines, especially in sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria with relatively underdeveloped healthcare and innovation ecosystems. While the Nigerian Patents and Designs Act (PDA) establishes a compulsory licence regime that affords access to patented drugs, existing public healthcare is severely challenged in providing access to new medicines.

It recommends the implementation of a government use provision under the PDA, with a view to addressing the challenge of access to COVID-19 vaccines.",2021,Government & Law,1
Patent Inconsistency,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; US PATENT; EMPIRICAL-ASSESSMENT; SYSTEM; INFRINGEMENT; HOLDUP; POLICY; JURIES; LAW,"Despite the promise of efficiency through the use of expert agency adjudication in U.S. patent law, administrative substitution continues to fall short. In a variety of ways, the decade-old system of Patent Office adjudication is simply an additional place to litigate rather than the robust technocratic alternative it was meant to be. These problems have arisen from important defects in the statutory design, but also from the enormous expansion and ascendancy of the Patent Office itself. Moreover, while duplicative litigation over patent validity is recognized and criticized, its scale and scope has eluded detailed empirical analysis until now. This Article documents and measures those ill effects and explains their structural origins. It evaluates varying responses from Federal Circuit and Supreme Court decisions and from regulatory experimentation in the Patent Office itself. The Article concludes with proposals for reform. The analytical framework for reform that is suggested here is especially timely given the incompleteness of judicial and regulatory responses thus far.",2022,Government & Law,1
The Library of Babel for Prior Art: Using Artificial Intelligence to Mass Produce Prior Art in Patent Law,; DISCLOSURE,"Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in the invention and innovation processes of our society. To date, though, much of the academic discussion on the interaction of artificial intelligence and the patent system focuses on the patentability of inventions produced by artificial intelligence. Little attention has been paid to organizations that are seeking to use artificial intelligence to defeat the patentability of otherwise patent-worthy inventions by mass producing prior art. This Note seeks to highlight the consequences of allowing mass-produced, AI-generated prior art to render valuable inventions unpatentable. Specifically, this Note concludes that AI-generated prior art decreases the incentive for researchers to disclose valuable knowledge through the patent system without providing an adequate substitute source of such knowledge. This Note also examines a number of patent law doctrines that should, but likely will not, prevent deficient AI-generated prior art from rendering valuable inventions unpatentable. To resolve these issues, this Note proposes a solution that modifies the current novelty inquiry and breathes new life into the patent law doctrine of conception. This solution advances the patent system's purpose of promoting technological advancement while still allowing artificial intelligence to play a large role in that technological advancement.",2021,Government & Law,1

However, existing approaches rely on book laws while most variance across countries emerges from enforcement. We address this weakness and present the Patent Enforcement Index which tracks differences in patent enforcement for 51 countries between 1998 and 2017. We utilize novel firm-level enforcement data and extend the conceptual framework of the patent systems strength index provided by Papageorgiadis a al. (2014).

DO PATENTS DRIVE INVESTMENT IN SOFTWARE?,; LEGAL PROTECTION; INNOVATION; DESIGNS; TROLLS; START,"the wake of a quartet of Supreme Court decisions which disrupted decades of settled law, the doctrine of patentable subject matter is in turmoil. Scholars, commentators, and jurists continue to disagree sharply over which kinds of invention should be patentable. In this debate, no technology has been more controversial than software. Advocates of software patents contend that denying protection would stymie innovation in a vital industry; skeptics argue that patents are a poor fit for software, and that the social costs of patents outweigh any plausible benefits. At the core of this disagreement is a basic problem: the debate is predicated on various claims about how and whether patents incentivize innovation, but like much of patent law, these claims rest on meager empirical foundations. This Article bolsters these foundations by testing one important claim: that patents serve to attract investment in new inventions. Using a novel quasi -experimental approach and an original dataset, I investigate whether the grant of a patent makes a business -methods software startup more likely to attract early -stage venture capital investment. In contrast to prior scholarship, I find no evidence that patents play a role in channeling investment to these startups, nor that they lead to more successful downstream outcomes such as acquisitions and initial public offerings. These findings have important implications for both patent policy and scholarship. First, this Article provides new evidence on the perennial controversy over whether business -methods software should be patenteligible. As Congress continues to contemplate new legislation to clarify the law of patentable subject matter, the results call into question a leading justification for granting patents in this area. Second, in light of previous scholarship which finds a relationship between patents and investment in other areas of technology, I demonstrate the importance of developing industry -specific evidence on the role that patents play in stimulating innovation.",2024,Government & Law,1
Patent disclosure and venture financing: The impact of the American Inventor's Protection Act on corporate venture capital investments,American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA); corporate venture capital (CVC); disclosure; patent; startup; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; IDEAS; BIOTECHNOLOGY; INVESTORS; ALLIANCE; NETWORKS; SHARKS; MARKET,"Research Summary We investigate the effects of patent disclosure on corporate venture capital (CVC) investments in technology startups. Toward this end, we focus on the passage of the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA), which mandated public disclosure of patent applications. Theoretically, technology disclosure enables CVCs to better evaluate startups and thus, could increase the likelihood of investment relations. Conversely, such disclosure may already satisfy the technology-acquisition objectives of CVCs, reducing CVCs willingness to form an investment relation after disclosure. Our empirical analysis finds that patent disclosure through AIPA increased the likelihood of receiving CVC investments for startups-specifically in industries where patents have higher information significance. We provide evidence that the observed pattern is mainly driven by a reduction of information constraints regarding startups with patent applications. Managerial Summary Receiving corporate venture capital (CVC) funding is an important success factor for technology startups. Would disclosure of a startup's innovation increase or decrease its chance of receiving CVC funding? On the one hand, disclosure by startups would reduce uncertainty and search costs for CVC investors, which could increase the chance of CVC funding. On the other hand, such a disclosure would reveal the startups' technology to the corporations, which would in turn reduce corporate incentive to use funding as awindow to the startup's technology. Thus, disclosure could also reduce the chance of CVC funding of startups. In this paper, we study the above issue by examining the case of the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA), which mandated public disclosure of patent applications. Our results suggest that innovation disclosure significantly improves the likelihood of CVC funding of startups.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Historical Kinship & Categorical Mischief: The Use and Misuse of Doctrinal Borrowing in Intellectual Property Law,; ,"Analogies are ubiquitous in legal reasoning, and, in copyright jurisprudence, courts frequently turn to patent law for guidance. From introducing doctrines meant to regulate online intermediaries to evaluating the constitutionality of resurrecting copyrights to works from the public domain, judges turn to patent law analogies to lend ballast to their decisions. At other times, however, patent analogies with copyright law are quickly discarded and differences between the two regimes highlighted. Why? In examining the transplantation of doctrinal frameworks from one intellectual property field to another, this Article assesses the circumstances in which courts engage in doctrinal borrowing, discerns their rationale for doing so, identifies whether certain patterns of borrowing exist, and scrutinizes the value, propriety, and impact of such borrowing. By tracing the different strains that animate the courts' analogical jurisprudence in patent and copyright law, the Article builds on broader insights from the scholarship on legal borrowing and offers guidance on how to approach analogies between related legal regimes in a more disciplined fashion. In the end, the Article seeks to provide a better understanding of what juridical techniques courts may deploy to strengthen the efficacy of borrowing-so that importation of legal doctrine can do more good than harm-in intellectual property law and more",2023,Government & Law,1
The blocking and transmission effects of lower level system in patent transaction - evidence from Chinese colleges and universities,; DIFFERENCE,"Conflicts and contradictions within the legal system may affect the effectiveness of law enforcement, but scholars have not conducted sufficient empirical research on the mechanism. Based on three periods of mixed cross-sectional data in 2015 and 2019 when the reform of patent transaction system in colleges and universities, which represents a quasi-natural experiment, has been carried out, this study adopted a difference-in-difference (DID) model to empirically analyze the efficiency of patent transactions. It was found that if the lower level system was not removed or revised in time when the higher level law had been revised, it would have a blocking effect on the implementation of the higher level law and thus make patent transaction less efficient. Furthermore, when the lower level system was revised accordingly, it would have a transmission effect on the implementation of the higher level law, which could promote its implementation. This basic conclusion remains valid after a series of robustness tests and can provide useful lessons for the systemic revision and organizing of laws, as well as the reform of the economic and social systems.",2024,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Defining Trade Secrets in the United States: Past and Present Challenges - A Way Forward?,Trade secrets; Defend Trade Secrets Act; Economic Espionage Act; Uniform Trade Secrets Act; TRIPS Agreement; Know-how; PROTECTION,"When approaching an analysis of a particular area of law, one must initially locate and understand the definition of its core concept. Yet in trade secret law serious obstacles impede the process. Unlike other intellectual property (IP) regimes, such as copyright and patent law, the core concepts of which are subject to unitary definitions governed by international treaties or domestic statutes, the trade secret concept has received no parallel treatment and, until recently in the United States, remained mainly defined under common law. Subtle differences in the way trade secrets were judicially conceived often generated conflicts between courts, opening the door for the application of divergent rules on similar points. This confusing background prompted the individual U.S. jurisdictions to gradually orient towards implementing statutory provisions in defining trade secrets. Despite the fact that U.S. trade secret law has since seen several statutory interventions at state and federal level, the precise meaning and definitional parameters of the concept remain elusive. This paper probes the existing trade secret definitions applicable in the U.S. via analysis of the divergent sources of law that underscored their formulation from the past until the present and identifies the challenges pertinent to their application in practice. Its aim is to analyze and compare these legal sources: first, to determine whether the current definition for the concept of a trade secret is adequate, or whether perhaps the existence of the multi-tier system impedes a party's ability to identify trade secrets in a cross-border context; and second, to investigate whether a unanimously accepted definition under a pre-emptive statute complementary to one under an elaborated internationally binding treaty might remedy this issue.",2023,Government & Law,1
Optimal Incentives for Patent Challenges in the Pharmaceutical Industry,Antitrust; Collusion; Patent challenges; Patent settlements; Pharma; SETTLEMENT,"In this paper, we show that a provision in antitrust law to allow patent settlements with a later market entry of generics than the date that is expected under patent litigation can increase consumer welfare. We introduce a policy parameter for determining the optimal additional period for collusion that would incentivize the challenging of weak patents and maximize consumer welfare. While in principle, later market entry leads to higher profits and lower consumer welfare, this can be more than compensated for if more patents are challenged as a result.",2021,Business & Economics,1

Despite the growing literature on patent litigations, research on the impact of patent litigation on firms' patent strategy is sparse, especially on the impact of foreign patent litigations. Using US patent infringement lawsuits in which Chinese public firms act as defendants, this paper investigates the effect of foreign patent litigation on firms' subsequent patent outputs and patent trajectories. We find that the experience of foreign patent litigation increases the accused firms' subsequent patent filings, and those firms tend to apply exploitative patents instead of exploratory patents. We further find that such promoting impact is more pronounced for firms with a high level of international intensity and firms in the ICT industry. These findings highlight the role of foreign patent litigation in future patent creation, thus enriching the literature on patent litigation and international business. According to the results, firms should take foreign patent litigation as an opportunity to build a strong patent portfolio and improve patent strategies.",2024,Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Patent Protection System for Computer Programs in Indonesia and Its Comparison with Several Countries: What's the Issue?,"Patent; Computer Program; Indonesia; Comparison, and Several Countries; ","This paper attempts to examine patent protection systems for computer programs in several countries. During this time, computer programs were known as objects of copyright protection systems. But in reality, computer programs have become objects of patent protection systems (Article 27 (1) TRIPs Agreement). On this basis, it is interesting to study the history of patent protection systems, patent protection systems for computer programs internationally and their arrangements in Indonesia and some countries. The results show that there are similarities and differences in patent protection systems in Indonesia, Japan, the United States, and China. Factors cause this equation; (1) the basis of international law which is used as the same reference, which refers to Article 27 (1) TRIPS Agreement, in which the four countries are members of the WTO/TRIPs Agreement; (2). National interests of each state related to the importance of patent protection on computer programs, all of which assume that the patent protection system is needed in protecting computer programs produced by the community. Factors cause the difference; (1) ways to formulate laws that are different from the four countries, (2) experiences from these countries, and (3) national interests in implementing patent protection strategies on different computer programs.",2020,Government & Law,1

AI inventors: deference for legal personality without respect for innovation?,; ,"This article provides insights into current developments in relation to artificial intelligence (AI) inventors, discussing recent case law and placing it in the context of legal personality and patent justification theory. Legal personality is the cornerstone of the operation of law and legal systems. Similarly, innovation provides the core justification for intellectual property rights. AI systems have demonstrated the ability to produce novel inventions. Ordinarily, the inventor would be the recipient of patents for their inventions. However, AI systems lack legal personality. Thus, should patent law protect inventions made by inventors lacking legal personality? We analyse three jurisdictions-the UK, the US and Australia-and their respective approaches to AI inventors, to explore the conflict between legal personality questions and innovation. The article argues that legal personality is essential for the grant of patent rights and that refusing the entitlement of AI systems to patents is the correct approach. It further argues that statutory reform would be desirable to focus on ensuring that the end user of AI systems is adequately incentivised to create inventions beneficial to society.",2023,Government & Law,1

If a European patent and an Italian patent have been granted for the same invention, the latter, to the extent that it protects the same invention, ceases to have effect. The validity of the Italian patent will not be reinstated even if the European patent is declared to be invalid. No distinction is made in this regard between an invention patent and a utility model patent. 4.

Research on the Patent System in the Field of Water Resources,Water resources; water-related patents; scarcity; industrialization; ,"The paper analyzes the patent system in the field of water resources to boost the industrialization of water-related patents. Water-related patents are characterized by scarcity and high intelligence, which has become a crucial technology field in fierce competition among the United States, Japan, Europe, South Korea and other countries. Analyzing the International Patent Classification Table, we find that the standards of patent laws guarantee the practicality, novelty and creativity of the water-related patents. Our results show that the application of water-related patents in agriculture, industry and drinking water is growing rapidly, and strengthening of patent protection may further promotes the industrial application. We point out that it is necessary to strengthen the legislation on the research and investment of the water-related patents. Improvement of the patent examination quality, along with perfect enforcement of patent protection, may facilitate the innovation of water-related patents.",2020,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology,1
PATENT FORFEITURE,; EQUITY; RISK; LAW; SUPPLEMENTS; INVENTIONS; VEGETABLES; BRASSICA; STANDARD; CANCER; MISUSE,"Patent law doesn't look kindly on patent owners who engage in wrongdoing involving the patent. The U.S. Supreme Court and lower courts have refused to enforce patents tainted with inequitableness, fraud, or bad faith. This issue typically arises in patent litigation when an accused infringer asserts that the patent should be unenforceable if the patentee engaged in one of four proscribed activities: inequitable conduct (deliberate misrepresentations or omissions of material information from the Patent Office); patent misuse (anticompetitive licensing practices); unclean hands (business or litigation misconduct); or waiver/estoppel (a lack of candor before a standard-setting organization). This seems right-a patentee shouldn't be allowed to benefit from wrongdoing.However, the use of unenforceability to remedy patentee misconduct is largely understudied and undertheorized in legal scholarship. One reason is doctrinal. Aside from the four proscribed activities, there is no clear-cut remedy for other types of patentee misconduct involving the asserted patent. For instance, should a patent for a nutritional supplement that makes affirmative misstatements about its safety and efficacy be enforceable? How about a patent that plagiarizes someone else's copyrighted work or makes intentionally misleading assertions about the invention's capabilities?This Article seeks to answer these questions and fill the doctrinal and scholarly gap in patent unenforceability remedies. It offers a new, unclean-hands-based theory of unenforceability called patent forfeiture. If a patentee engages in egregious pre-or post-issuance misconduct involving the patent and gains an inequitable benefit from it or harms a third party, the patentee may forfeit the right to enforce the patent until the misconduct has been abandoned and its ill effects dissipate. Patent forfeiture adopts the hallmarks of equity-flexibility, discretion, and individualization-but is sufficiently constrained to align with other policy objectives of the patent system. And while morality, conscience, and good faith may not play a role in obtaining a patent, patent forfeiture reaffirms the importance of these equitable principles in enforcing a patent.",2023,Government & Law,1

Game Analysis of Different Source Disclosure Model for Genetic Resources and Implications for China*,genetic resources; source disclosure; patent law; game theory; mandatory model; volun; tary model; patent applications; regulatory bodies; cost -benefit perspective; INFORMATION,"Inventions that rely on genetic resources are subject to different source disclosure models in the domestic laws of different countries. Different source disclosure models can indirectly affect the quantity and quality of patents issued in a country, thus resulting in different social benefits. Therefore, an analysis of which source disclosure model is applicable to the patent protection of genetic resources is ofgreat importance. The economic approach ofgame theory is used to analyse the game of interests between patent applicants and the patent examination authority. It is found that the patent examination authority is required to introduce source disclosure rules and that the optimal equilibrium for patent applications can be achieved by requiring companies to comply with a voluntary source disclosure model under intense examination pressure. Based on this, the legislative policies of typical resource-rich countries are selected for analysis to verify the validity of the game conclusions. Finally, policy recommendations for source disclosure requirements for genetic resources in China are proposed based on the game conclusions.",2023,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,1

Using the act of prior patent publication as the proxy variable, it empirically examines the antecedents and consequences of firms' choice of strategic patenting for legitimacy in an integrated framework. Based on Chinese industrial enterprises and a patent database, the results suggest that firms with liabilities of newness, smallness, or privateness are more likely to patent strategically for legitimacy. Meanwhile, the interactions of these characteristics positively impact the ratio of firm to patent strategically for legitimacy. Furthermore, the results also suggest that such strategic patents increase the probability of firms obtaining government sponsorships, high-tech certifications, and venture capital investments rather than enhancing their new product sales.

"Patent Term Extension (PTE) Regime in Australia: Amendments and Analysis of Granted, Pending, and Refused PTE Applications",Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods; Federal Court of Australia; Patent Term Extension; Pharmaceutical Substance; Therapeutic Goods Administration; ,"Patents are governed by the Patent Act 1990 in Australia. The adoption of Trade-Related Aspect of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement in 1995, raised the standard patent term from 16 to 20 years in Australia. For pharmaceutical innovators, 20-year term may found to be insufficient to recoup the investment in research and development (R&D), because a substantial time is required for regulatory review process before approval of the pharmaceutical product and thus, start of its actual marketing. To address this concern, the possibility of extension of the patent term beyond 20 years was introduced in Australia in 1998 by amending the Patent Act 1990. This patent term extension provision came into effect on 27 January 1999. No separate or sui generis right came into existence; rather, the duration of the patent was increased by a particular period of time, referred to as 'Patent Term Extension(s)' (PTE) in Australia and United States of America (USA), 'Certificate of Supplementary Protection' (CSP) in Canada, and `Supplementary Protection Certificate' (SPC) in Europe. Since the implementation of PTE regime in Australia, a few changes took effect. This article provides an in-depth evaluation of PTE in Australia and other relevant changes. It also covers comparative analysis of number of PTE applications granted, pending, refused, and withdrawn in Australia. It was found that during these years, about 92% applications were awarded PTEs, 4% were refused and the remaining applications are awaiting decision. About 70% PTE applications cited product patents, while about 31% applications cited combination/composition patents and remaining 8% applications cited method of use patents. About 57% of granted PTEs received an extension of more than 4 years to 5 years. This article also provides analysis of type of patents referred in the PTE applications, the applicants and term of granted PTEs.

The Patent Trap: The Struggle for Competition and Affordability in the Field of Biologic Drugs,; UNITED-STATES; PRICE-COMPETITION; INNOVATION ACT; BIOSIMILARS; INCENTIVES; CHALLENGE; KNOWLEDGE,"The biologic drug market in the U.S. suffers from a dearth of competition. Ten years after the passage of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), competition from biosimilars remains weak, and prices of branded biologics continue to increase at rates that outstrip inflation. This crisis of non-competition has resulted in billions of dollars in lost savings and reduced access to treatment, especially for vulnerable groups. Patent thickets - dense webs of overlapping patents - are one of the main barriers to biosimilar competition. By protecting their products with patent thickets, branded biologic manufacturers are able to deter competition from biosimilars and maintain periods of market exclusivity that far exceed statutory limits. This Note analyzes regulatory gaps in the BPCIA that allow patent thickets to thrive, and recommends both legislative and administrative solutions. Part II assesses the market landscape for biologic drugs in the U.S. and concludes that, of all barriers to biosimilar competition, patent thickets are the most significant. Part III evaluates the BPCIA framework in light of patent thickets and identifies aspects of the statute that allow patent thickets to block biosimilar market entry. Part IV analyzes recent legislative proposals to address the problem of patent thickets, and recommends administrative changes to strike a better balance between innovation and competition in the field of biologics.",2021,Government & Law; Social Issues,1

When it declared the law ratifying the Unitary Patent Court Agreement unconstitutional, it did so because it is a treaty supplementing or being otherwise closely tied to the EU, in other words, a satellite treaty, inter-se agreement, or more generally: an international law agreement furthering European integration outside the EU law framework. This commonly used integration technique is therefore going to be a lot more difficult in future whenever Germany is involved.

Morality: An Important Consideration at the Patent Office,; BIOTECHNOLOGY; UTILITY; MARKET,"Recent developments in biotechnology have opened new avenues not only for research but also for patenting. However, recent United States Supreme Court decisions such as Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics demonstrate the interpretive difficulties these new technologies raise in patent law. Many scholars, for example, have argued that rather than using the product of nature doctrine and focusing on the line between human and natural constructs, the Court in Myriad should have ruled based on the doctrine's policy goal: protecting the basic tools of scientific and technological work. Not doing so has led to doctrinal confusion, decreased patent protection, and increased uncertainty in industry. In addition, recent biotechnological developments also raise increased ethical concerns. These concerns should lead us to reconsider the relationship between patent law and ethics. After reviewing the history of intellectual property protection for biotechnology inventions, this Note considers the policy rationale of promoting useful inventions and proposes implementation of a new procedure for ethical review at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.",2020,Government & Law,1

Technology Protectionism and the Patent System: Evidence from China,; LOGIT; OFFICE,"Governments have strong incentives to allow their inventors to free ride on foreign technologies. They can achieve this result by discriminating against foreigners in the patent system-by refusing to grant foreigners a patent for their inventions. International patent law treaties forbid this practice, which may lower the global innovation incentives and may hurt international trade. Using data on half a million inventions submitted to the Chinese patent office, we find robust evidence of anti-foreign bias in the issuance of patents in 'strategic' technology areas. Foreigners are about fifty per cent more likely to be refused a strategic patent than locals.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Patenting of agriculture biotechnology in Iraq: Widening the gap between the country's development needs and food security,agriculture; biotechnology patents; food security; Iraqi Patent Law 65l1970; Order 81/2004; TRIPs Agreement; ,"In Iraq, plants and biological processes for their production and plant varieties are patentable Under Order (81/2004) in Iraq and later its amendment Law (58/2015). This paper attempts to critically review patent rules related to agricultural biotechnology. It specifically questions the extent to which Iraq's developmental needs were considered when far-reaching plant related patent protection was granted, The motivation for this study lies in its aim to examine the shift to restrictive exclusionary rights over plant genetic resources, and the implications this shift could have on sustainable agriculture and food security in the country, particularly Iraq lacks technological, institutional and financial capacities that can be directed towards the development of the biotechnology industry in the country.",2024,Government & Law,1
Pharmaceutical patent law and policy in Africa: a survey of selected SADC member states,Africa; patent landscape; pharmaceuticals; access to medicines; TRIPS Agreement; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ACCESS; FLEXIBILITIES; AGREEMENT; TRADE,"The paper surveys the intellectual property (IP) laws of seven Southern African Development Community countries to better understand the nature, scope, and depth of their patent laws with particular focus on their utilisation of TRIPS flexibilities to facilitate pharmaceutical access. The selected countries - Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe - represent a mix of both major and modest economies. While the current literature contains widespread assertions on the impact and effect of TRIPS on access to medicines in these countries and less-developed countries in general, this paper finds that the countries lack explicit and workable provisions implementing key TRIPS flexibilities. Hence, available TRIPS flexibilities have not been well utilised and it is often the complicated and unworkable domestic framework - rather than TRIPS - which becomes the stumbling block to pharmaceutical access. Another major finding is that patents may not be a major impediment in the region given that few patents and even fewer pharmaceutical patents are filed. The paper argues that since the surveyed countries are mainly net IP importers with similar developmental contexts and aspirations, the best approach would be to fully take advantage of existing flexibilities and more aggressively leverage policy space to engender access to cheaper medicines.",2023,Government & Law,1
Pricing innovation: The anchoring effect in patent valuation,Patent; Valuation; Anchoring; Value; Novelty; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; CITATIONS; UNCERTAINTY; MECHANISMS; JUDGMENT; BEHAVIOR; QUALITY; DESIGN; BIAS,"Prior literature has long recognized the substantial economic value that patents hold in the market. Yet, we know much less about the valuation process, i.e., how market audiences estimate (or determine) the value of newly granted patents. Building on behavioral economics, we propose the anchoring effect as an important cognitive mechanism, such that a patent's valuation is anchored on the value that preceding patents have secured. Analyzing financial valuation of U.S. patents between 1991 and 2010, we find broad support to the anchoring effect. The effect is more pronounced when focal patents are of lower novelty, when prior anchors are more consistent, and when focal firms have a higher patenting frequency. Furthermore, our extensional analysis suggests that anchoring acts as an important driver for the divergence between patents' economic value and scientific quality, which deserves attention from firms and policy makers.",2024,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,1
Nonobviousness: Before and After,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; EMPIRICAL-ASSESSMENT; COMMERCIAL SUCCESS; OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE; STANDARDS; INVENTION; LAW; PERSPECTIVES; PSYCHOLOGY; PATENTS,"The requirement of nonobviousness, codified in 35 U.S.C. 103, has been called the ultimate condition of patentability because of its crucial function of keeping technically trivial inventions out of the patent system. The obviousness determination must be made based on the state of the invention's field at a particular point in time-in the Patent Act's current version, the date that the patent application was effectively filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). However, in spite of the critical role of time in patent law and the danger that hindsight bias could distort 103 analysis when patentability is evaluated long after the relevant date (as it usually is), the seminal Supreme Court obviousness opinion in Graham v. John Deere said little about temporal considerations. Instead, Graham's lasting contribution was to suggest that the 103 inquiry is to be divided into two stages based on the source of the proffered evidence. The Court said that as an initial matter, the PTO or a court should look to pre-patent publications and other materials in the public domain and determine the differences between those disclosures and the patent claim at issue. Further, should the parties introduce additional evidence that the Court called secondary considerations, such as commercial success of the patented product or failure of others to come up with the claimed invention, decision-makers would need to continue the analysis to determine the relevance and weight of this evidence before making a final judgment on validity. Although courts and commentators disagree vigorously about the relative roles of these two aspects of the nonobviousness calculus, the primary-secondary framework has a central place in the law of 103. This Article shows that Graham's apparent creation of two tiers of obviousness evidence has caused confusion and error, and should be rejected in favor of a different approach that is focused on time. First, the rigid segmenting of the patentability inquiry into two steps, which is seen in some lower-court decisions interpreting Graham, has caused certain evidence to be arbitrarily discounted or bolstered depending on whether it falls into the primary or secondary silo. Second, and more pernicious, these evidentiary tiers have obscured the significance of time for patentability. This Article argues that, instead, the filing date of the patent application as the default dividing line between the pre- and post-invention state of the relevant field provides a more logical fulcrum around which to organize the 103 analysis. Accordingly, obviousness evidence should be classified based on whether it came into existence independently of the patent and generally prior to filing (ex ante) or, instead, whether it appeared in response to the invention or during its further, post-filing, development (ex post). This Article demonstrates that the proposed scheme would pave the way to a more rational approach to 103 by helping decision-makers determine the relevance and weight of various obviousness evidence with greater accuracy.",2021,Government & Law,1

In such a scenario, the patentability of new pharmaceutical inventions seems more and more problematic, given that the computational power of AI increases the likelihood that a new chemical composition is deemed to be obvious. In this article I argue that with the advent of AI-generated inventions both EU and US patent law cannot rely exclusively on the traditional standard of the person having ordinary skill in the art to evaluate the non-obviousness condition of patentability. However, I also maintain that a legislative reform is not necessary. Rather, judges should start to more strongly consider the so-called secondary considerations of non-obviousness that have been intermittently and inconsistently applied both in US and EU case law.",2020,Government & Law,1

We do this by creating a correspondence of all patents within the US patent system to a set of 1757 technology domains. A technology domain is a body of patented inventions achieving the same techno-logical function using the same knowledge and scientific principles. These domains contain 97.2% of all patents within the entire US patent system. From the identified patent sets, we calculated the average centrality of the patents in each domain to predict their improvement rates, following a patent network-based methodology tested in prior work. They vary from a low of 2% per year for the Mechanical Skin treatment-Hair Removal and wrinkles domain to a high of 216% per year for the Dynamic information exchange and support systems integrating multiple channels domain, but more that 80% of technologies improve at less than 25% per year. Fast improving domains are concentrated in a few technological areas. The domains that show improvement rates greater than the predicted rate for integrated chips, from Moore's law, are predominantly based upon software and algorithms. In addition, the rates of improvement were not a strong function of the patent set size.",2021,Business & Economics,1

The process of including patented Risperdal Consta into the Indian formulary has lacked transparency and suggests undo favor towards Janssen. Janssen Pharmaceutica is known for its aggressive marketing strategy resulting in off-label use of oral risperidone in the US. Moreover, the lax regulatory structure for pharmaceutical dispensing in India coupled with Janssen's aggressive marketing is a potential cause of concern.

Leaving aside the practical implications of this judgment in terms of the possibility of obtaining a supplementary protection certificate for a product protected by a patent for a second or further medical application (application patent), it is worth considering the reasoning the Court relies on to arrive at the thesis it formulates. While the Court's response and the resulting impact will be treated differently depending on whether the actual extension of patent protection in the pharmaceutical industry is assessed as appropriate and desirable or whether the justification for said protection is questioned, the manner in which the provisions of Regulation 469/2009 are proposed to be interpreted raises doubts as to whether the final outcome of the interpretation is correct.",2021,Government & Law,1

Patent suspension on the COVID-19 vaccine in Indonesian patent law perspective,patent flexibility clauses; patent suspension; trips agreement; COVID-19 vaccine; WTO,"Vaccination patent is associated with exclusive rights that restrict the production, use, and sale of inventions by third parties for a specific period. This factor contributes to the high cost of vaccines, making it challenging to access vaccines in many underdeveloped nations such as Indonesia. The urgency for faster vaccine distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlights this issue. However, the patent provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) may exacerbate the unequal distribution of vaccines worldwide. This study analyzes the implementation of the flexibility feature of the TRIPs Agreement, and Doha Declaration contained in Law Number 13 of 2016 respecting Patent to achieve a pandemic-free era. It is also necessary to examine the Indonesian patent rules and regulations, the TRIPs Agreement, the Doha Declaration, and other legal documents to examine these issues. The results showed that the patent rules and regulations have adopted flexibility under the TRIPs Agreement and the Doha Declaration. However, the effect on the country's sluggish pharmaceutical supply chain has not been improved. A patent suspension system on a global scale is required to hasten the transition to a pandemic-free period since the feature of flexibility cannot handle the slow pace of vaccine procurement. The patent suspension system can be implemented through international agreements, such as the Patent Suspension Proposal filed by South Africa and India in October 2020. The suspension is crucial to accelerate the equitable distribution of vaccines and reduce their price.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics,1

Strategic Patenting by Pharmaceutical Companies - Should Competition Law Intervene?,Strategic patenting; Evergreening; Pharmaceutical patents; Anticompetitive effect; Generic competition; Access to medicines; Access to COVID-19 treatment; INNOVATION; THICKETS; DRUGS,"As the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of thousands of people worldwide, the problem of timely access to affordable medicines has intensified today. Based on past experience of accessing medicines for life-threatening diseases there is a justifiable fear that access to any vaccines and treatments that are eventually developed may be hindered by patents, leading to unaffordable prices. In particular, one of the reasons that typically leads to high prices is strategic patenting employed by pharmaceutical companies. While this practice is currently considered lawful, this article argues that strategic patenting requires a long-overdue intervention by competition authorities and aims to attract their attention to its harmful effects. It maintains that, along with a more immediate negative effect in the form of high drug prices, strategic patenting affects dynamic competition by stifling innovation of both originators and generic companies. The article outlines the current approach to strategic patenting and provides arguments for the intervention of competition law. This, in turn, will open the possibility for competition authorities to investigate this practice and prevent its harmful effect on drug prices and pharmaceutical innovation, for the benefit of consumer welfare.",2020,Government & Law,1

Specifically, by using game theory tools, it is shown that patents can act as a leniency mechanism, i.e., they can enable firms to leave a cartel without the risk of retaliation. However, the socially beneficial role of patents is limited because Bertrand competition itself breaks the collusion via the existence of a prisoner's dilemma between sufficiently myopic market rivals. In the prisoner's dilemma, two social tensions, fear and greed, make firms deviate from collusion. Patenting breaks the collusion, but at the social cost of a temporary patent monopoly in the product market.",2020,Business & Economics,1
The Gewirthian Needs-Based Hierarchy: A Concept for Prioritising Conflicting Norms in International Law,International law; access to medicines; right to health; legal hierarchy; treaty law; IP; patent rights; TRIPS; RIGHTS; DIGNITY; ACCESS,"International law is divided into functionally detached treaty regimes which lack clear hierarchies between them. Specific rules on how to prioritise among conflicting norms, e.g. between international patent rights under the World Trade Organisation TRIPS regime and the fundamental right to health under United Nations human rights law, are missing. Political sentiments and economic policies often tend to prioritise business interests, including the protection of pharmaceutical patents held by multinational corporations, over contrasting societal interests, which has direct negative impacts on the realisation of economic and social human rights. In this context, this article takes account of moral philosophical reasoning, with particular consideration to the needs-based hierarchy established by Alan Gewirth in his conceptualisation of the principle of generic consistency. The article shows how, when applied to the concept of human dignity, the needs-based hierarchy can provide guidance on adequate prioritisation among conflicting legal norms, suggesting the necessity of protecting the most fundamental human needs over less essential economic interests.",2023,Government & Law,1
NIH funding for patents that contribute to market exclusivity of drugs approved 2010-2019 and the public interest protections of Bayh-Dole,; SCIENCE; INNOVATION; DISCOVERY; KNOWLEDGE; US,"Previous studies have shown that National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding contributed >$187 billion for basic or applied research related to the 356 drugs approved 2010-2019. This analysis asks how much of this funding led to patents cited as providing market exclusivity, patents that would be subject to the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act that promote and protect the public interest. The method involves identifying published research in PubMed related to the approved drugs (applied research) or their targets (basic research). NIH-funded projects (grants) funding these publications and patents arising from these projects were both identified in RePORT. Patents cited as providing market exclusivity were identified in DrugPatentWatch (which incorporates FDA Orange Book). NIH funded basic or applied research related to all 313 FDA-approved drugs 2010-2019 with at least one patent in DrugPatentWatch. This research comprised 350 thousand publications (9% applied research; 91% basic research) supported by 341 thousand fiscal years (project years) of NIH funding and $164 billion in NIH project year costs (17% applied research; 83% basic research). These NIH projects also produced 22,360 patents, 119 of which were cited in DrugPatentWatch as protecting 34/313 drugs. These patents were associated with 769 project years of NIH funding (0.23% total) and project year costs of $0.95 billion (0.59% total). Overall, only 1.5% of total NIH funding for applied research and 0.38% of total NIH funding for basic research was associated with patents in DrugPatentWatch. This analysis shows that very little of the NIH funding for research that contributes to new drug approvals leads to patents that provide market exclusivity and are subject to the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act that promote the public interest in practical applications of the research, reasonable use and pricing, and a return on this public sector investment. This suggests that the Bayh-Dole Act is limited in its ability to protect the public interest in the pharmaceutical innovations driven by NIH-funded research.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1

This study evaluates the impact of provincial policies on the commercialization of academic patents using spatial regression models and propensity score matching methods. It also provides a reference for optimizing university patent management. Considering provincial patent policies enacted in China in 2016 as the treatment, the results show no significant effect of provincial patent policies on rights definition and implementation economics on the commercialization of academic patents. However, promotion standard policies have a significant positive effect on the commercialization of academic patents. A significant negative spatial spillover effect is observed on the commercialization of academic patents among universities with similar innovation capabilities. Furthermore, non-geographic distances, such as innovation distance, positively affect competition among universities and their commercialization of academic patents. Therefore, local governments should consider the needs of academic inventors for title promotion when designing and introducing patent incentive policies for universities.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Is there a secular decline in disruptive patents? Correcting for measurement bias,Disruptive innovation; Truncation bias; Exclusion bias; US patent law change; ,"Despite tremendous growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, the popular press has recently raised concerns that disruptive innovation is slowing. These dire prognoses were driven in part by Park et al. (2023), a Nature publication that uses decades of data and millions of observations coupled with a novel quantitative metric (the CD index) that characterizes innovation in science and technology as either consolidating or disruptive. We challenge the (Park et al., 2023) patent findings, principally around concerns of truncation bias and exclusion bias. We show that 88 percent of the decrease in the average CD index over 1980-2010 reported by the authors can be explained by their truncation of all backward patent citations before 1976. We also show that this truncation bias varies by technology class. We further account for a change in U.S. patent law that allows for citations to patent applications in addition to patent grants-something ignored by the authors in their analysis-and update the analysis to 2016. We show that the number of highly disruptive patents has increased since 1980-particularly since 2008. Our results suggest caution in using the (Park et al., 2023) patent findings and conclusions as a basis for research and decision -making in public policy, industry restructuring or firm reorganization aimed at altering the current innovation landscape.",2024,Business & Economics,1

We consider a cost-reducing innovation by either an incumbent or a (potential) entrant. According to our analysis, when patent protection is high enough, the entrant is willing to pay more compared with the incumbent, it licenses the innovation exclusively, and it acts as a non-practicing entity. In the case of low patent protection, the threat of imitation discourages licensing agreements, and consequently, the incumbent ends up investing more. Thus, the level of patent protection impacts the structure of the market, affecting R&D appropriability and social welfare.",2020,Business & Economics,1

This issue has attracted the attention of many competition enforcement authorities and no consensus is reached as to the compatibility of such injunctive relief with competition law. This is also a hard and challenging problem faced by China. A coherent and balanced response is urgently needed under current China's legal framework. Therefore, this article proposes that a basic regulating approach should be established first to treat the seeking of injunctions by FRAND-encumbered SEP owners as an independent anti-competitive practice prohibited by the Anti-monopoly Law.

Global patent statistical analysis for drug testing technology,Drug detection; patent statistics; patent analysis; development trend; ,"BACKGROUND: In recent decades, illicit drug testing has become a high priority area in law enforcement and forensic analysis. OBJECTIVE: Since patents are the largest source of technical information in the world, patent database analysis for illicit drug testing is extremely important to effectively promote the development and protection of the related intellectual property rights. METHODS: In the present study, we first retrieve a database of 1732 drug detection patents using keywords and logical expressions related to the title, abstract, and claims, and subsequently discuss the current global patent statistics in detail. RESULTS: The relevant patent information is presented, including patent application quantity, filing country, ownership, and technical field. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we summarize the current development trend in drug testing and propose several suggestions focused on the bottleneck of analytical techniques.",2021,Health Care Sciences & Services; Engineering,1
"When mRNA technology meets patent law: innovation, barriers and public health",; ,"center dot The success of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has ushered in a new era of vaccine and therapeutic development. In this rapidly evolving field, top biotech and biopharma companies are constantly searching for new opportunities to create innovative treatments and vaccines.center dot However, the landscape of mRNA patents is getting complicated and dense, with an accumulation of partially overlapping patent rights that require multiple rights holders' permission for use and commercialization. Additionally, there are several pending patent lawsuits related to key components of mRNA platform technologies, with strong implications for follow-on innovation and technology diffusion within the field.center dot The case of mRNA technology-as often happens with emerging technologies-is therefore emblematic of the policy dilemma faced by patent law of how to balance economic incentives in a setting of cumulative innovation. This article maps out relevant legal factors that, under different conditions, might aggravate or mitigate the potential negative effects of patents in the field. Further, it sets a framework for more targeted examination of the identified issues.",2023,Government & Law,1
Looking at Patent Law: Patenting an Electrochemical Invention for Eradication of Microbes from the Surfaces of Implants-A Case Study,; ,"In this installment of our Looking at Patent Law series, we present a case study of the prosecution of U.S. Patent No. 9,616,142; Electrochemical Eradication of Microbes on Surfaces of Objects. We have chosen this invention to align with the focus of this issue of Interface on diversity and inclusion in electrochemical technology, science, and engineering. Notably, several of the inventors are female, including Dr. Esther S. Takeuchi who is a prolific inventor with numerous awards, honors, and recognitions. The '142 patent was issued on April 11, 2017 with co-inventors Mark Ehrensberger, Anthony Campagnari, Esther Takeuchi, Nicole Luke-Marshall, and Jeremy Gilbert. The patent is jointly assigned to The Research Foundation for the State University of New York and Syracuse University. The case study begins with a brief synopsis of the background of the invention followed by 1) a discussion of the parent and child patent applications associated with the invention, 2) inventor assignment and power of attorney designations, 3) election/restriction requirement, 4) acknowledgment of government march-in rights, 5) submission of an information disclosure statement and duty of candor, 6) summary of office actions, 7) summary of applicant response to non-final rejection, and 8) allowance of the patent application. With this case study, we hope to de-mystify the patent prosecution process and better prepare electrochemical and solid-state scientists, engineers and technologists to interact with their patent counsel regarding their inventions.

Navigating natural product-related patents in Australia and beyond,innovation; intellectual property; natural products; patents; ,"The field of natural products chemistry is ripe with innovation that underpins a broad range of industries. Patents are critical to incentivising the investment needed to drive this innovation and there is surprisingly broad scope to protect natural product-related inventions using patents. However, the patent process can be difficult to navigate and recent developments in case law, particularly in the United States (USA), have introduced further complexities into the patent system that undermine innovation in the natural products space. While steps are being taken to address these issues, we outline the requirements for patent eligibility in Australia, the US and Europe, and discuss the different aspects of natural products chemistry that may be considered patentable, to assist readers in navigating the current complexities of seeking patent protection.",2023,Chemistry,1

Measuring the quality of patents among Latin-American universities,Bibliometrics; Patent quality; Invention; University patents; Higher education; University; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE; PORTFOLIO; SCOPE; ACT,"Patents are essential for university technology diffusion to society; however, patent quality in universities, especially in Latin America, has been poorly studied. We create a quality index for patents granted to regional universities by using patent quality variables as patent production, technical relevance, use of top knowledge, technological scope, cooperation, and internationalization. Results show that, on average, Brazilian universities had higher quality than their peers in other countries and that Universidad Tecnologica de Panama occupies the first position of the ranking for 2016. The main contribution of this paper is to create the first Index for patent quality at universities in the region, and for what we know, the first country aggregated measure of patent quality for universities. This nobel measure is related to research quality in Scopus and Web of Science databases and can be used to complement international university rankings to measure a dimension not previously used by those rankings.",2022,Education & Educational Research,1
Early Disclosure of Invention and Reduced Duplication: An Empirical Test,AIPA; duplicative research; knowledge disclosure; patents; PRODUCT MARKET; PATENTS; SPILLOVERS; IDEAS,"Much work on innovation strategy assumes or theorizes that competition in innovation elicits duplication of research and that disclosure decreases such duplication. We validate this empirically using the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA), three complementary identification strategies, and a new measure of blocked future patent applications. We show that AIPA-intended to reduce duplication, through default disclosure of patent applications 18 months after filing-reduced duplication in the U.S. and European patent systems.

COPYRIGHT'S ADMINISTRATIVE LAW,; DECISION-MAKING; PROPERTY,"While a robust body of scholarship considers the regulatory dimensions of patent and copyright, there remains a puzzling absence of writing about copyright's administrative law. This Article remedies this lacuna in the literature. It begins by tracing the history of regulatory copyright, which dates to the first Copyright Act in 1790. This analysis shows that - despite the absence of scholarly attention to the topic - there is a longstanding connection between copyright and administrative law. The Article then considers the stakes of relying on agency governance in the absence of a theory of copyright's administrative law, which risks overdelegation, underdelegation, and institutional design flaws. It uses these failings to sketch out principles for identifying what copyright duties should (and should not) be committed to agencies. The Article then uses these principles to take a two-fold normative turn. First, it suggests several operational reforms to the work of copyright agencies that would take best advantage of its core competencies. Second, it analyses the doctrinal administrative law issues that would be raised by such reform. In so doing, this Article seeks to sketch out the heretofore unexplored territory of copyright's administrative law so that scholars and policymakers may better navigate it.",2021,Government & Law,1

THE EFFECT OF PATENT ATTORNEY FIRMS,appropriation; innovation; patent law firm; patent system; INNOVATION; MODELS; INDICATORS; EXPERTISE; MERGER; IMPACT,"The patent system underpins the business model of some of the fastest-growing companies. Used appropriately, it should support frontier technologies and nurture new firms. Used perniciously, it can stifle innovation and protect established technological behemoths. We analyze patent examination decisions at the American, European, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese patent offices and find evidence that patent attorneys have a surprisingly significant role in the patent system. Our results suggest that some forces within the examination system maintain the uneven playing field by allocating monopoly rights to inventors with better access to influential attorneys, rather than leveling it by favoring inventors with better, nonobvious ideas. Attorney quality is most important, vis-a-vis invention quality, in less codified and more rapidly changing technology areas such as software and ICT.",2023,Business & Economics,1

We examine this question by exploiting the staggered adoption of BITNET across U.S. universities in the 1980s. BITNET, an early version of the Internet, enabled e-mail-based knowledge exchange and collaboration among academics. After the adoption of BITNET, university-connected inventors increase patenting substantially. The effects are driven by collaborative patents by new inventor teams. The patents induced by ICT are closely related to science. In contrast, we neither find an effect on patents not closely related to science nor on corporate inventors unconnected to universities.",2022,Business & Economics,1

However, such an estimator neglects the possibility that academic patent activities follow a spatial autoregressive process with respect to the dependent variable. The objective of this study was to propose a spatial difference-in-differences estimator accounting for possible spatial spillover effects. In this study, an empirical analysis of a sample of 31 Chinese provinces from 2010 to 2019 indicates that an incentive patent policy has a positive impact on the output and commercialization of academic patents, with positive effects also spilling over into neighboring provinces. This study further found that incentive patent policies play a placebo role in academic patent activities. Provincial patent policies are merely a proxy for other variables that characterize the systemic differences between provinces that implement patent policies and those that do not. Therefore, the promotion of academic patent activities cannot be attributed to policy incentives.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

Patents Do Not Measure Innovation Success,Product innovation; Process innovation; Patents; Trade secrets; Product announcements; Insider trading; Disclosure choice; Financing innovation; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TRADE; VALUATION; SECRETS; IMPACT,"We find that a company's patent filings and citations are not good measures of R&D success or failure, even when compared to firms in the same industry. Instead, our analysis reveals that patent counts reflect the firm's mix of product and process innovation. Intuitively, competitor infringements of process innovation are difficult to detect, suggesting these innovations are better protected via trade secret than patents. We document that non-patenting firms frequently announce valuable new products, even though they emphasize process over product innovation. Insider trading in non-patenting firms generates positive excess returns, while such activity in patenting firms yields ordinary returns. The Uniform Trade Secrets Act induced firms to switch from patenting to non-patenting, leading to lower analysts and institutional following. Financial intermediaries potentially influence the disclosure of innovation rather than research and development success (Aghion et al., 2013; Bena et al., 2017). Overall, our tests indicate that patents and citations signify the nature of innovation rather R&D success.",2020,Business & Economics,1

The first determines the effect of inventor, assignee and country for receiving the first citation by patents. Life tables concern the time-lag between the dates of granting and receiving the first citation by patents. Bradford's method is also established as a technique for categorization of patents, inventors, assignees and countries as a prerequisite for survival analysis. The research materials consist of 2837 patents in the area of 'purification, separation, or recovery of hydrocarbon components' which were classified under the classes 585/800 and 585/868 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The findings showed that Bradford's method complies with the distribution of citations of patents, first inventors and assignees. It means that Bradford's distribution is well suited for determination of key patents, inventors and assignees in an area too. Cox regression revealed that only the inventors' variable decides for receiving the first citation in terms of frequency, degrees of their inventions and citations. Life table data revealed that one half of the first citations were received in the first 10 years. As a conclusion, survival analysis methods provide the possibility for deciding technology lifetime and for predicting the determinants for the flow of knowledge through citation analysis.",2020,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,1

Non-price Exploitation in ICT Patents Licenses,Dominance; Fairness; Article 102 TFEU; Standards; IoT; FRAND; STANDARD-ESSENTIAL PATENTS; COMPETITION LAW; FRAND; HUAWEI; DISCRIMINATION; INJUNCTIONS; INNOVATION; SEPS,"This paper analyses controversial patent licensing conditions in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector as unfair trading conditions under Art. 102(a) TFEU. It argues that the application of the Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation does not prevent the assessment of patent licensing conditions under Art. 102 if the licensor is dominant in the market. Hence, the article examines four categories of controversial licensing conditions in the light of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union under Art. 102(a): grant-back clauses, no-challenge clauses, portfolio-wide licenses, and contract term decoupled from patent validity. Developing old precedents in new application cases, the abuse-of-dominance analysis finds that each license clause is capable of anti-competitive exploitative effects, as much as offsetting justifications. As a result, the qualification of any such clause as unfair needs a case-by-case approach considering the overall content of the ICT patent licensing agreement. Whether the overall efficiencies outweigh the anti-competitive effects is always a question of degree. Nonetheless, this article contributes to legal predictability by identifying the opposing economic arguments of dominant patent licensors and complaining licensees. It concludes that both parties have strings to their bows.",2023,Government & Law,1
The Localization of Drug Patent Linkage System in China: Where Should It Go?,drug patent linkage; drug competition; evergreen patent; approval waiting period; reverse payment settlement agreements; ,"The improvement of drug accessibility needs to be promoted by both drug innovation and drug imitation. Given the current situation in China where both the quantity of drug innovation and the quality of imitation need to be improved, China's drug patent linkage system should primarily aim to promote competition in the drug market and take the elimination of potential competition-restricting effects as the basic orientation for improvement. NMPA and CNIPA can address the issue of evergreen patents by conducting substantive reviews of patent information and punishing deliberate improper registration of patent information. To prevent the abuse of the approval waiting period system, in substantive law, it is necessary to further clarify the constitutive elements of liability for damages caused by the abuse of the approval waiting period system; in procedural law, parties initiating litigation (or requesting an adjudication) may be required to provide guarantees. Regarding the issue of reverse payment settlement agreements, it is necessary to add provisions of the expiration of the exclusivity period for the first generic drug and the record review of reverse payment settlement agreements. For reverse payment settlement behaviors that harm social public interests, the people's procuratorate shall initiate civil public interest litigation.",2024,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1

This paper shows a proof-of-concept test case from the United States: predicting outcomes of post-grant inter partes review (IPR) proceedings for invalidating patents. The objectives are to compare decision-tree and deep learning methods, validate interpretability methods, and demonstrate outcome prediction based on party briefs. Specifically, this study compares and validates two distinct approaches: (1) representing documents with term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), training XGBoost gradient-boosted decision-tree models, and using SHAP for interpretation. (2) Deep learning of document text in context, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) with attention, and comparing LIME and attention visualization for interpretability. The methods are validated on the task of automatically determining case outcomes from unstructured written decision opinions, and then used to predict trial institution or denial based on the patent owner's preliminary response brief. The results show how interpretable deep learning architecture classifies successful/unsuccessful response briefs on temporally separated training and test sets. More accurate prediction remains challenging, likely due to the fact-specific, technical nature of patent cases and changes in applicable law and jurisprudence over time.",2022,Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science; Physics,1
An Integrated Method to Acquire Technological Evolution Potential to Stimulate Innovative Product Design,technological evolution law; TRIZ; BP neural network; international patent classification; company's technological distance; INTERNATIONAL PATENT CLASSIFICATION; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; TECHNICAL SYSTEMS; TRIZ; KNOWLEDGE; IDENTIFICATION; DISTANCE; SERVICE; TRENDS,"Fast and effective forecasting of the new generation of products is key to enhancing the competitiveness of a company in the market. Although the technological evolution laws in the theory of the solution of inventive problems (TRIZ) have been used to predict the potential states of products for innovation, there is a lack of effective methods to select the best technological evolution law consistently with product replacement and update, and acquiring potentially new technologies and solutions, which relies heavily on designers' experience and makes it impossible for designers to efficiently use the technological evolution laws to stimulate product innovation. Aimed to bridge this gap, this paper proposes an integrated method consisting of three main steps, combining the technological evolution laws with back propagation neural network (BPNN), international patent classification (IPC) knowledge and company's technological distance. The best technical evolution law is first searched by a BPNN. The functional verbs and effects in the IPC are then extracted and searched for potential technologies in the Spyder-integrated development environment. Finally, the company's technological distance is used to select analogous sources of potential solutions in the patent database. The final innovative design is determined based on the ideality. The proposed method is applied in the development of a steel pipe-cutting machine to verify its feasibility. The proposed method reduces the dependence on designers' experience and provides a way to access cross-domain technologies, providing a systematic approach for the technological evolution laws to motivate innovative product design.",2023,Mathematics,1
Intellectual Property Investment at the International Court of Justice After Certain Iranian Assets,Patent Protection; Intellectual Property Investments; World Court; Assets; Interpretation; CONTINUITY; LAW,"In Certain Iranian Assets, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) acknowledges that the protection of patents is part of the broader remit of a corporate entity with legal personality in international law. The case was not about intellectual property investments, nor was it a case about investment protection in the proper sense of that body of law. However, when the Court, in very light form, mentions the protection of patents, the World Court raises the bar for the dynamics of intellectual property investments in international law. This comment seeks to do two things. Frist, it will map out how the ICJ came to acknowledge the protection of patent rights in corporate entities and secondly, it will set out the parameters in which the ICJ develop its own version of investment protection as such. Certain Iranian Assets is an interesting case since it covers a range of issues with a high rate of declarations, separate opinions, and partial dissent on different matters.

Barriers To US Biosimilar Market Growth: Lessons From Biosimilar Patent Litigation,; PRESCRIPTION DRUGS,"High biologic drug prices have placed substantial strain on the US health care system. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), passed in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars-versions of originator biologic drugs made by different manufacturers-to help address this issue. However, a decade after its passage, the BPCIA has spurred only limited competition. We examined the role that litigation has played in this muted success, reviewing all lawsuits related to the BPCIA filed between its enactment and August 1, 2020. Our review identified two key problems: noncompliance with steps in the complex litigation process established by the BPCIA and large numbers of patents enforced by originator manufacturers. Both actions have contributed to frequent confidential settlements between originator and biosimilar manufacturers that have delayed the availability of biosimilars. To facilitate more timely biosimilar entry, policy makers should consider limits on patent prosecution, compulsory public patent listing, and enhanced antitrust enforcement.",2021,Health Care Sciences & Services,1

They also explore more. This effect only exists among firms in less competitive industries, firms with lower institutional ownership (IO), and firms with overconfident chief executive officers (CEOs); this effect is mainly driven by the reduction in the value of U.S.-originated patents.

A Feasible Pathway for Open Access to Human Embryonic Stem Cell Patents-With China's Open License for Patent as the Entry Point,Human embryonic stem cell (hESC); open license for patent; open access; patent; China; PATENTABILITY,"China has entered the second stage on how to give full play to the value of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) patents, and the key to the issue is the open license instead of setting up the patent thicket. China has added the open license for patent to its patent law and multiple provincial-level administrative regions, including Beijing and Shanghai, have successively carried out open license pilot programs and achieved phased achievements. China's bold innovation in the open license for patent may have a positive impact on promoting the open access of hESC patents. From the perspective of patentees, it provides policy incentives and enhances the protection of rights. In terms of licensees, it reasonably determines the license fee and safeguards stable contract validity.

However, the tension between patent rights and the public good has been heightened as pharma companies developed new vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Wealthy governments paid well for vaccines and received ample supplies, while low- and middle-income countries struggled to obtain access to any vaccines. Some countries called for pharmaceutical companies to waive their patent protections for vaccines in order to facilitate the worldwide manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This paper will examine the rationale of patent protection and patent waiver issues, then compare these concepts with ethical constructs and a Jewish perspective.",2023,Government & Law,1
Dynamic contracting for innovation under ambiguity,Ambiguity; Dynamic contract; Patent law; Innovation; R&D; ROBUSTNESS,"Outsourcing of research is commonly observed in knowledge-intensive industries such as biotech. We model innovation as an ambiguous stochastic process with dynamically consistent updating. We assume that the research labs are less ambiguity averse than the commercial firms. We characterize the optimal sequence of short-term contracts governing innovation, and show how it facilitates ambiguity-sharing. This ambiguity sharing agreement mitigates the dynamic moral hazard problem, resulting in monotonically decreasing investment and preventing equilibrium delay. Compared to an ambiguity-neutral policymaker's benchmark, the research alliances stop experimenting too early, and may liquidate the project even after being patented. The problems are structural, redesigned patent laws cannot solve both of these problems. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2022,Business & Economics,1
TRIPS AGREEMENT AND MALAYSIAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS: DATA EXCLUSIVITY v PATENT,Intellectual property; protection mechanism; patent; data exclusivity; TRIPS agreement; INFORMATION; ACCESS,"This study analyses the provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement with respect to the various intellectual property protection mechanisms. The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Malaysia is a TRIPS compliance country and have established intellectual property laws including the incorporation of data exclusivity laws. This study also illustrates that data exclusivity and patent are two different intellectual property protection mechanisms required under the TRIPS Agreement. Moreover, this study clarifies the misconception that data exclusivity and patents are somehow related; such that data exclusivity is an extension of patent rights and that it is often regarded as a TRIPS-plus provision. The study is conducted based on qualitative research, predicated on primary sources such as the TRIPS Agreement and the various laws with respect to intellectual property in Malaysia. It is further supported by secondary sources from journals and information provided on relevant authorities' websites. The results of the study show that Malaysia is a TRIPS compliance country and that data exclusivity is an intellectual property protection mechanism that is established pursuant to Article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement. Hence, this study concludes that member countries of the TRIPS Agreement that have established data exclusivity protection mechanism to protect undisclosed data submitted to their respective authorities for the purpose of marketing approval of pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical products, including Malaysia, are indeed in compliance with the obligation set under Article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement.",2020,Government & Law,1
Increasing returns and path dependence in knowledge creation and their effects on the dynamics of patent pools,Patent pools; Procompetitive patents; Knowledge creation; Urn processes; Patent dynamics; SEQUENTIAL INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; ANTICOMMONS; PROPERTY; LAW,"This paper analyzes pro-competitive patent pools using basic premises of knowledge creation and their reflections for modern patent pools in the presence of intellectual property rights (IPR). We argue that cumulativeness and combinatorial nature of knowledge production correspond to path dependence and increasing returns in the realm of the knowledge economy. This correspondence allows us to model dy-namics of modern patent pools using nonlinear Polya urns. We show that increasing the number of firms contributing to a patent pool of complementary patents or increasing the rate of having infringing patents favor the contributing firms' coexistence chance. On the other hand, increasing these parameters nega-tively affects the non-contributing firm's relative number of patents. In particular, the probability that the frequency of the latter firm's patents vanishes asymptotically increases as these parameters grow. As a result, we conclude that the probability that the market will be dominated by the firms contributing to pro-competitive patent pool increases as the pool enlarges.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The Optimal Patent Portfolio of The Technology Standards Alliances in Innovation Competition,Optimal patent portfolio; technology standards alliances; innovation competition; patent pools; MODEL,"Unlike the dominant theories based on the rigid assumption that technology standards must contain only essential patents, this paper discusses the standard alliances that are engaged in their cumulative innovation. Its focus is particularly on a more realistic setting that a standard alliance should contain both the essential and the non-essential patents. We use the essential-patent's ratio, which denotes the percentage of the essential patents in the total patents in a standard, as the cumulative innovation model's core variable. The mathematical analysis illustrates that the essential-patent's ratio performs an important role in the arguments' standards. There is an optimal portfolio that maximizes the alliances' efficiency in an innovation competition. It implies that the social welfare effects depend on the dynamic trade-off between the long-term technical gap caused by the technological upgrades' missing opportunities and the short-term welfare losses that consumers may suffer. The patents' and antitrust laws should tolerate a certain number of non-essential patents being contained by the technology standards.",2022,Business & Economics; International Relations,1

We find that the FTDA raised treated firms' operating profits and was followed by a spike in trademark lawsuits and lower entry and exit in affected product markets. Treated firms reduced R&D spending, produced fewer patents and new products, and recalled a higher number of unsafe products. Our results suggest that stronger trademark protection negatively affected innovation and product quality.",2020,Business & Economics,1

When dissatisfied with the amount of compensation, employee inventors can ask for a review by an independent board or directly in court and claim additional remuneration. The study explores the existence of ex-ante indicators that would help distinguish inventors entitled to higher/lower additional compensation. We build on the patent quality framework and test the explanatory power of the ex-ante patent value indicator, the patent family size, on the additional rewards awarded to employee inventors. A novel dataset of court cases heard between 1981 and 2017 in three civil-law countries (Germany, France, and Japan) is used. Our findings indicate a consistently positive effect of both simple and GDP-weighted patent family indicators on the additional remuneration granted. The main finding is as follows: if the court grants positive additional compensation, we observe an average 68% increase in compensation when the number of countries covered by the patent doubles; alternatively, if the total GDP of the countries covered by the patent doubles, the compensation increases by app. 59%. These findings, along with others from the study, can be beneficial for R&D managers, intellectual property managers, and other executives, as well as innovative employees, in estimating the remuneration amount for employee inventions.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Fire Rings,Artistic design; Individuality; Copyright protection; Infringement; Works of applied art; Intellectual creations; Individual character; Unfair competition; Priority of use; ,"1. It cannot be generally concluded that a minimalist design or a reduction to the essential establishes necessary individuality. What is decisive is that the work clearly stands out artistically in its overall impression from the then known set of forms for the product in question (here: barbecue devices), i.e. whether the artistic design within the scope of its purpose is so clearly distinguishable from the previously known forms that it appears to be unique or original.2. The fact that technical requirements do not play a role in copyright law is not true. However, there is a difference between compliance with the patent requirements and the question of whether the patent specifies a particular design.3. The scope of protection for a utility object is all the smaller, the less pronounced the individual character conferred on the work by the exploitation of the creative scope.4. Only a party whose sign has been in use for a longer period of time can invoke the unfair competition law protection of Art. 3(1)(d) Act against Unfair Competition. The decisive factor is an earlier proven, outwardly perceptible use in business transactions; the mere intention to use the sign is not sufficient.",2024,Government & Law,1

We study the impact of a natural experiment that took place in 1995 when U.S. patent law was amended with a special provision that provided an incentive for firms to hasten research. We also utilize the randomized assignment of examiners to patent applications to identify firms under time pressure. We find that firms under time pressure assemble larger research teams. With innovation races becoming more competitive globally, our finding sheds light on the trend of increasing teamwork in research.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Jurisdictional Changes in Indian Patent Enforcement - Comment on the Ericsson v. CCI Decision,Intellectual property; Jurisdiction; Competition law; SEP policy; ,"The jurisdiction of the Competition Commission of India in all matters concerning patent law has recently been extinguished by the Delhi High Court in the case of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (Publ) v. Competition Commission of India. In a rather sharp distinction to its counterpart agencies in other advanced markets, such as the European Commission, the Indian antitrust authority can no longer assess any claims related to patent licensing. This power has been shifted to the office of the Controller of Patents. The intent of the court might have been to refine the dispute resolution mechanism. However, in paying heed only to rules of statutory interpretation, the division bench has left unresolved several substantive implications arising from this ruling. This new perspective ignores the accommodation made in competition law for intellectual property carve-outs as well as Indian competition law policy fashioned after foreign jurisdictions. It deepens the discord in inter-regulatory communication, reduces the choice of forum for future litigants, consequently also curbing their choice of remedy. Since compulsory licensing is not a favourable remedy in technical standardisation disputes, and it remains the only remedy that the IP Office can grant, it is likely that, as a consequence of the this judgement, disputing parties will view judicial venues as the sole viable venues for SEP dispute resolution even when the content of their dispute attracts antitrust penalties.",2024,Government & Law,1
Patent Invalidation Procedures in the WTO Member BRICS Countries: India Provides a Model Legislation,Brazil; China; India; South Africa; patent opposition; public health; TRIPS; WTO; MEDICINES; ACCESS,"Eighty percent of the world's population lives in emerging markets, and a significant portion of this population is not receiving healthcare or at least is not receiving the healthcare they need. This is an issue experienced in all of the BRICS countries as well. The BRICS countries particularly need drugs for the treatment and management of infectious and communicable diseases. The affordability of healthcare is one of the key priorities of the BRICS countries. These goals may not necessarily be in line with the patent laws of the BRICS countries which are also members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). This article examines the patent invalidation procedures of the four WTO member BRICS countries, namely India, China, Brazil, and South Africa with the aim of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of their procedural safeguards and learning from their experiences. The presence of a functional patent opposition model is of utmost importance for the BRICS countries, since this allows for the invalidation or opposition of patents that have been granted in their respective jurisdictions. However, except for India, none of the other WTO member BRICS countries have developed a well-thought-out patent opposition model. This study argues that the BRICS group provides a viable forum for India to promote its distinguished patent invalidation model. In turn, the WTO member BRICS countries can learn from India's pro-health patent opposition model and reform their national patent laws to align with their public health priorities. This is especially important in the context of the pandemic like COVID-19, for example.",2024,Government & Law,1

The scope of software patent protection and the social and private value of software patenting are hence central to recent policy debates. The landmark 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Alice Corp v. CLS Bank had a profound impact on software patenting, drastically narrowing the scope of patent protection on software innovation. We theorize and provide empirical evidence that a narrower scope of software patent protection is associated with a greater degree of open source activities and improved sales in software firms. We also evaluate how individual firm's ex ante software patent stock may moderate the proposed relationships. These findings offer insights into the roles of patent scope for software innovation in the digital economy and have important implications for the software patent and digital innovation literatures. They also have compelling implications for patent policies on software and software-related inventions, such as artificial intelligence, blockchains, cloud computing, and other emerging digital innovations.",2024,Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics,1
PATENTS AS SIGNALS OF QUALITY IN CROWDFUNDING,; INVESTMENTS; PROPERTY,"Patents and crowdfunding both attempt to foster early stage innovations. In theory, patents signal quality and value to attract investment and buyers and ultimately facilitate commercialization. Crowdfunding allows multiple individuals to make small contributions to finance start-up ventures. This Article reports on two related studies investigating the interaction between these two innovation tools by determining the impact of a crowdfunding campaign's patent status on the campaign's success and delivery. The first study examines 9,184 Kickstarter campaigns in patent-eligible categories to determine whether patented or patent-pending labeled projects are more likely to reach their funding goal and in turn achieve actual, on-time delivery when compared to non-patented projects. This study finds, perhaps surprisingly, that patented projects are not more likely to obtain funding compared to non-patented ones. In contrast, patent-pending projects are more successful in getting funded. The second study confirms this preference for patent-pending projects but not patented ones through a series of laboratory experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk'). The MTurk results also indicate that patent-pending status, as compared to patented status, is more likely to be noticed by potential backers and an identified reason for such backers to invest and buy crowdfunded products. These results provide insight into whether patents (1) act as signals to attract funding and buyers, and (2) assist in commercialization in the crowdfunding context. These results also inform the proper focus of patent marking statutes.",2021,Government & Law,1
Problems and strategies to maintain the existence of domestic registered patents in Indonesia to promote the economic growth,annual/maintenance fee; economic stimulus growth theory; elimination; legal politics; patent; ,"The number of acquisitions of Indonesian domestic patents is still low, while Article 130 letter d of Law Number 13 of 2016 concerning Patents regulates the abolition of patents due to the patent holder not fulfilling the obligation to pay the annual fee. This provision causes the loss of registered patent rights that have been hard to obtain, while the legal protection is still long, and there is still potential for commercialization value. It is feared that this will become one of the obstacles in the effort to increase the acquisition of domestic patents which in the end will also hamper Indonesia's economic growth. This article seeks to formulate the problems and strategies in maintaining the existence of domestically registered patents to be able to provide adequate protection for the exclusive rights of inventors while at the same time being able to support national economic growth.",2024,Government & Law,1

In this respect, the study was conducted to understand patentability nature and prosecution timelines for patent protected indigenous dairy technologies. Investigators had examined 28 herbal pharmaceutical patent grant(s) from grassroots innovators/outstanding knowledge holders. Patent applications were filed between 2007-2014, prosecution were held and accorded patent grant during 2019-2022. The study noted that Section 3 (d), (e) and (p) were principal factors involved while defending veterinary pharmaceutical patent applications. About 46 percent did not have Section 3 (d) objections inferring these medicinal practices followed by dairy farmers were unique. It was observed that majority of patent grants were in product category illustrating transformation of national patent regime from process patent to product-patent grant system. Overall time taken for availing grant was about ten years with an average prosecution period of 2.6 years. Therapeutic efficacy, synergistic action and suitable claim amendments are pertinent features in responding to prosecution stages.

Commercialization of academic patents in Chinese universities: Antecedents and spatial spillovers,Commercialization of university patents; University innovation ecosystem; Basic research; Spatial spillover; China; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; ECONOMICS; OUTPUTS; GROWTH; ACT,"The commercialization of academic patents is a basic means for universities to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial innovation of enterprises. However, among developing countries, the commercialization rate of university patents is generally low. This study utilizes data from 65 universities which are directly under the Ministry of Education of China to analyze the influencing factors and mechanisms of academic patent commercialization. The findings show that the proportion of associate professors, the size of service staff transforming research and development achievement, and the proportion of basic research funding in universities are positively correlated with the commercialization rate of university patents. In addition, these factors indirectly affect the commercialization of university patents by affecting neighboring universities; that is, there are spatial spillover effects in the commercialization of university patents between neighboring universities. These empirical results indicate that universities can promote the commercialization of university patents by optimizing the structure of faculty, developing the R&D achievement transformation service staff team, and strengthening investment in basic research.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
High innovators?

Adopting the process-based view of innovation, we hypothesize that marijuana's increased use and related consequences after its legalization affect innovators' behavior and social environment during the innovation process, which in turn impacts regional innovation. Utilizing the staggered adoption of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) by 20 states between 1996 and 2013 as a quasi-experimental setting, we find that legalizing medical marijuana reduces the overall output of regional innovation as proxied by patents' total forward-citation count aggregated by innovator location. Further analyses decomposing the overall output into patent quantity and quality reveal that the quantity of certain patents rises after states' medical marijuana legalization. More importantly, these analyses show that the quality of all patents, especially that of hit patents, deteriorates, leading to a net negative effect on the overall output. These tests further suggest that different findings concerning patent quantity and quality are related to marijuana legalization's diverse influence on innovators' individual and collaborative effectiveness during the innovation process. The decline in innovation output and quality after the adoption of MMLs is robust to the use of additional identification strategies. The evidence suggests that legalizing medical marijuana has an adverse effect on regional innovation activity.",2023,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,1
Lessons from India and Thailand for Cambodia's future implementation of the TRIPS Agreement for pharmaceutical patents,access to medicines; Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights; intellectual property; least developed country; TRIPS flexibilities; TRIPS-plus; ,"Cambodia is expected to graduate from least developed country (LDC) status in the near future, at which time it will be required to make patents available for pharmaceutical products and processes to meet its obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Given its impending transition from LDC status, there is a need to balance Cambodia's intellectual property (IP) policies and regulations with public health priorities to ensure access to affordable life-saving medicines. This will be critical to achieving universal health coverage, one of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. This paper examines Cambodia's IP laws and regulations to identify provisions which could reduce access to affordable generic medicines when it starts to grant patents for pharmaceuticals. It systematically compares Cambodia's IP laws and regulations applicable to patents with those of Thailand and India-two developing countries which have had some successes in preserving access to medicines despite the introduction of pharmaceutical patents. It identifies lessons for Cambodia from the experiences of Thailand and India in implementing TRIPS and using TRIPS flexibilities such as compulsory licensing to ensure access to a sustainable supply of affordable generic medicines. India's experience of implementing TRIPS offers a practical and valuable lesson in applying TRIPS for the greatest public benefit. Thailand, although it has not utilised TRIPS flexibilities as extensively as India, also offers valuable lessons in adapting and interpreting IP law to ensure sustainable access to generic medicines, especially in relation to compulsory licencing. Key recommendations for reform for Cambodia include strengthening the use of preventive and remedial TRIPS flexibilities and removing criminal sanctions for patent infringements. Cambodia should reject any TRIPS-plus provisions in its patent legislation, avoid membership of bilateral or plurilateral trade agreements that include TRIPS-plus provisions and avoid signing patent treaties and agreements designed to facilitate the granting of patents.",2023,Government & Law,1

While this has translated into several public policies explicitly targeting them, there is little evidence on their effectiveness. This article provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Start-up Act, a policy intervention aimed at supporting innovative start-ups in Italy. We construct a unique database encompassing detailed information on firm balance sheets, employment, firm demographics, patents and bank-firm relationships for all Italian start-ups. We use conditional difference-in-differences and instrumental variable strategies to evaluate the impact of the Start-up Act on firm performance. Results show that the policy induces a significant increase in several firm outcomes whereas no effect is detected in patenting propensity and survival chances. We also document that the policy alleviates financial frictions characterizing innovative start-ups through the provision of tax credits for equity and a public guarantee scheme which, respectively, trigger an increase in the probability of receiving VC and accessing bank credit.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Parodying the Biotech Industry :Judy Malloy's OK Genetic Engineering as a Critique of Intellectual Property,; ,"In this article, I consider Judy Malloy's durational performance and multimedia artwork, OK Genetic Engineering (OKGE), 1983-86, in relation to evolving intellectual property laws in the United States and the progression of neoliberalism in the San Francisco Bay Area. Scholars across disciplines have considered the myriad implications of the landmark decisions that allowed for the patenting of genetically engineered lifeforms. These new laws paved the way for the creation of the biotechnology industry, challenged existing conceptions of what constitutes a lifeform, and extended the neoliberal privatization of all things public. Malloy's imagined biotech company, OKGE, incorporated patents, trademarks, and copyright into its many iterations. Thus, the artwork critiqued not only new patent laws, but also intellectual property at large. I argue that Malloy's OKGE relied on the ephemerality of performance, the distribution of materials through the mail-art network, and the cheapness of her chosen materials to reject intellectual property and the harmful effects it had on creative expression and the public good.",2023,Art,1

Crucial to its success will be the harmonization of geographical variation in national jurisdictions. Germany offers a unique opportunity to explore such harmonization, as plaintiffs can choose between twelve regional courts to file a patent suit, resulting in different patent court practices within the same jurisdiction. Adopting a legal geography perspective, we examine the appellate process as a mechanism that reconciles regional variation in court practices. Based on more than 100 decisions from 34 contentious litigations that went through all instances up to the Federal Court of Justice between 2005 and 2019, we find that decision reversals, case citations and guiding principles are important tools to improve error correction and judicial consistency within an IP system. We see these instruments as crucial for national harmonization also in the upcoming European framework.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Improving the Patent Notice System: Replacing the Duty to Mark with a Unified Patent-Product Database,; ,"The U.S. patent system is deficient in giving the public proper notice of what technologies are under patent protection. The current system relies on patent marking, which involves imprinting products with patent information that cover the product, to give constructive notice to the public. Recent data indicates that marking products with a website-called virtual marking-is not widely used. The problem lies with the overall costs, risks, and impracticability of marking certain products. Given the already dubious nature of constructive notice, the lack of virtual marking is a sign that patent law should improve its notice system. The lack of notice contributes to innocent infringement and an overall high societal cost that cuts against innovation. This Note argues that a unified patent-product database would improve notice to inventors to prevent infringement and generally encourage innovation. The database could borrow ideas from an effective database like the Food and Drug Administration's Orange Book, a well-established drug database for the pharmaceutical industry. This Note also looks into how other components of the Patent Notice System would be improved, including the current U.S. patent database and the patent disclosure system.",2021,Government & Law,1

Consequently, most research-intensive firms face financial constraints (FC). Some suggest patents act as signals to reduce asymmetries, attracting external financing. Yet, prior findings are mixed. We integrate literature on FC with signaling to explore these inconsistent conclusions. We argue ambiguity in previous studies results from examining patents as sending a single signal. We examine impacts of three firm-level attributes on FC - use of emergent technology inputs, firm age, and repeat alliance partners. We demonstrate consideration of multiple simultaneous signals provides better insights into the patenting-FC relationship.",2020,Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
INVENTOR-ENTREPRENEURS: PATENTS AND PATENT LICENSING IN THE EARLY REPUBLIC,Invention; Patents; Patent law; Licensing; Entrepreneurship; Samuel Hopkins; ,"Independent inventors have limited routes to secure financial returns on the time and capital they invest to develop and realize a new idea. Research into two centuries of inventors has identified their options as licensing patents once they are issued, selling inventions (and patents) to existing companies, forging consulting arrangements with operating firms, or raising funds and starting a business. This article explores patent licensing as an entrepreneurial approach using a case study of the largely unknown licensing program undertaken by Samuel Hopkins after receiving the first U.S. patent. A license agreement signed between Hopkins and Eli Cogswell, a potash manufacturer in Vermont, offers a case study of how an inventor-entrepreneur worked in the early American republic. It also provides insights into the links between intellectual property and entrepreneurship, the mindset of inventor-entrepreneurs, and the challenges of bringing a new technology to market at a foundational moment in U.S. history.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1

This paper seeks to address the role of intellectual property (IP) law in addressing the problem of the COVID-19 pandemic. We suggest that the current international IP law regime and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement are not insurmountable obstacles for access to a successful COVID-19 vaccine. The publicly advocated fundamental reform or even abolition of the present IP law regime under serious information asymmetries might be counterproductive and distortive. Via existing compulsory licensing, advance purchase agreements and the employment of patent-pools, research subsidies, reward mechanisms and reputational sanctions, governments can take the steps needed to effectively overcome any IP-associated barriers to access to crucial medicines/vaccines, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the current wave of medical research on COVID-19 suggests the previous vaccine R&D 'failures' were driven by the modest demand for such vaccines and were not due to an inadequate IP-incentive stream. The paper also suggests today's EU competition law rules on the horizontal exchange of information could be seen as an impediment to innovation and thus be temporary suspended.",2022,Government & Law,1

The Ninth Circuit's recent decision in FTC v. Qualcomm has rejected the role of antitrust law within standard setting markets. The Ninth Circuit's decision is a crucial misunderstanding of antitrust doctrine and needs to be corrected before the fifth generation (5G, of cellular networks is fully implemented. Legal scholars and former enforcement officials have stressed the importance of antitrust law to enforce FRAND agreements and prevent patent holdup. However, in light of FTC v. Qualcomm, the current debate concerning antitrust law's role in standard setting markets is in a state of flux. First, this Note expands upon the current enforcement debate between the FTC and the DOJ. Second, the Note analyzes Qualcomm's no license, no chips policy and argues that it is a nuanced form of patent holdup. Third, the Note will evaluate the Ninth Circuit's decision. Lastly, the Note affords some creative solutions that could be adopted by SSOs if antitrust law is no longer a viable enforcement tool. This Note intends to supplement the argument for antitrust enforcement as well as provide a new perspective to the debate in the aftermath of FTC v. Qualcomm.",2021,Government & Law,1

Empirical analysis of more than 3.9 million U.S. applications finds minority and women applicants are significantly less likely to secure a patent relative to the balance of inventors. Further analysis indicates that a portion of this bias is introduced during prosecution at the Patent Office, independent of the quality of the application.

Addressing Criminal Liability for Misuse of Trade Secrets Under Australian Law: Is the Current Legal Framework Adequate to Protect the Interests of Owners of Trade Secrets?,Trade secrets; Espionage and Foreign Interference Act; Economic Espionage Act; DTSA; TRIPS Agreement; Patents; ACT,"The emergence and dominance of knowledge-based economies have heightened the importance of trade secrets as a currency for attaining competitiveness in the market and driving innovation. Yet espousing policies to govern trade secret protection, especially in the criminal law sphere, was not something on which legislative and regulatory policymakers traditionally focused. Recent legislative incentives at a global level have caused the tide to shift and, after decades of being somewhat neglected, the questions pertaining to criminal liability for trade secret misuse are finally gaining attention. The Australian response to recent initiatives ensued in 2018 with the enactment of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (EFI Act) which introduced the first statutory provisions dedicated to criminalisation of state-sponsored theft (economic espionage) of trade secrets. This Act, however, does not provide a comprehensive legal framework to address criminal liability for trade secret misuse, as it leaves outside the scope of its regulation the criminalisation of the theft of trade secrets by individuals for their own benefit. This paper analyses the adequacy of the Australian legal regime concerning criminal liability for trade secret misuse. The analysis is informed by a comparison of the legal provisions of the Australian trade secret regime with that adopted in the United States (U.S.) which currently offers a comprehensive framework of protection and criminalises economic espionage as well as the theft of trade secrets. This comparative analysis serves to determine: first, whether the one way avenue of statutory protection under Australian law suffices to protect the interests of the owners of trade secrets; and, second, whether a potential reform of the regime designed to include dedicated statutory provisions to criminalise the theft of trade secrets, as is the case in the U.S., could potentially afford a more adequate protection of the interests of trade secret owners.",2024,Government & Law,1
Settled: Patent characteristics and litigation outcomes in the pharmaceutical industry,Pharmaceutical drugs; Patent protection; Paragraph IV settlement; INNOVATION,"A pharmaceutical company that seeks to produce a generic version of a brand drug before patent expiration can trigger a Paragraph IV litigation. However, generic and brand companies may avoid litigation through settlement, which sometimes involves payment to the generic company to delay generic entry. This behavior would be problematic if the settlement option was used to protect patents with low social value. This study explores the relationship between Paragraph IV litigation characteristics and the probability of a Paragraph IV settlement. Examining Paragraph IV settlements from 2003 to 2020, we find that the number of patents being litigated and the years of remaining market exclusivity are the strongest predictors of settlement. Moreover, we find no statistically significant relationship between active ingredient patents and settlement. This information may be helpful to regulators intending to promote the goals of the Hatch-Waxman Act.",2023,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1
Media coverage and patent trolls: A study on US high-tech firms,Media; NPE litigation; Patent trolls; Anti-troll law; LITIGATION; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; RESPONSES; EQUITY; PRESS,"This paper investigates the impact of media coverage on a nonpracticing entity (NPE) patent litigation concerning the defendant firms. Using a sample of high-tech and patent-intensive firms from the US market between 2000 and 2020, we find that NPEs tend to target highly visible firms. This result is more pronounced when the firms are large and experience positive sentiment in the market. We ensure the causality of this relationship using the anti-troll law, which is targeted to curb the threat of NPE trolls, as a natural experiment and distance from the nearest news branch as an instrumental variable. We find that after suing the target firms, the return of the plaintiff, or the NPE firm, increases. Our results provide new insight into the effect of media coverage on firms' litigation environment. & COPY; 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2023,Business & Economics,1
How Does Firms' Innovation Disclosure Affect Their Banking Relationships?,innovation disclosure; credit markets; patenting; private information; FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION; PROPRIETARY INFORMATION; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PATENT PUBLICATION; CREDIT; PROTECTION; CHOICE; IMPACT; TRADE; PRODUCTIVITY,"Firms face a trade-off between patenting, thereby disclosing innovation, and secrecy. We show that this trade-off interacts with firms' financing choices. As a shock to innovation disclosure, we study the American Inventor's Protection Act that made firms' patent applications public 18 months after filing, rather than when granted. We find that such increased innovation disclosure helps firms switch lenders, resulting in lower cost of debt, and facilitates their access to syndicated-loan and public capital markets. Our evidence lends support to the idea that public-information provision through patents and private information in financial relationships are substitutes, and that innovation disclosure makes credit markets more contestable.",2021,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,1

However, the growing frequency for patent infringement lawsuits significantly impacts the corporate innovation. The existing literature focuses on the direct relationship between patent infringement litigation and corporate innovation without exploring the mechanisms. Based on this, this paper analyzed the effect between patent infringement litigation and innovation and heterogeneity using a fixed effects model on the theoretical model basis. The study found that patent infringement litigation has a positive impact on innovation investment; patent infringement litigation promotes innovative activity through foreign direct investment; executive team risk appetite negatively moderates the relationship between patent infringement litigation and firms' innovation investment. Patent infringement litigation has a more significant incentive effect on the innovation activities of state-owned enterprises, more open regions, and in the northeast and east regions. This paper not only reveals the mechanism that judicial litigation affects innovation activities but also provides a reference basis to solve patent disputes.",2024,Business & Economics,1

The course consisted of six units that covered a wide variety of topics including an overview of the patent system and the importance of patents in a knowledge economy, career options for chemistry students in the patent field, the process for getting a patent, how to read and understand chemical patents, developing a patentable idea, ethics and biotechnology patents, drug patents, and public policy issues. A diverse range of chemical innovations were analyzed, including fragrances, pharmaceuticals, nicotine chewing gum, hair dyes, toner compositions, vaping formulations, and pesticides.

We concentrate on psychiatric conditions since these pose unique challenges. We analyze two public policies that potentially encourage the development of systems for remote monitoring of intake, namely the granting of patents and marketing authorization, and identify key stakeholders and their main interests so as to discuss whether these policies provide disproportionate benefits to some. The stakeholders identified are patients, system providers, drug manufacturers, insurers or healthcare systems, physicians, data users, and society at large. We discuss relevant industry reports, regulatory data, patent documents, and academic literature, and argue that there is concern that the drivers for these tracking systems are revenue and the monitoring of 'compliance' rather than 'adherence'. While accepting that the use of these systems can be justified in some circumstances, in our view these systems pose risks to patient autonomy, Shared Decision-Making, and privacy. We also find that policies on granting patents and marketing authorization overly favor the commercial actors and put patients' interests at risk. Accordingly, we propose that additional safeguards are required.",2022,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,1
The Divisional Game: Using Procedural Rights to Impede Generic/Biosimilar Market Entry,Divisional patent applications; Procedural rights; Pharmaceutical patents; Double patenting; PATENTS,"Despite being used frequently by practitioners in a wide array of technical fields, divisional patent applications (divisionals) seldom attract scholarly attention. The lack of scholarly attention is an error, particularly in the pharmaceutical field. Recent case law in the UK reveals that after generic/biosimilar manufacturers successfully revoke patents standing in the way of market entry, divisionals claiming protection for similar subject-matter as the patent that has just been revoked can crop up, hindering generic/biosimilar medicines from entering the market. Moreover, right before or after proceedings start, rightsholders de-designate countries to avoid a negative judgment that may affect a court elsewhere, meaning generic/biosimilar manufacturers initiated legal proceedings for nothing. Such practices demonstrate that divisionals deserve our attention. This article thus fills the scholarly gap by showing how divisionals are (mis)used in practice, before arguing that patent reform is necessary to prevent this from occurring.",2022,Government & Law,1
Spatial Interactions and the Commercialisation of Academic Patents: The Chinese Experience,Commercialisation of academic patents; spatial spillover; research funding; university-industry interactions; China; BAYH-DOLE ACT; UNIVERSITY-RESEARCH; RESEARCHERS; SCIENCE; PUBLICATION; COMPETITION; REFORM; IMPACT; LINKS,"Studies on academic patent commercialisation are well documented. However, spatial effects are seldom considered, which could lead to potentially misleading analytical results. This study addresses this concern by applying the spatial analysis method to investigate how university-level factors and commercialising academic patents are related. Using a comprehensive dataset of university patents from 1815 Chinese universities in 2016, we find that public research funding of universities, industrial research funding, the number of scientific research personnel, the number of monographs published, and the number of awarded achievements are positively related to the commercialisation of academic patents. However, the number of teaching and research personnel and the number of academic papers published are negatively related. There are positive spatial spillover effects in commercialising academic patents among neighbouring universities, but there will be negative spatial spillover effects in funding competition.",2022,Business & Economics,1
The Effect of TRIPS Implementation on Indian Patent Law: A Pharmaceutical Industry Perspective: With Special Reference to Healthcare Industry,Pharmaceutical; Patent Law; IPR; Healthcare Industry; Legal Scenario and Policies; ,"The Pharmaceutical Policy, 2002 of the Government of India emphasized upon diluting drug price control by suggesting criteria for price control that will reduce the basket of price control to a bunch of irrelevant or so drugs. The kinds of drugs that would be left under price control are mostly irrelevant to public health. The World Trade Organization (WTO) enacted the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to provide reasonable standards of protection for each of its Member Countries. The TRIPS Agreement is a basic standards agreement that gives Members the option to offer more comprehensive intellectual property protection if they so choose. Members are free to choose how to apply the Agreement's provisions in accordance with their respective legal framework and practices. Since India joined the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the country's patent system has experienced substantial modifications. Product patent protection was made mandatory for developing nations in 1995. The TRIPS Agreement establishes basic requirements for patent protection, and when it was put into effect, the economic businesses underwent a significant transformation. Since its creation, the World Trade Organization's (WTO) member countries' intellectual property (IP) regime has changed and modified.

Patent eligibility after Alice: Evidence from USPTO patent examination,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; MARKET; INNOVATION; OFFICE; IMPACT,"In a series of decisions over the last decade, the Supreme Court of the United States altered the classes of inventions that are eligible for patent protection-a body of law called subject matter eligibility. One of the more contentious of these decisions, Alice Corp. versus CLS Bank International (Alice), questioned the patentability of a broad class of inventions involving abstract ideas, particularly in digital technologies. Exploiting a quasinatural experiment, we find that the Alice decision reduced favorable patent eligibility decisions by 31% and significantly and persistently increased legal uncertainty in patent examination by 26% for a broad set of technologies. Our analysis quantifies how legal decisions can limit patent protection and highlights the need for further research on how greater legal uncertainty affects upstream investments supporting invention and downstream innovations fueling growth.",2024,Business & Economics,1

To overcome this difficulty, we obtain data on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We predict and find that perceived information asymmetry between managers and outsiders resulting from both proprietary and agency costs triggers FOIA search. We categorize organizations making FOIA requests using their business descriptions and find that many, including law and intellectual property firms, are not expressly interested in obtaining information for near-term equity trading. Instead, their search activity relates to determinants beyond financial characteristics, including patent litigation and executive turnover. Taken together, we provide evidence on private information search by a relatively unexamined set of organizations and shed new light on the function of the SEC's Office of FOIA Services.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Do main paths reflect technological trajectories? Applying main path analysis to the semiconductor manufacturing industry,Social networks; Patents; Technological trajectories; Semiconductor manufacturing industry; Moore's law; CITATION NETWORK,"It has been proposed that main path analysis can be used to identify technological trajectories in patent-citation networks. In this paper, the method is applied to a network composed of one million US patents and eight million citations in order to trace the backbone of the technological trajectory of the semiconductor manufacturing industry. An in depth discussion of the method is presented, focusing on the many parameters that can be adjusted while applying it and on the consequences of adjusting any of them. Moreover, and differently from other papers on the subject, the result of the algorithm is analysed to determine if it indeed represents the most important technological contributions to the trajectory or if it is merely a collection of relevant and connected patents. This is made easier by the fact that the semiconductor industry has a clear and widely known technological trajectory that spans more than 50 years, Moore's law.",2021,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,1

In this article, we employ a recent change to U.S. patent law-the introduction of an elective program accelerating patent examination-to investigate the role of patent examination speed in strategic entrepreneurship. We find that small firms with limited patent portfolios are the most likely to expedite their patent applications. Moreover, accelerated patents are cited and litigated at higher rates than other patents, and these outcomes are more sensitive to exogenous changes to patent scope. Our results suggest that providing the option to accelerate patent examination may help increase incentives for innovation by strategic entrepreneurs. Managerial Summary Patents are essential to high-tech businesses, helping them to secure funding and exclude competitors from the marketplace. We evaluate a USPTO pilot program that allowed patent applicants to accelerate patent examination, yielding a patent in less than 1 year when typically 3 or more years are required. We find that entrepreneurs are more likely to use the program than large firms. Moreover, patents examined under the program tend to be strategically important. They are litigated and cited at higher rates than other patents, and the scope of the patents' claims plays a key role in these outcomes. Collectively our results suggest that multi-track patent examination programs are likely to have a positive effect on generating new ideas, increasing value capture for entrepreneurs, and facilitating the growth of small businesses. Our results also suggest that the USPTO has implemented the program successfully by accelerating examination without sacrificing quality.",2021,Business & Economics,1

Here, to address this imbalance, we specifically identify and characterize the patent portfolios of NPEs registered as dormant companies in the UK and investigate whether they are created for the purpose of acquiring valuable IP assets or launching litigation campaigns. Our econometric analysis - based on more than two hundred NPEs registered as dormant companies in 2019 - supports the second hypothesis. Finally, as an illustrative example of how small NPEs use UK dormant companies to acquire and litigate patents in Europe, we describe the business model of Dragon Green Development Balboa SA, an entity incorporated in the Republic of Panama that controls thirteen UK dormant companies and which is involved in fourteen patent litigation cases in Germany.",2021,Business & Economics; Public Administration,1

This study analyzes how Indonesia addresses the social function of intellectual property and government intervention in mitigating the pandemic. This study shows that outside the patent waiver provisions, implementation is the key. Indonesian Government has set a strategic framework in accordance with the guidelines of the WHO by simultaneously takes two strategies of vaccine provision and procurement: First, purchasing vaccines from abroad and/or collaborating with national and/or international institutions, Second, the development of 'Vaksin Merah Putih' (Red and White Vaccine) independently in the country through a triple helgix synergy involving the government institutions/ministries, universities, and industries.

The anti-monopoly regulation of reverse payment patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical industry in China*,Reverse payment patent settlement agreements (RPPSAs); patented drugs; generic drugs; competition law; ,"In recent years, the legality of reverse payment patent settlement agreements (RPPSAs) in the pharmaceutical industry has become a contentious issue and attracted the attention of antitrust authorities in many countries. It is a sophisticated intersection of patent protection - encouraging research and development in the pharmaceutical industry - and competition enforcement - maintaining fair and effective competition in the relevant market. Given the complexities, there is no unanimous approach adopted to deal with the compatibility of such RPPSAs with antitrust law. As China's legal and economic context has changed considerably, there will be great possibility that such RPPSAs will also appear in China. However, there has not been an effective anti-monopoly analysis framework established that focuses on regulating such RPPSAs in China. Therefore, this article proposes that China should prepare itself in advance from two perspectives. On the one hand, a competition inquiry should be conducted in China's pharmaceutical industry to evaluate the development of RPPSAs; on the other hand, a basic analysis approach should be confirmed in the forthcoming anti-monopoly guidelines for intellectual property rights (IPRs). This article proposes that the anti-monopoly scrutiny should mainly focus on the patent settlement agreements with value transfer from a brand-name drug company to a generic one in exchange for the latter's commitment to delay market entry. Then, China's Anti-monopoly Law should be applied differently on the basis of the timing at which the generic drugs are permitted to enter the market. Finally, this article provides some important and typical factors of RPPSAs that should be examined carefully.",2020,Government & Law,1

While women's rights to health and life are clearly established in legal instruments, having these laws without the fulfilling them will not serve the people they are meant to safeguard. For this reason, this article argues that the right to health and life includes the right to an effective access to available, good quality, safe and effective medicines that are equally affordable to everyone. Essentially, human rights principles, norms and standards provide strong moral support for the consideration of women's access to medicines, in view of the adverse impact of international and national patent law on public health. It is also submitted that ensuring this access to a choice of essential medicines at an affordable price requires the state to ensure that the granting of patent rights to inventors and pharmaceutical companies does not hinder access to essential drugs. In the same vein, the article argues for the design, interpretation and implementation of patent rights to respond to the right to health, life and access to medicines.",2020,Government & Law,1
India's Traditional Knowledge Digital Library and the Politics of Patent Classifications,India; Patent classification; Patent law; Traditional knowledge; Traditional knowledge digital library; REFORMULATION REGIME; HERITAGE,"This article analyzes India's Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) as a potential intervention in the administration of patent law. The TKDL is a database including a vast body of traditional medical knowledge from India, aiming to prevent the patenting and misappropriation of that knowledge. This article contextualizes the TKDL in relation to documentation theory as well as to existing research on the uses of databases to protect traditional knowledge. It explores the TKDL's potential consequences for India's traditional medical knowledge and the wider implications that traditional knowledge databases can have for the safeguarding of traditional knowledge in general. The article concludes that on the one hand the TKDL bridges the gap between the main branches of Indian traditional medicine and the formal knowledge system of International Patent Classifications. Furthermore, it has also inspired revisions of the International Patent Classification system, which makes it better adapted to incorporate traditional medical knowledge. On the other hand, critical research on traditional knowledge documentation argues that traditional knowledge databases, like the TKDL, can decontextualize the knowledge they catalogue and dispossess its original owners. The TKDL, however, also fits into a national, Indian agenda of documenting and modernizing traditional medicine that predates the formation of the TKDL by several decades and challenges the dichotomy between traditional and scientific knowledge systems that originally motivated the formation of the TKDL.",2023,Government & Law,1

Has China Established a Green Patent System? Implementation of Green Principles in Patent Law,green principles; intellectual property; sustainable development; green patent; TRAGEDY,"The goal of high-quality economic development proposed by China has defined the sustainable development concepts of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing. Changes in economic development strategies affect corresponding changes in the legal system. The green patent system has an important impact on sustainable development. This paper looks for evidence at the system level from the three aspects of patent application protection, patent licensing and patent infringement relief, and proves the penetration of the green principle in the patent system, which is mainly reflected in the following points: (1) in terms of patent application, concrete public interest clauses, exclusion of non-green technologies from patentable objects, and open green channels for green technology patent applications to speed up examination; (2) in terms of patent licensing, exploration of the application of compulsory patent licensing to green patents for environmental protection, and improvement of patent open licensing to encourage the open sharing of green patents; (3) in terms of patent infringement remedies, the introduction of the green principle at an appropriate time to limit the right to stop infringement claims, and the application of punitive damages for intentional infringement and serious damage to the ecological environment. The conclusion is that China is currently working to establish a green patent framework, but the specific details have yet to be perfected, and the impact of legislative changes on green technology development remains to be seen. The above steps have gradually established the preliminary structure of green patents.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Modeling an indicator for statutory patent novelty,Patent novelty; Patentability; Patent rejection; Examination prosecution; Deep learning; Data-driven theorizing; TECHNOLOGICAL NOVELTY; INNOVATION; PRIMER,"Novelty is considered a conditio sine qua non for the grant of a patent by most relevant patent authorities and in U. S. patent law defined by 35 U S C. 102. Previous attempts to operationalize patent novelty have been mostly based on theoretical principles, such as recombination theory, and have not estimated novelty according to data that officially determines whether sufficient novelty is present in an application. To overcome this gap, this study analyzes whether established measures of patent novelty are capable of predicting the rejection of an application based on lack of novelty. Furthermore, this study applies a combination of sophisticated unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to patent data and provides the possibility to estimate statutory novelty practiced by the USPTO by a modeled indicator. Measuring such statutory novelty would give applicants a tremendous competitive advantage to pursue patent strategies offensively and/or defensively. For example, the indicator allows companies - particularly small and medium-sized companies with limited resources - to assess the novelty and therefore the patentability of one's own invention. Large companies, most of which are more likely to pursue an offensive patent strategy, can use the indicator to measure the novelty of numerous published third -party patents and challenge their validity.",2024,Information Science & Library Science,1

It focuses on unraveling the intricate web of influences that steer patenting and transformation within 34 universities in this region. The study reveals the spatial spillover of university patent applications and delves into the nuanced choices universities make in transforming patents. The findings underscore the antecedents of university patent applications and reveal their propensity for spatial spillovers across the region. Key determinants, in particular the government funding and the economic prosperity of the region in which the university is located, do not positively affect university patent applications. Interestingly, institutional distance can assist colleges in the region in generating more patents. Moreover, the study delineates two central pathways for patent transformation within universities: one involves the strategic allocation of internal resources, while the other depends on collaborative ventures between universities and their respective regional ecosystems. This dual approach illuminates viable pathways for the evolution of university patents and provides insights into leveraging internal dynamics and fostering collaborative networks with the broader regional innovation milieu.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Academic spill-ins or spill-outs? Examining knowledge spillovers of university patents,; BAYH-DOLE ACT; LIFE SCIENCES; INDUSTRY; TECHNOLOGY; US; CITATIONS; GROWTH; EXPERIENCE; INNOVATION; GEOGRAPHY,"In this article, we investigate whether academic technology-based knowledge crosses university boundaries or remains trapped inside the ivory tower. To do so, we rely on a matched sample approach to compare the spillovers generated by academic and firm patents using measures that take into account knowledge spilling-in and knowledge spilling-out of academia. Although it is true that knowledge exchanges among universities may inflate the overall spillovers of university patents vis-a-vis firm patents, our results indicate that university patents generate more spillovers than a comparable sample of matched corporate patents, even when knowledge flows among universities are not regarded as spillovers. This suggests that, in our sample, firm technologies more frequently rely on academic patents than on technologies from other corporations. In addition, we find that the gap between university and industry spillovers differs across industries, with industries where patents are important for appropriating returns from R&D (i.e. more economically valuable), such as drugs, presenting a smaller gap than in industries with complex technologies (where firms have strong incentives to patent aggressively), such as computers. Finally, we show that industry patents generate more spillovers locally and that academic knowledge spillovers are less geographically localized than those of corporate research.",2020,Business & Economics,1
TYING LAW FOR THE DIGITAL AGE,; CHICAGO SCHOOL; ANTITRUST; ARRANGEMENTS; MONOPOLY; POLICY,"Tying arrangements, a central concern of antitrust policy since the early days of the Sherman and Clayton Acts, have come into renewed focus with respect to the practices of dominant technology companies. Unfortunately, tying law's doctrinal structure is a self-contradictory and incoherent wreck. A conventional view holds that this mess is due to errant Supreme Court precedents, never fully corrected, that expressed hostility to tying based on faulty economic understanding. That is only part of the story. Examination of tying law's origins and development shows that tying doctrine was built on a now -dated paradigm of what constitutes a tying arrangement. In its origins during the industrial age, tying meant the leverage of patent rights over one good to impose requirements contracts forcing the purchase of a second, unpatented good. That paradigm no longer describes the vast majority of tying arrangements challenged under the antitrust laws. Instead, digital -age tying claims tend to involve product design decisions, the integration of technologies, the bundling of components, considerations of product functionality and performance, and the economic terms on which companies can obtain a return on their research and development investments. Correcting the mess in tying law requires not only updating economic learning, but also appreciating the patterns of behavior to which standards are",2024,Government & Law,1

This paper examines the evolution and dynamics of international patenting networks (IPNs) using data on cross-border patent grants from the World Intellectual Property Organization database. Employing social network analysis and a quadratic assignment procedure (QAP), the study analyzes IPNs from 1995 to 2020. The findings reveal a significant globalization of patents, with a shift in the centers of gravity for outward-bound international patenting from the West to the East. The IPNs exhibit a small-world phenomenon, illustrating the interconnectedness and efficiency of patent flows globally. Asian countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, have gained increasing importance in patenting activities, reflecting the evolving landscape of economic globalization. However, a few countries still dominate worldwide patent activity, leading to an asymmetrical international patent relationship between high-income (HI) countries and non-HI countries. Developed countries serve as expanders, while developing countries primarily act as absorbers of patented technologies. QAP analysis indicates that trade, institutional, language, and technological proximities were all found to contribute to the formation of outward-bound IPNs, while political and economic proximities had varying effects. Surprisingly, geographical proximity exhibits a counterintuitive positive effect. These findings provide important implications for international economic policy.",2024,Engineering; Business & Economics,1

It is pity that the majority of patentees are R&D workers who specializes in developing new technology, but have rare understanding about patent maintenance and how to exercise patent right, not to mention how to maximize the patent value, including transference of patent right, patent licensing, patent financing and other options about patent entitlement. Most of local high-tech companies in Taiwan are original equipment manufacturers (OEM) or original design manufacturers (ODM), therefore, they are not available to drive continuous innovative research and development for patent with large capital to obtain competitive advantage by patent right and seize the opportunity to maximize the patent value, which is the method international original brand manufacturers (OBM) adopted. In the framework of trust of Patent Act, this study adopts comparative research methodology to analyze trust of patent becomes the dilemma and potential opportunity when maximizing the patent value. Eventually, the study have some findings: 1. Patent term for pharmaceuticals is longer than that for other inventions, and that's why the competitiveness of trust of patent for pharmaceuticals is better than the trust of other inventions' patent. 2. The objective way to measure the value of patent right might depends on the evaluation purpose. After calculating individual patent value, then transforming the different types of intellectual properties into the various trust equities categorized by the patent evaluation purposes, and trust equities might be an option when making decision for investors. Briefly speaking, taking advantage of the characteristic of patent and working with financial system to make trust of patent have much more market-based incentives would make the trust of patent as an opportunity rather than a dilemma for maximizing the patent value.",2021,Government & Law,1
Patent protection: does it promote or inhibit the patented technological knowledge diffusion?,Technological knowledge diffusion; Patent protection; Patent lifetime; Patent claim; INNOVATION; CITATION; INFORMATION; FLOWS; LIFE,"Patents not only promote the dissemination of technological knowledge through the disclosure of innovative information, but restrict the use of patented technology by the public within the scope of the law. With this exclusive protection on the premise of information disclosure, it is ambiguous whether patents help or hinder the diffusion of knowledge within the span of patents. This study first constructs a multidimensional index of patented technological knowledge diffusion (PTKD) from spatiotemporal aspects, and compares the differences in technological knowledge diffusion of four types of patents-valid patent (VP), zero-cited patent before expiration (Z-B), zero-cited patent after expiration (Z-A), and non-zero-cited patent before and after expiration (NZ-BA). Then, the impact of patent protection-patent lifetime (PL), the number of independent claims (NIC), the number of words in the first independent claim (NWF)-on the degree of PTKD is explored. The results demonstrate that NZ-BA has the highest level of PTKD in terms of growth rate, technological and geographical breadth and depth, followed by VP. Meanwhile, PL affects the diffusion growth rate and technological and geographical breadth negatively, NIC positively affects the diffusion average speed and technological and geographical depth while NWF only positively affects the technological depth of diffusion. These findings highlight the role of different types of patents in promoting technological innovation and promote a better understanding of the correlation between patent protection and PTKD, which provides support for decision-makers to protect property protection and guides the patentees to protect their long-term economic and technological benefits.",2022,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,1

Towards a More Orderly Application of Proportionality to Patent Injunctions in the European Union,Proportionality; Injunctive relief; Permanent injunctions; Abuse of rights; Equity; Patent assertion entities; Complex products; HOLDUP,"The intensity of IP protection has traditionally been determined by assessing the criteria that need to be satisfied for the protection to be granted, as well as the scope of rights and limitations of those rights. The enforcement stage and the remedies available to right holders have for long been, if not neglected, then certainly treated with lesser attention. The rise of aggressive litigation strategies, especially in the field of patents, has brought the enforcement stage to the forefront of the discussion about the proper level of IP protection in general and patent law in particular. Injunctions provide particularly strong leverage at the enforcement stage, allowing patentees in some cases to obtain royalties that exceed the value of the protected inventions. The principle of proportionality can play an important role as a check on excessive litigation strategies by patentees. Flexibility, however, comes at the price of uncertainty and unpredictability as to the outcome of patent disputes. Therefore, it is crucial to apply proportionality in an orderly and structured manner. For that purpose, the article identifies a set of factors that may be helpful in applying proportionality in patent disputes. That set of factors is well grounded in the traditions of the laws of the EU Member States.",2022,Government & Law,1

Leveraging intellectual property: The value of harmonized enforcement regimes,Intellectual property rights; Debt financing; Legal enforcement; Financing constraints; PATENT PROTECTION; CAPITAL STRUCTURE; MARKET; RIGHTS; INNOVATION; CONSTRAINTS; COMPETITION; QUALITY; GROWTH; CRISES,"This paper examines the role of intellectual property (IP) law as a determinant for external debt financing of innovative firms. For identification, we exploit exogenous variation in patent right enforcement arising from the 2004 EU Enforcement Directive. This major policy reform strengthened IP rights and, thus, raised patent owners' asset position. We find that patenting firms significantly increase their use of debt and benefit from lower interest rates in response to the amendment, especially if they own valuable patent portfolios. These effects are most pronounced for relatively small and financially constrained firms, emphasizing the importance of the legal framework in fostering debt financing activities of innovation -oriented firms.",2024,Business & Economics,1
The role of registering trademarks on firms' innovation: Evidence from Chinese firms,; ,"Firms are used to registering trademarks for intellectual property protection which ultimately increases their innovations. Using a novel data set tracking firm-level trademark registrations of Chinese listed firms between 2005 and 2017, this article sheds light on the role of a firm's first trademark in its patents and the related provision's implication in the developing world. We implement a difference-in-difference model to find approximately a 30% increase in the number of a firm's patents after its first trademark application. Moreover, we take advantage of the latest amendment of China's Trademark Law in 2013 as an exogenous shock to investigate the influence of law protection on trademark-induced innovations. The results suggest a strengthened effect of first trademark applications on patent numbers after the 2013 amendment.",2023,Business & Economics,1

We find that 37.0% of the patents granted at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) have been involved in a form of monetization. Among them, 29.7% have been licensed out, 5.9% have been reassigned to other universities, National Laboratories, federal agencies or non-profit entities, and 1.3% have been transferred to companies. We investigate the patent characteristics associated with each monetization channel (i.e., licensing and outright sale). We also introduce a set of survival model analyses to control for the dynamic nature of the monetization process. The transacted inventions in the portfolio (and, in particular, the licensed ones) are peculiar over several dimensions: they show higher value or technical merit, higher legal robustness, and higher complexity. Licensed patents differ from reassigned ones especially for a higher technological complexity. Patents transferred to companies are not frequent in the university core fields, but the corresponding market for technology is able to select those with higher value and legal robustness.",2020,Business & Economics; Public Administration,1
Should Pay for Delay Be a Cause for Concern in Japan?,Pay for delay; Japan; pharmaceutical; US antitrust; competition; comparative analysis; theory of harm; Japanese Antimonopoly Act; Europe; patent settlement; SETTLEMENTS; ACTAVIS,"Yes, it should. Pay for delay settlements have raised concern across the globe and have led to significant competition law scrutiny in the US and Europe. Branded pharmaceutical companies use patent settlements to pay potential generic entrants in order to stay off the market, thereby reducing competition and harming consumers. This conduct has been found to be unlawful by the US Supreme Court and the EU General Court. In Japan, however, such anticompetitive settlements allegedly do not take place, despite offering similar economic incentives to pharmaceutical companies in the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world. This is intriguing and warrants close scrutiny. This article is the first to investigate, based on a comparative analysis with the US and EU whether or not the Japanese pharmaceutical sector is susceptible to pay for delay settlements. We come to the conclusion that the regulatory regime in Japan features the necessary prerequisites to make pay for delay settlements a feasible yet anticompetitive drug lifecycle management strategy.",2020,Government & Law,1
"Learning by Selling, Knowledge Spillovers, and Patents",; DEVELOPMENT COMPETITION; STRATEGIC EXPERIMENTATION; INNOVATION; PERSISTENCE; DYNAMICS; ENTRY,"We examine the incentives for experimentation in the context of innovation and market competition. A monopolist chooses whether to sell early-stage product or perform costly scale-up R & D. Early market participation facilitates learning about demand but invites knowledge spillovers and competitors, while R & D acts as a barrier to entry. The firm's optimal policy can exhibit both under- and over-experimentation vis-a-vis the socially optimal policy. Patents can control the pace of innovation and restore efficient experimentation. When the surplus from R & D is large, rewarding early-stage innovation encourages market experimentation and limits wasteful R & D investment.

We exploit the variation in pharmaceutical liability and litigation rules across firms in the pharmaceutical industry and countries to explain the firm-level propensity to patent. Drawing on a large dataset from European Patent Office (EPO) covering over 9,950 pharmaceutical patents from 63 countries over the period 1991-2015, we compute the conditional probabilities of individual pharmaceutical firms to acquire a valid-based patent on the validation outcomes and examine whether different liability regimes encourage or deter firm-level propensity to patent. Our empirical strategy addresses firm-level idiosyncrasies, country-level unobserved effects, and common technology shocks that potentially invoke omitted variable bias in the effects of liability regimes on the propensity to patent. Our investigation reveals that liability regimes combined with damage caps, broad statutory excuses, and reversed burden of proof have a strong positive effect on the firm-level patent stock and a negative effect upon EPO patent validation rate. The evidence suggests that not all liability rules and related litigation procedures are created equal. Firms are systematically more likely to hold (firm-level patent stock) valid patents at the EPO when the liability and litigation rules are not complex and when the damage cap, broad statutory excuses, and reversed burden of proof are introduced.",2021,Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Fences or stacks: theoretical considerations regarding references in patents,; CITATION ANALYSIS; SCIENCE; LINKAGE,"Introduction Patent citations are an important indicator for studying science and technology interaction. Yet, empirical and conceptual studies of referencing practices in patents are largely lacking, which has resulted in an under-theorised understanding of patent citations. Theoretical approach This study analyses previous research on patent citations and discusses these in relation to citation theories developed within science studies and bibliometrics. The ambition is, however, to advance beyond a comparative approach by adding an additional layer of analysis in which the overarching rhetorical function of references in patents and papers is considered. Conceptual Analysis The analysis shows how referencing in patents have distinguishing characteristics in terms of who cites, the temporality of referencing, national and international context, quantity of references, and incentives for citing. These characteristics are discussed using the concept of fencing and stacking. Fencing illustrates how references in patents are used to demarcate claims, while the stacking of references in scientific papers is an act of cumulative persuasion. Conclusions Substantial rhetorical and epistemological differences exist in how references are used in patents and papers, and these differences have implications for how citations patterns can be interpreted. The conceptualisation of referencing as fencing and stacking is suggested as a possible framework for interpreting empirical studies of patent citations. Overall, it is argued that a further theoretical, and empirical, understanding of referencing practices in patents are need in order to contextualise and problematise patent citations, and their current use in research and policy.",2022,Information Science & Library Science,1

We find that lenders construct stricter contracts for firms filing more patents, consistent with lenders imposing more oversight on firms when they enter the commercialization stage after having demonstrated their inventiveness. Our results hold under propensity score matching and entropy balancing, and when exploiting the American Inventors Protection Act as a shock affecting unrelated banks' access to patent filing information. The relationship we document is stronger when the lender has more expertise and for firms with higher default risk. We demonstrate that borrowers' patent filings are associated with more future R&D and capital investment and with a higher likelihood of their acquiring firms in the industry of their patent filings. Our results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that lenders interpret patent filings as indicative of high inventive potential that requires stricter discipline and oversight by lenders in order to be converted into actual business success, and with them designing debt contract terms accordingly.",2024,Business & Economics,1
"R&D, patents, and financing constraints of the top global innovative firms",Financing constraints; Firm innovation; Patents; R&D; PANEL-DATA; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS; CASH FLOW; EQUITY; SENSITIVITY; PROTECTION; SIGNALS; IMPACT,"Highly innovative firms face unique financing constraints because there is often a greater degree of information asymmetry between firms and potential lenders. Prior literature indicates that patents provide a quality signal to external investors that potentially help mitigate internal liquidity constraints. In this paper, we study the joint impact of firms' patent stocks and operating profit margin, which acts as a proxy for internal funds, on R&D expenditures in a panel of the top 20 0 0 corporate R&D performers worldwide. We find that patenting activity lessens the impact of negative internal liquidity shocks on innovation for relatively smaller firms. In contrast, patenting activity does not have an attenuating effect for relatively larger firms. The results are consistent for high and medium-high technology firms and are robust to country specific controls.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Unilateral Acquisition and the Requirements of Freedom: A Kantian Account of the Judicial Exceptions to Patent Protection,; ,"For obscure reasons, courts exclude some statutorily patentable inventions ('judicial exceptions') from patent protection. These exclusions have been criticized for impeding innovation, contrary to the purpose of patent law. I argue that freedom requires these exclusions even if they impede innovation. Patents, like property, can be unilaterally acquired, limiting others' freedom without their consent. Kant explains why, to reconcile property with equal freedom, only rivalrous objects in acquirers' first possession can be unilaterally acquired. States can rightfully authorize unilateral acquisition of only these objects. Drawing from Kant, I explain how patent protection conflicts with equal freedom unless patented inventions involve inventive uses of rivalrous objects external to human bodies. Enabled by inventive concepts, these uses would be impossible without these concepts, and are thus in the first possession of their inventors. I then show how the most recent United States Supreme Court judicial exception decisions limit patent protection to inventive uses of rivalrous external objects.",2022,Government & Law,1

As firms' exposure to cybersecurity risk increases, managers' reliance on trade secrets declines, as they seek to protect their firms' intellectual capital under the umbrella provided by patent and intellectual property laws. In particular, we document that firms exposed to cyber threats file for simpler patents to accelerate their innovation cycle. This strategic adjustment is not costless, as it causes firms' returns to research and development (R & D) investments to decline significantly.",2023,Business & Economics,1

The development and diffusion of PT is influenced by space and network. Analyzing China's patent transfer network (PTN) from 2001 to 2020 through spatial and complex network analysis, we found that the PTN became denser with significant Matthew effect, hierarchical and small-world properties. Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen remained as national hubs, while new hubs like Suzhou, Guangzhou, Foshan, and Hangzhou, acting as intermediates, emerged. Network communities become more homogenised and geographically clustered due to the resonance effect. There was a shift from disperse hubs to spatial agglomerations, with the construction of long-distance shortcuts breaking spatial constraints on intercity patent transfer.",2024,Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Does Productive Mean Active? The Behavior of Occasional and Serial Academic Inventors in Patenting Processes,academic inventors; academic patenting; inventive productivity; inventor behavior; patent process; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; TRIPLE-HELIX; SCIENTIFIC-KNOWLEDGE; INNOVATION; COMMERCIALIZATION; UNIVERSITIES; EUROPE; ENTREPRENEURS; MANAGEMENT; PUBLICATION,"Previous literature has attributed differences in individuals' inventive productivity to a range of environmental, organizational and individual traits. However, the behavior of individuals with different inventive productivity has not been empirically explored in detail. Based on interviews with twenty Swedish academic inventors of diverse patenting experience, this paper analyses how serial and occasional inventors acted in patent initiation, patent application and subsequent patent management for specific inventions. Two modes of behavior are identified: passive and active. Individuals' inventive productivity was not aligned with behavioral mode, with both modes of behavior exhibited by occasional as well as serial academic inventors. Individual academic inventors also varied in mode of behavior across different patent processes. These findings suggest that commonly used volume-based classifications of academic inventors obscure potentially relevant behavioral differences. This insight has implications for contemporary policy and organizational practice. It also highlights the need for further investigation of when academic inventors assume an active or passive mode of behavior in processes of academic commercialization.",2021,Business & Economics,1

We propose a nationwide empirical investigation of patented academic inventions in France over nearly two decades which offers a number of results that are either new, or confirm previous insights on a much larger dataset. We find that the direct contribution of academia to the nation's flow of patented inventions is revised upwards, up to eleven percent of all patented inventions. We also show that patenting behavior is more pervasive in the academic community than expected with one in five professors or researchers having invented at least one patent in nearly all fields of hard and life sciences. Even if academic patenting was strong before the 1999 reform favoring technology transfer, the propensity of professors and researchers to invent has significantly increased over the subsequent period. Though age plays positively on patenting, more recent cohorts of faculty members are not more likely to patent so that individual factors cannot fully explain the increasing propensity to patent. Lastly, we examine social and cultural factors (e.g. peer effects and local diffusion of behavioral practices), in particular within labs, which are found to be important drivers of the spread of patenting in the academic community.",2022,Engineering; Business & Economics,1
Chorzow Factory - intellectual property and the continuity of international law in investor-state dispute settlement,Chorzow Factory; investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS); patent expropriation; reparation standard; international law; ,"One of the most important cases in the jurisprudence of international law - Chorzow Factory - has a hidden secret, so much so that, even when in plain sight, legal post-mortems of the case fail to mention this well-kept secret. Chorzow Factory was about intellectual property rights, specifically patents and trade secrets, and this narrative has never been fully addressed. When the developments in international investment law and arbitration are fully considered it is worth looking back at Chorzow Factory to associate it with new streams of contemporary investor-state disputes that include issues such as intellectual property rights. Because Chorzow Factory has established the full reparation standard for unlawful expropriation, the standard has enabled a continuity of international law and underscores its importance for contemporary investment arbitration. However, the intellectual property narrative of Chorzow Factory has been neglected, and, in this article, I want to develop the intellectual property narrative of Chorzow Factory and to demonstrate the nexus between fair compensation, intellectual property rights and the continuity of international law.",2020,Government & Law,1
Use of patent term extensions to restore regulatory time for medical devices in the United States,The drug price competition and patent term restoration act; market exclusivity; patent; patent term extension; patent term restoration; PTE; PMA; LONGER PATENTS,"BackgroundMedical devices can seek patent term extensions (PTEs), which extend market exclusivity to compensate for delays related to clinical trials and regulatory review. Pharmaceutical companies commonly use PTEs, but their use by medical device companies has not been clear.Research Design and MethodsWe examined the use of PTEs by medical device companies between 1984 and 2024 using a database published in the Federal Register and a list published by the Patent and Trademark Office.ResultsOnly 178 medical device submissions were linked to a PTE application. They were mostly concentrated in 116 product codes associated with 15 medical specialties; nearly half were associated with cardiovascular devices. Numbers increased significantly in the past decade. Successful applications restored 987 days on average.ConclusionsThe patent restoration opportunity appears underutilized. It is unclear whether some companies do not recognize the opportunity it promises, or whether it does not meet their needs. Different business features and marketing strategies in device versus pharmaceutical industries may decrease the usefulness of the PTE program for these types of medical products. However, the finding that a small subset of manufacturers operating in competitive markets adopted patent extension strategies more commonly suggests a significant competitive advantage when competition increases.",2024,Engineering,1
Patenting Strategies on Inhaler Delivery Devices,antitrust law; asthma; COPD; Food and Drug Administration; inhalers; patents; ,"BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma and COPD rely on inhalers to control symptoms. Yet, these products remain expensive, in part because brand-name manufacturers have obtained numerous patents on inhalers, including on their delivery devices. Recent antitrust litigation has raised questions about the boundaries of listing device patents with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), particularly when patents do not claim any active ingredients. RESEARCH QUESTION: How have manufacturers relied on device patents to preserve market exclusivity on brand-name inhalers? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified patents on brand-name inhalers approved for asthma and COPD between 1986 and 2020 using the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). We extracted information about patents from LexisNexis TotalPatent One and Google Patents and searched device patents for mention of active ingredients or other prespecified features linking the patent to the relevant drug. For each inhaler, we determined the duration of protection added by device patents. RESULTS: The FDA approved 53 brand-name inhalers for asthma and COPD from 1986 through 2020, 39 of which had at least one device patent. One hundred thirty-seven distinct device patents were in the final cohort, representing 49% of all patents listed on inhalers. Seventy-seven percent of device patents made no mention of active ingredients or their molecular structures, and 72% made no mention of any relevant prespecified feature connecting the device patent to the drug product. For the 39 brand-name inhalers with one or more device patents listed in the Orange Book, device patents extended the duration of market protection by a median of 5.5 years (interquartile range, 0.0-10.5 years) beyond the last-to-expire nondevice patent. INTERPRETATION: Patent and regulatory reform is needed to promote generic competition and to ensure that patients with asthma and COPD have access to affordable medications.",2023,General & Internal Medicine; Respiratory System,1

Key characteristics are that patent citations are aggregated by patent family, and that not all citations are considered equal. To each family citation a weight is assigned that is proportional to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the countries in which protection is requested, to take into account the costs and expected benefits of patenting, and inversely proportional to the number of cited references in a patent family, as a way to correct for differences in citation frequencies in patent applications among technological fields. Around one third of journals indexed in Scopus have at least one citation from patent applications in a 5-year citation window. The distribution of the technological impact scores among journals can be modelled as a power law distribution, with the slope being a little smoother than that of common scientific impact indicators SJR and JIF.

An overview of patents on therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in Europe: are they a hurdle to biosimilar market entry?,Intellectual property strategies; patents; biopharmaceutical market; monoclonal antibodies; biosimilars; ,"As patents on many high-selling biological medicines are expiring, non-innovator versions, such as biosimilars, may enter this multi-billion dollar market. This study aims to map patents and patent applications for innovator as well as biosimilar monoclonal antibodies in Europe, and investigates legal challenges associated with patenting the innovator product and alleged infringing activities, focusing on consequences for biosimilar developers. Via an exploratory literature review in PubMed and a database analysis in Darts-ip, Derwent Innovation, and Espacenet, an overview of basic patents and exclusivity rights for some of the best-selling biologicals is given, supplemented with a detailed analysis of patents taken during the medicine's life cycle via three specific case studies (trastuzumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab). Case law was used to determine which patents were viewed by biosimilar developers as blocking market entry. For the selected monoclonal antibodies, the key protection instruments appeared to be the basic patent and the additional protection provided by a supplementary protection certificate. We observed that additional patents filed after the basic patent are hard to obtain and often insufficient in blocking market entry of biosimilars, but can in some cases be a substantial hurdle for biosimilar developers to overcome in patent litigation cases or to invent around, creating uncertainty on the launch date of a biosimilar on the market. These hurdles, however, seem to be surmountable, given that many cases were won by biosimilar developers. Also, biosimilars can be protected by filing new patents and these mainly pertain to new formulations.",2020,Research & Experimental Medicine,1
Patent citation network analysis: A perspective from descriptive statistics and ERGMs,; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; GRAPH; INNOVATION; MODELS; GEOGRAPHY; MOBILITY; COUNTS; SPREAD; GROWTH,"Patent Citation Analysis has been gaining considerable traction over the past few decades. In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references' references) together with the technicalities of the patents (e.g., language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1

Based on data from 2006 to 2015, we find moral hazard between government and innovative Brazilian companies, as there was no express incentive in the Lei do Bem to stimulate the industrial sector to innovate and register the innovation as a patent. Thus, policies that review the tax incentives structure contained in the Lei do Bem as well as encourage industries and companies to file patents in public patent databases may have positive effects on the Brazilian innovation system.",2021,Business & Economics,1
The anti-suit injunctions in patent litigation in China: what role for judicial self-restraint?,; ,"center dot Starting from 2020, the Chinese courts have actively participated in the jurisdictional battles for the standard essential patent (SEP) disputes, a pivotal development marked by the Supreme People's Court's inaugural SEP-related anti-suit injunction (ASI) in Huawei v Conversant. Subsequently, lower courts in China have emulated this approach by issuing ASIs targeting SEPs in the domain of information and communication technology. center dot The present study highlights the features of the Chinese 'act preservation measures' by comparing them with the typical ASIs originally developed in the common law jurisdictions. This comparison reveals significant divergence in the factors considered by Chinese courts issuing ASIs, particularly in the context of cross-border patent litigation. The study aims at elucidating potential defenses that the respondents in SEP litigation may employ to contest the issuance of ASIs in Chinese judicial proceedings, with particular attention accorded to the principles of comity and public interest. center dot The article concludes that the invocation of international comity and public interest in SEP litigation will encounter a formalistic assessment by the Chinese judiciary due to potential conflicts with statutory provisions and the lack of a more context-specific analysis. As a result, in the absence of supra-national mechanisms that would address the problem of parallel litigation, there appears to be little room for judicial self-restraint.",2024,Government & Law,1
Patents as Vehicles of Social and Moral Concerns: The Case of Johnson & Johnson Disposable Feminine Hygiene Products (1925-2012),patents; concerns; feminine hygiene products; health; environment; ,"This paper is about disposability as a technological concern and about how to trace the related issues through the analysis of patents. It examines how moral and social concerns happened to be embedded (or not) in technology, based on the case of disposable feminine hygiene products. The focus is placed on what disposable means and on exploring relative notions as well as their dynamic and consequences. To conduct such analysis, the paper proposes to perform a classic and computer-assisted analysis of the patents published by Johnson & Johnson over almost a century (1925-2012). Tracing social and moral concerns in patents challenges the existing literature in law, which tends to envision patents as legal assets deprived of moral considerations. The paper shows how hygiene products addressed women, how these products were made disposable, and how what disposability means evolved, both in the heart of technology and in the wider space of concerned markets.",2021,Social Issues,1

We assess important determinants of innovation such as property rights (including enforcement of intellectual property rights), human resources within R&D and high-technology exports. Regarding intellectual property rights, while most previous research focuses on patent strength (de jure or book law), we focus on de facto patent enforcement. Using data from the World Bank, the Heritage Foundation and a new patent enforcement index, we construct a panel of fifty countries covering 1998-2017. Our analysis reveals important new insights including the strongly negative impact of patent enforcement and human resources within R&D on less innovative economies, and the varying impacts across quantiles for key variables such as high-technology exports. We find that both stronger institutions and patent enforcement are not necessarily the best route to boosting innovation, especially in economies where existing innovative capacity is weak",2022,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,1

HOW NON-PRODUCT-SPECIFIC MANUFACTURING PATENTS BLOCK BIOSIMILARS,; ,"A new class of drugs called biologics has potential to finally cure previously untreatable conditions such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. But there is a catch: these innovative drugs are expensive. On average, prices range from $10,000 to $30,000 per year, and the most expensive ones exceed $500,000. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) was passed in 2010 to lower prices by providing a new regulatory pathway in approving biosimilars-copies of brand-name biologics. Yet, the BPCIA's promised regulation of drug prices has not materialized partly due to brand-name companies' vast patent portfolios, also known as patent thickets. This Note analyzed all BPCIA patents disputed in BPCIA litigations and found that over half of the asserted patents are manufacturing method patents, many of which were filed years after FDA approval. Given the nonproduct-specific nature of these patents and stringent FDA requirements, these inventions are not only unnecessary, but are also unlikely to be practiced when producing brand-name biologics. Regardless of their actual worth, these patents are extremely valuable to brand-name manufacturers because even a patent of marginal improvement can foreclose biosimilar access entirely. This Note proposes that brand-name manufacturers should be required to disclose related patents at the time of the FDA approval and share the FDA license application with biosimilar manufacturers. Further, Congress should eliminate the availability of injunctive remedies for these problematic assertions of patents.",2022,Government & Law,1
Regeneron and Illumina: a case for (and against) ranges,patents; claim construction; ranges; relevance of ranges; Illumina; Regeneron; biotechnological inventions; validity; sufficiency; ,"Insufficiency in patents, especially in emerging and complex technologies, can be a real problem for patent applicants. They are keen to progress to filing for obvious reasons and yet are expected to disclose how the invention works to its fullest extent. Problems arise in cases where a patent claim seeks to reserve a range of some sort. Recent judgments of the English Patents Court and the UK Supreme Court have suggested that this is not a trivial problem in most cases of analysis. The upshot appears to be that a range patent is not to be struck down as insufficient simply because a range exists. Much depends upon the importance of the range to the claim or, in the Illumina case, whether mention or the existence of a range is in any way relevant. An analysis of two recent judgments in the UK concerning sufficiency of disclosure sheds considerable light on the current ambit of legal thinking in this area of patent law.",2021,Government & Law,1

Methodologically, the scientific method and the technique of documentary research close to legal hermeneutics were made. By way of conclusion, everything indicates that there is no mandatory administrative procedure for resolving authorship disputes in the patent dispute chamber in Russia. In addition, it was revealed that the provisions of Part 4 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation with respect to the Protection of Non-Property Personal Patent and Intellectual Rights were unsuccessfully established and created legal uncertainty, as only part of the above methods of civil and personal rights have worked in non-property litigation.

SPC squatting,; ,"Supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) for pharmaceutical products are an important complement to patent protection which is often inadequate in commercial terms. SPCs are designed to ensure that originators can amortize their high investments in research and clinical trials. But unlike in the USA, for example, the European SPC is not simply a patent term extension. Rather, it is a unique form of intellectual property right whose subject matter is not the overall patented invention, but the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients of a patented and authorized pharmaceutical product. This link between the basic patent and market authorization has led to many questions of interpretation and Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) rulings since the SPC Regulation was adopted. An issue that has not yet been decided by the CJEU concerns the discrepancy between the ownership of the patent and the marketing authorisation under pharmaceutical law. This scenario, in which a patent proprietor relies on the marketing authorisation of a third party (possibly even a competitor) in said patent proprietor's application for an SPC, is also referred to as SPC squatting. The following article discusses the admissibility of such a practice de lege lata, which also becomes relevant in light of current reform efforts by the legislator.",2024,Government & Law,1
Patent pools and innovation-based approach in global healthcare crisis,essential patents; healthcare; incentive theory; IP & jurisprudence; IP system rationale; patent pools; pharmaceutical industry; ,"During the COVID 2019 pandemic, the healthcare sector faced major jurisprudential questions about the intellectual property system. During this period, the world was in the midst of a healthcare crisis, wherein the debate between the reward for innovation versus accessibility to all at equitable rates have become intense. In a such challenging scenario, the scientific community were dedicated toward the research while the healthcare industry was indulging in arguments over the incentives on creation. In this paper, the authors, as IP researchers, argue that in a scenario where there is an intense dispute over innovation versus accessibility, probably patent pool can serve as a mechanism to handle the tussle. The authors have analyzed a few patent pool models that were chosen on the basis of the types of patents in the pool. Additionally, an attempt is made to scrutinize the laws governing patent pools in developed countries and developing countries. In doing so, the authors draw the benefits and limitations of the patent pools in healthcare. We follow a qualitative research methodology. The research is based on secondary data and has some limitations because of this.",2023,Government & Law,1
RACE AND SELECTIVE LEGAL MEMORY: REFLECTIONS ON INVENTION OF A SLAVE,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PATENTS; COMMERCIALIZATION; RIGHTS,"In 1858, the United States Attorney General issued an opinion, Invention of a Slave, declaring inventions by African Americans, enslaved and free, unpatentable. Within a few years, legal changes that abolished the law of slavery rendered the opinion obsolete, and it became forgotten, dropped from legal memory. Combining history and Critical Race Theory, this Essay repositions the opinion as a remembered legal story and argues that law's selective memory has carried a cost. I excavate the generations of African American activists who researched and wrote about the opinion and its backstory of an enslaved blacksmith who invented an innovative plow. Setting their storytelling in the context of post-Emancipation advocacy for the rights of belonging, I demonstrate the political stakes of their efforts in the relationship among inventive ability, patents, and citizenship. I reflect on my first encounters with Invention of a Slave as an obscure part of the antebellum past and on the new perspective gained from this history of remembering. I argue that these stakes persist, making this story part of the living present of race and law. I use this personal storytelling to consider the costs of legal forgetting and the possibilities of mitigation both in this case study, with implications for the patent system and our ongoing national conversation about paths to citizenship, and in the broader projects of curating law's memory and fulfilling law's formal promises of racial equality.",2020,Government & Law,1
DIGITALIZATION OF LAW IN THE MODERN WORLD,Legal system; Digitalization of law; Intellectual property; Electronic services; Scientific and technological progress; Patent service; ,"The study aims to investigate the concept, content, and nature of law digitalization processes taking place in the modern world. The paper examines an important direction of research that suggests that real provision of digital human rights calls for a state mechanism for their protection along with the search for an optimal legal compromise between the access of law enforcement services to information and the right of citizens to confidentiality. The study utilizes the method of induction, systemic scientific analysis, and comparative legal and historical methods. The leading method at the basis of solving the research problem is the comparative legal study of the digitalization of law. The paper categorizes and analyzes the processes of law digitalization and the closely related social processes of today, explores (based on the example of digitalization of legal relations on the protection of property rights to intellectual products) legal mechanisms of digitalization of patent services and specialized law firms.

THE COST OF NOVELTY,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ME-TOO DRUGS; PATENTS; INNOVATION; ATORVASTATIN; COMPETITION; RETHINKING; PROTECTION; STANDARDS,"Patent law tries to spur the development of new and better innovative technology. But it focuses much more on new than better-and it turns out that new carries real social costs. I argue that patent law promotes innovation that diverges from existing technology, either a little (what I call differentiating innovation) or a lot (exploring innovation), at the expense of innovation that tells us more about existing technology (deepening innovation). Patent law's focus on newness is unsurprising, and fits within a well-told narrative of innovative diversity accompanied by market selection of the best technologies. Unfortunately, innovative diversity brings not only the potential benefits of technological advances but also the costs: incompatibility between different technologies; a spread-out, shallow pool of knowledge; and the underlying costs of developing parallel technologies that aren't actually better. These costs matter. Biomedical innovation illustrates the high costs of divergence. Although pharmaceuticals are touted as a poster child for patents, the world is rife with me-too drugs that drive up costs with little to show for it. Biomedical innovation often suffers from a particular trap: Patent incentives push innovators toward new, but incentives from Food and Drug Administration approval and insurer reimbursement push innovators toward not too new. In this space, artificially constricted markets do a poor job of selecting better technologies. The result is a proliferation of technologies that are new for the sake of new, giving us the costs of divergence without much in the way of benefits. This Essay presents an original spectrum of innovative divergence, illuminates how various patent doctrines drive divergence, and lays out the substantial costs of divergence through biomedical examples. It analyzes the complex interactions between three different incentives for biomedical innovation and presents policy prescriptions to help avoid the trap of new for the sake of new. In the process, it lays out how innovation scholars and policymakers alike should take into account the cost of novelty.",2020,Government & Law,1

Intellectual property rights in outer space: How can pharmaceutical companies protect COVID-19 vaccine and immunotherapy developments aboard the ISS US national laboratory?,COVID-19 medical innovations; intellectual property rights; ISS National Lab; pharmaceutical companies; space law; space pharmaceuticals; ,"Believing that space pharmaceuticals might be the key to winning the battle against COVID-19, global pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca and Sanofi Pasteur are currently collaborating with the International Space Station National Laboratory (ISS-NL) on research projects aiming to develop vaccine-and-immunotherapy products. The present legal regime for outer space, however, does not provide clear guidelines on safeguarding intellectual property rights (IPRs), due to the difficulties of reconciling the territorial nature of patent law and the nonterritorial nature of space law. Responding to such a legal gap, this research paper argues how pharmaceutical companies can protect such medical innovations by taking into consideration the international principles of space law addressing IPRs and extraterrestrial jurisdiction, as well as the legal regime of the ISS-NL. With the exception of the possibility of the barriers between the two areas of law not being insurmountable, the proposed COVID-19 TRIPS Waiver furthermore impacts space pharmaceuticals' IPRs and commercialization, which leads to the identification of some advantageous forms of agreements, including the Joint Endeavor Agreement, the Space Act Agreement, as well as the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, for pharmaceutical companies defined as agreement partners with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",2023,Government & Law,1
How to Benefit from Balancing External Knowledge Acquisition? A Chinese EIT Industry Case,External knowledge acquisition; Open innovation; Innovation performance; Internal R&D; Patent backward citations; Patent collaboration; Patent purchase; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; OPEN INNOVATION; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; PATENT CITATIONS; MODERATING ROLE; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; RADICAL INNOVATION; TECHNOLOGY; DIVERSITY,"This paper develops an integrated framework and examines how the implicit property-knowledge heterogeneity, acquisition costs and interactivity embedded in external knowledge acquisition (EKA) affect firms' innovation performance. This is done by distinguishing three forms of EKA, including patent backward citations, patent collaboration and patent purchase. This research contributes to the existing EKA and open innovation literatures by studying whether EKA and internal R&D serve as substitutes or complements for firms' innovation performance. Using a sample of 77 publicly listed firms in the electronic and information technology (EIT) industries of mainland China, with panel data collected from 2004 to 2016, this study has reached the following new findings: First, EKA both through patent backward citations and patent collaboration have significantly positive effects on firms' innovation performance; the effect of patent purchase is not significant. Second, EKA through patent backward citations complements firms' internal R&D, but EKA both through patent collaboration and patent purchase act as substitutes for internal R&D. Third, an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between the level of balance among the three different forms of EKA and firms' innovation performance. Finally, contingent interaction effects exist between the level of balance among the three different forms of EKA and internal R&D on firms' innovation performance. A complementary relationship exists with the internal R&D when firms have a high level of balance among three different forms of EKA. However, a substitution relationship exists with the internal R&D when firms have a low level of balance among the three different forms of EKA.",2022,Business & Economics; Public Administration,1
How do patent incentives affect university researchers?,Bayh-Dole; Economic incentives; Employee inventions; Patent; Replication; Universities; BAYH-DOLE ACT; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PUBLIC RESEARCH; FACULTY; COMMERCIALIZATION; INNOVATION; INVENTION; SCIENCE; RIGHTS,"Universities and other beneficiaries of public funding for scientific research are encouraged to patent resulting inventions under the Bayh-Dole Act. This controversial framework gives academic grant recipients a direct financial stake in the success of their inventions by requiring universities to share the resulting patent royalties with inventors. This incentive for grant recipients might help justify Bayh-Dole patents when the conventional justification for exclusivity-that it is necessary for commercialization-fails to hold. But there is little evidence as to whether it works. This article examines how one aspect of the patent incentive-the prospect of royalties-affects the behavior of university researchers. Fortuitously, different schools offer inventors different shares of patent revenue. We have created a dataset of royalty-sharing policies from 152 universities, which shows substantial variation across universities and time. (For example, Caltech switched from sharing 15 %-25 % of net income in 1994, the University of Washington switched from sharing 100 % of initial revenues to a flat rate of 33 % in 2004, and the University of Iowa switched from 25 % to 100 % of initial patent revenues in 2005.) Although prior work has reported that higher inventor royalties lead to more university licensing income, we show that this result was driven by coding errors. We also extend prior work by examining more years, doing a more convincing panel data analysis, using additional outcome variables, and looking at lateral moves by the most active patenters. In all of these analyses we find no compelling empirical evidence that increasing university inventors' royalty share has a significant effect on any of the outcomes one would expect to be most affected. These results do not imply that patents provide no incentives to university researchers. They may provide reputational benefits or encourage faculty-run spin-offs, or even provide financial incentives that are not captured by our statistics. But the lack of a measurable impact of higher royalty shares on patenting activity suggests that, from a social welfare perspective, it may be preferable for a larger share of royalties to be retained by universities, which are then required by Bayh-Dole to reinvest this money in science research and education. In any event, our analysis raises promising questions for future research and calls into question the existing view that increasing the inventor's share in university patent policies encourages researchers to develop and commercialize more remunerative patents.

The real role of AI in patent law debates,artificial intelligence; machine learning; algorithms; automation; inventorship; AI-assisted inventions; prior art searching; essentiality checks; standard essential patents; standards; ,"Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to automate intellectual tasks through systematization, which renders it one of today's most important technologies. Nevertheless, the capabilities of AI have been frequently overestimated. In the field of intellectual property, for instance, it has been debated how to protect 'AI-generated inventions', even though AI cannot invent without human intervention. In the meanwhile, other discussions which have a more direct impact on markets have been set aside. We take a look at two of those discussions in the patent field: (i) how AI can be used as a tool to help patent offices and applicants in evaluating the patentability of their inventions by analysing massive amounts of documents in a shorter timeframe and (ii) the employment of AI to perform essentiality checks, ie, to identify patents that are essential to a standard.",2022,Government & Law,1

The study is divided into two periods, i.e., 1995-2005 and 2006-2015, based on the pre- and post-product patent amendment(1) act, 2005. We employ a negative binomial model with fixed and random effects to estimate the impact of technology purchase over R & D and patenting activity, respectively. The estimates of the R & D equation suggest a complementary relationship between technology purchase and in-house R & D. However, the estimates of the patents equation suggest a substitute relationship between in-house and technology purchase. Further, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between in-house R & D, technology purchase, and patenting activities. However, the interaction between in-house R & D and technology purchase positively moderates the nonlinear relationships. Lastly, our estimated result is sensitive to different industries and periods.",2022,Business & Economics,1

The economic theory of cost-effectiveness thresholds in health: Domestic and international implications,cost‐ effectiveness threshold; external price referencing; market power; ,"Public health insurers often use an implicit or explicit cost-effectiveness threshold to determine which health products and services should be insured. We challenge the convention of a single threshold. For competitively provided products and services, prices are determined by cost; but for products with market power, patentees will increase the price according to the perceived threshold. As a result, a change in the threshold affects the prices of all patented products, including those which would have been developed even at a lower threshold. The insurer can increase efficiency by reducing the threshold for patented products, even accounting for the effect on innovation. We also model a multi-country setting, in which thresholds for patented products will fall below the globally cooperative solution because each country does not recognize the positive externality of its own spending on innovative medicines. We show that this tragedy of the commons problem can be partly corrected through referencing other countries' thresholds, but only when the countries have similar willingness to pay.",2021,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,1

Studying Nonobviousness,; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; PATENT; AGREEMENT; COURT; LAW; EXPERTISE; APPEALS,"Many scholars have observed that an empirical study is only valid to the extent it is reliable. Yet assessments of the reliability of empirical legal studies are rare. The closest most scholarship comes is to compare the results of their studies to those of others. As a result, in many legal fields, including intellectual property law, scholars lack a grounded understanding of how valid or reliable empirical legal studies really are. This Article examines the reliability of empirical studies of judicial decisions by closely comparing two recent studies of the patent law doctrine of nonobviousness. We find these studies provide robust results despite differences in the cases selected to include in each dataset. However, the amount of agreement varied for some data fields more than others. Particularly, there was more inter-study variability for fields that examined judicial reasoning than fields for decision outcomes. This finding provides some validation for the use of macro-level studies of judicial decision-making. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis to directly compare the actual coding (as opposed to just the outcomes) of two different studies examining the same patent law doctrine. Building on the existing data, we also make an original contribution to the literature on nonobviousness by extending the time studied to the present. In contrast with studies examining the immediate period after the Supreme Court's decision in KSR v. Teleflex, we find (1) a substantial decline in the number of 35 U.S.C. & sect; 103 district court cases appealed to the Federal Circuit, (2) a higher rate at which courts deem the patent nonobvious, and (3) a high affirmance rate for district court determinations of both obvious and nonobvious.",2022,Government & Law,1

A Network Theory of Patentability,; LOCAL SEARCH; PATENT; LAW; TECHNOLOGIES; EXPLORATION; CREATIVITY; PSYCHOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; TESTS; TOO,"Patent law is built upon a fundamental premise: only significant inventions receive patent protection while minor improvements remain in the public domain. This premise is indispensable for maintaining an optimal balance between incentivizing new innovation and providing public access to existing innovation. Despite its importance, the doctrine that performs this gatekeeping role nonobviousness has long remained indeterminate and vague. Judicial opinions have struggled to articulate both what makes an invention significant (or nonobvious) and how to measure nonobviousness in specific cases. These difficulties are due in large part to the existence of two clashing theoretical frameworks, cognitive and economic, that have vied for prominence in justifying nonobviousness. Neither framework, however, has generated doctrinal tests that can be easily and consistently applied. This Article draws on a novel approach network theory to answer both the conceptual question (what is a nonobvious invention?) and the measurement question (how do we determine nonobviousness in specific cases?). First, it shows that what is missing in current conceptual definitions of nonobviousness is an underlying theory of innovation. It then supplies this missing piece. Building upon insights from network science, we model innovation as a process of search and recombination of existing knowledge. Distant searches that combine disparate or weakly connected portions of social and information networks tend to produce high-impact, new ideas that open novel innovation trajectories. Distant searches also tend to be costly and risky. In contrast, local searches tend to result in incremental innovation that is more routine, less costly, and less risky. From a network theory perspective, then, the goal of nonobviousness should be to reward, and therefore to incentivize, those risky distant searches and recombinations that produce the most socially significant innovations. By emphasizing factors specific to the structure of innovation namely, the risks and costs of the search and recombination process a network approach complements and deepens current economic understandings of nonobviousness. Second, based on our network theory of innovation, we develop an empirical, algorithmic measure of patentability what we term a patent's network nonobviousness score (NNOS). We harness data from US patent records to calculate the distance between the technical knowledge areas recombined in any given invention (or patent), allowing us to assign each patent a specific NNOS. We propose a doctrinal framework that incorporates an invention's NNOS to nonobviousness determinations both at the examination phase and during patent litigation. Our use of network science to develop a legal algorithm is a methodological innovation in law, with implications for broader debates about computational law. We illustrate how differences in algorithm design can lead to different nonobviousness outcomes, and discuss how to mitigate the negative impact of black box algorithms.",2020,Government & Law,1
AI for Patents: A Novel Yet Effective and Efficient Framework for Patent Analysis,Patents; Task analysis; Technological innovation; Training; Noise measurement; Deep learning; Law; Deep learning; key-sentence extraction; keyword extraction; patent; patent analysis; post training; RETRIEVAL; ART,"Patents provide inventors exclusive rights to their inventions by protecting their intellectual property rights. However, analyzing patent documents generally requires knowledge of various fields, considerable human labor, and expertise. Recent studies to alleviate this problem on patent analysis deal only with the analysis of claims and abstract parts, neglecting the descriptions that contain essential technical cores. Moreover, few studies use a deep learning approach to handle the entire patent analysis process, including preprocessing, summarization, and key-phrase generation. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-stage framework that can aid in analyzing patent documents by using the description part of the patent rather than abstracts or claims with deep learning. The framework comprises two stages: key-sentence extraction and key-phrase generation tasks. These stages are based on the T5 model structure, transformer-based architecture that uses a text-to-text approach. To further improve the framework's performance, we employed two key factors: i) post-training the model with a patent-related raw corpus for encouraging the model's comprehension of the patent domain, and ii) utilizing a text rank algorithm for efficient training based on the priority score of each sentence. We verified that our key-phrase generation method of the framework shows higher performance in both superficial and semantic evaluation than other extraction methods. In addition, we provided the validity and effectiveness of our methods through quantitative and qualitative analysis, demonstrating the practical functionality of our methods. We also provided a practical contribution to the patent analysis by releasing the framework as a demo system.",2022,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,1
"Balancing law, sustainability, and the economy in China's responsible mineral resource extraction path",Mineral extraction industry; Green growth; Green tech imports; Rule of law; Transparency; China; ,"This study assesses the impact of the rule of law, transparency, green economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), innovation, and green technology imports on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from mineral extraction in China (1989-2020). Utilizing data from the China Statistical Yearbook and international databases, it identifies the positive effects of the rule of law and transparency on sustainability in China's mineral extraction. A 1 % increase in these factors corresponds to significant CO2 reductions, indicating the effectiveness of regulations. The green growth index is also associated with positive CO2 reductions. Surprisingly, foreign direct investment (FDI), innovation (patent applications), and a lack of green patents reveal unexpected environmental impacts. Policy recommendations encompass reinforcing legal frameworks, fostering green economic growth, aligning FDI with eco-friendly practices, incentivizing green innovations, and promoting green technology imports to enhance sustainability in China's mineral extraction sector.",2024,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Orthopaedic device innovation in South Africa: A study of patenting activity,social network analysis; patent knowledge development; knowledge exchange; innovation system; NETWORKS; PRODUCTIVITY; SYSTEMS,"We assessed knowledge development and exchange among actors who patent orthopaedic devices in South Africa over the period 2000-2015. A social network analysis was performed on bibliometric data using co-inventorship on patents as an indicator of collaboration between different organisations, with a focus on the spatial and sectoral contexts. Network metrics and innovation system indices are used to describe knowledge development and exchange. The results show that university, healthcare and industry organisations have primarily been responsible for increased patenting over time. The key actors were a set of industry actors - a national actor and its US partner - who have patented many devices jointly. National universities were found to make a small contribution, and science councils were found to be absent, despite the efforts in the changing innovation landscape to encourage publicly financed research organisations to protect their intellectual property. The collaboration networks were found to be sparse and disjointed, with many actors - largely from the private healthcare sector - patenting in isolation. Significance: The considerable number of patents filed by private sector clinicians in orthopaedic device innovation in their personal capacity is highlighted. Few patents emanate from national universities, and science council actors are largely absent, despite the Intellectual Property Rights from Publicly Financed Research and Development Act to protect intellectual property emanating from public research organisations. Patenting networks are more fragmented than are scientific publication networks.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1

In this context, hydrogen fuel cells play an important role in this transition, as they convert the energy stored in hydrogen into electrical energy, acting as a zero-emission technology. Therefore, an analysis of patents is relevant since it is a technology under development. We aim to evaluate the technological development of hydrogen fuel cells through a patent analysis from the Derwent Innovations Index to assess the technological advances between 2001 and 2020. The research strategies returned 22,165 patents and the study shows that: (i) There is a consistent number of patent applications in the period analyzed, which is a reflection of the high rates of research and development for this technology, and the number of patent applications of hydrogen fuel cells had two moments of growth-the first one was between 2001 and 2005, and the second was from 2015 to 2020; (ii) Japan, China, South Korea, and the United States have the highest number of patent applications; (iii) Toyota, Panasonic, Nissan, and Hyundai are the companies with the most patent applications, and the leading technology adopted is the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell; (iv) the main knowledge areas of patents are engineering, electrochemistry, energy fuels, and chemistry; (v) most of the documents are subdivided by the international patent classification into patents for the improvement of technology (H01M8/04), patents for fuel cells using solid polymeric membranes (H01M8/10), and patents for reducing pollution, with a predominance of technologies aligned with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (H01M8/06); and (vi) there is a prominence of deposited patents for polymer electrolyte membrane and solid oxide fuel cells.",2024,Energy & Fuels,1
Patent litigation in Europe: intermediate fee shifting and the UPC,; ,"This writing explores the European understanding of fee shifting rules and how the unitary patent regime addresses fee shifting rules. In European jurisdictions, the IP Enforcement Directive has harmonized some parts of the remedies, even though they are mainly governed by national law. European jurisdictions often apply fee shifting rules, meaning that the losing party pays the winning parties' expenses and fees. However, in most cases, costs are not fully covered. Instead, European jurisdictions use intermediate fee shifting that allows the winning litigant to recover some, but not all, of its litigation expenses. The Unitary Patent Court (UPC) follows intermediate fee shifting. Hence, the UPC may lower or raise the ceiling of the recoverable costs or, upon request, wholly or partially reimburse expenses. For example, the recoverable cost might be disproportionate if the unsuccessful party is a small and medium size company. Like national rules, fee shifting in the unitary patent regime has limitations and discretionary elements, such as proportionality, equity, and partial success. In addition, the UPC will follow the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union related to the interpretation of the IP Enforcement Directive.",2023,Government & Law,1
Easy Is Not Always Good - The Fragmented System for Adjudication of Unitary Trade Marks and Designs,EU trade mark law; EU design law; International jurisdiction; Applicable law; Sanctions for infringement; EUROPEAN PATENT; JURISDICTION; AGREEMENT; COURT,"While the creation and still outstanding implementation of the Unified Patent Jurisdiction system continue to cause contentious debates among academics and practitioners, the system introduced in the early 1990s for adjudication of conflicts concerning unitary trade marks (and, later on, unitary design rights) had the charm of simplicity. Building on the national court systems instead of providing for a genuine EU judiciary, the scheme could easily be fitted into existing structures. On the other hand, the imperfect, limping character of the system creates issues inter alia concerning international jurisdiction and applicable law. Furthermore, attributing jurisdiction in infringement litigation to separate national court hierarchies may jeopardize the coherence of the system. While the prospects for reform may be dim insofar as the system in its entirety is concerned, the detrimental effects of fragmentation could be overcome at least to some extent by creating a unitary catalogue of sanctions.",2021,Government & Law,1
Innovation and Own Prior Art,; PATENTS; PATENTABILITY; IMPROVEMENT; RETHINKING; STANDARDS; INVENTION; PROPERTY,"This Article analyzes a conflict between innovation and the patent system: innovation is a dynamic, iterative process, but a patent reflects only a single snapshot in time. Despite extensive scholarly and judicial discussion of when an invention is ready for patenting, there is rarely a perfect time to file a patent application. Instead of filing a single perfect application, companies and others engaged in innovation typically build a portfolio of patents by filing a series of applications over the course of research and development. Yet this is an imperfect strategy because each patent application sets up a potential barrier for an innovator's future applications. The barrier arises because future applications must be both new and nonobvious as compared to most of the innovator's existing patent applications. This Article examines the interaction between patent applicants' own earlier-filed applications and patentability requirements. This interaction shapes how innovators seek patent rights, and it affects disclosure and innovation. Despite its significance, the legal treatment of successive patent filings by the same innovator developed haphazardly. The resulting statutory framework, built by the layering of various provisions, is not well-tailored to the original policy goals. Moreover, in its current form, the law has unintended effects that can hamper innovation. This Article proposes a statutory amendment that would provide a better mechanism for directly tailoring the statutory framework, and it illustrates how its parameters can be adjusted to reflect the balancing of competing concerns.",2021,Government & Law,1
"Research, patents, and IPO valuation under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002",; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MARKET REACTION; IMPACT; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; INVESTMENT; MANAGEMENT; EARNINGS; TERM,"Research and development (R&D) investments and patents influence initial public offering (IPO) valuations. After Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) legislation was enacted in 2002, there was a shift from a display of 'Effort' to 'Results'. SOX legislation made fundamental changes to corporate accounting practices and the process of going public. We investigated how the IPO market responded to SOX legislation. Compliance with SOX was disproportionately costly for small, research-intensive firms. Using Signaling Theory, we focused on whether the existence of patents became a valuable signal for the effectiveness of research and development expenditures (R&D). Our findings indicated decreased importance of R&D expenditures (signaling 'effort' to innovate). We also found increased importance of patents (intermediate 'results' of R&D efforts) post- relative to pre-SOX. We concluded that patent activity at least partially replaced and moderated R&D in its role as a value driver of IPOs in the post-SOX environment.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Balancing act: Navigating the tensions between patenting practices and open science in Chilean academic research,Patenting; Open science; Academic research; UNIVERSITY; SECRECY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; TECHNOLOGY; SCIENTISTS; DISCLOSURE; PROPERTY; DYNAMICS; GENETICS; PROGRESS,"This study aims to understand the relationship between academic patenting and secrecy in three key areas: the delay in publishing patentable results, the refusal of requests for research outcomes, and the perception of patent clarity drafting. Based on a dataset of Chilean university researchers, we conduct logistic regression models to understand the propensity to delay the publishing of patentable results, the probability of denying requests for research outcomes, and the likelihood of researchers perceiving their patents as clearly drafted. Controls used relate to the seniority of the researcher, the scientific field, whether the university is private or public, and whether the researcher previously worked with industry. Additionally, some constructs reflecting the researcher's perception regarding the patenting system within academic research were obtained through exploratory factor analysis and then incorporated as controls. The analysis reveals a positive correlation between prior patenting experience and publication delay. However, we found no correlation between previous patenting and the propensity to reject requests for research results. Both behaviors were negatively correlated to researcher seniority, gauged by the h-index, and positively correlated to forestry and agricultural technology sciences activity. Researchers who experienced denial of their requests were more likely to reciprocate refusal. Notably, a negative perception of the patent system within academic research was associated with a belief in drafting clearer patents. These findings suggest an environment of selective openness in academic networks, with researchers balancing full disclosure and secrecy. The paper studies three dimensions of secrecy in academic patenting through the novel data set. This study deepens our understanding of academic patenting practices, uncovering some complex dynamics shaping knowledge diffusion within universities.",2024,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Antisuit injunctions in SEP disputes and the recent EU's WTO/TRIPS case against China,FRAND; patents; standard essential patents antisuit injunction; TRIPS; WTO; SUIT INJUNCTIONS,"The existence of standard essential patents (SEPs)-and the associated litigation-has potentially disruptive consequences for the manufacture, marketing and distribution of complex products that incorporate many patented standards, for example, information and communication technology (ICT) products such as smartphones that incorporate a camera, video, web browser, wireless communications, text messaging, and so on, as well as an increasing number of 'connected' Internet of Things products such as wearable devices and 'smart home' devices. Indeed, SEP owners may use the patent enforcement system to prevent implementers of these technologies from bringing to market competing products that use the same standards. As is known, this raises concerns about competition in the market and the need to maintain interoperability to ensure the development of the ICT industry. One of the legal tools which can be used by implementers to (try to) neutralise SEP holders' anticompetitive behaviours is the 'antisuit injunction' (ASI). ASIs are not uncommon in common law jurisdictions while they are foreign to civil law countries within the European Union (EU). ASIs are particularly useful to SEP implementers when patent holders disrespect their commitment to license their patents on a FRAND basis. For example, a judge who is in the process of assessing whether the SEP owner complies with FRAND terms may at the same time grant an ASI to stop the patentee taking patent infringement actions in other jurisdictions until the FRAND litigation has been concluded. In February 2022, the EU filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization (WTO), arguing that China's use of ASIs prevents EU-based companies from properly protecting their SEPs. Indeed, ASIs have recently been granted in several Chinese disputes, including in Huawei v Conversant and Xiaomi v. InterDigital. More specifically, China's Supreme People's Court held that Chinese courts can use ASIs to prevent SEP owners from filing disputes in any foreign courts to enforce their patents; and that anyone who does not comply with the injunction should be fined euro130,000 per day. In the WTO case the EU notes that such a case law jeopardises innovation and growth in Europe, 'effectively depriving European technology companies of the possibility to exercise and enforce the rights that give them a technological edge'. From a legal perspective, according to the EU, China's conduct is in violation of various Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) provisions, including Article 28 which grants exclusive rights to patent owners. The paper focuses on this EU-China WTO/TRIPS dispute and more generally, on the relevance of ASIs within SEP cases.",2023,Government & Law,1
Commercial Law Intersections,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; SECURITY INTERESTS; ARTICLE 9; GOVERNANCE; CONTRACTS; COPYRIGHT; PRIORITY; ACT; FRAGMENTATION; COMPETITION,"Commercial law is not a single, monolithic entity. It has grown into a dense thicket of subject-specific branches that govern a broad range of transactions and corporate actions. When one of such dealings or activities falls concurrently within the purview of two or more of these commercial law branches-such as corporate law, intellectual property law, secured transactions law, conduct and prudential regulation-an overlap materializes. We refer to this legal phenomenon as a commercial law intersection (CLI). CLIs are ubiquitous. Notable examples include traditional commercial transactions, such as bank loans secured by shares, supply chain financing, or patent cross-licensing agreements, as well as nascent FinTech arrangements, such as blockchain-based initial coin offerings and other dealings in digital tokens. CLIs present a multi-faceted challenge. The unharmonious convergence of commercial law branches generates failures in coordination that both increase transaction costs and distort incentives for market participants. Crucially, in the most severe cases, this affliction deters business actors from entering into the affected transactions altogether. The cries of scholars, judges, and practitioners lamenting these issues have grown ever louder; yet methodical, comprehensive solutions remain elusive. This Article endeavors to fill this void. First, it provides a comprehensive analysis of CLIs and the dynamics that give rise to coordination failures. Drawing from systems theory and jurisprudence, it then identifies the deficiencies of the most common approaches used to reconcile tensions between commercial law branches, before advancing the concepts of legal coherence and unity of purpose as the key to addressing such shortcomings. Finally, leveraging these insights, it formulates a normative blueprint, comprising a two-step method which aims to assist lawmakers, regulators, and courts in untangling the Gordian knot created by CLI coordination failures.",2021,Government & Law,1
"Intellectual property rights, enforcement costs and EU competition law",Competition law; Intellectual property rights; Article 101 TFEU; Article 102 TFEU; Refusal to supply; Reverse payment agreements; FRAND terms; ,"Cases in the intellectual property rights (IPR)-Competition Law intersection have raised the issue of costs of enforcement of IPRs when dealing with the assessment of whether competition law has been breached. Importantly, a systematic underestimation of enforcement costs may be problematic for the protection of underlying investments behind intellectual property as well as obstruct the cooperation between an IPR holder and its licensees, in particular as regards patent rights. Cases on reverse payments indicate that payments by a patent holder to a generic manufacturer under a settlement agreement may well be legitimate in order avoid enforcement costs while not restricting competition. The hard stance on no-challenge clauses and termination clauses under the technology transfer block exemption regulation (TTBER) can destabilize the relation between two parties that would benefit from increased certainty when cooperating to commercialize new technology. In cases regarding the failure of parties to agree on fair and reasonable and non-discriminatory-licensing of standard essential patents, a correct approach has probably been taken in Huawei. However, it is doubtful to what extent the judgment is based upon a balancing exercise that explicitly factors in enforcements cost. Accordingly, it is argued that the current framework of analysis of cases in the intersection is inadequate to proper assess enforcement costs of IPRs.",2023,Government & Law,1

Such uncertainty increases the complexity of ownership decisions in target firms. Drawing from signaling theory, we articulate how international acquirers perceive the pre-emptive power of target firms' patent portfolio as a positive signal, increasing their confidence in target firms' technology and leading them to seek a higher level of equity. We further argue that the strength of the target firm's home country's patent system also acts as a positive signal that encourages investors to acquire a higher level of equity in cross-border acquisitions. However, it also weakens then impact of the pre-emptive power signal. Our findings have implications for scholars, policymakers, and managers.",2023,Business & Economics,1

In this context, green hydrogen, which can be obtained through water electrolysis, is considered one of the main alternatives to enable the replacement of fossil energy sources, acting as an energy vector to balance supply and demand for renewable energy. This study aims to mapping trends in direct seawater electrolysis technology by analyzing patents retrieved from the Derwent Innovations Index database between 1963 and 2022. As a result, 138 patent documents were identified and the analysis revealed an increase in patenting between 2016 and 2021 leading by China, South Korea, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

"Pharmaceutical Patents, Innovation, and the Right to Health",Right to Health; Pharmaceutical Patents; Covid-19; Pandemic; TRIPS; ,"There have been rapid strides in developing laws related to pharmaceutical patents in recent years at the global level. The scope of patentability of pharmaceutical patents has increased and has been codified under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The adoption of the TRIPS Agreement resulted in significant changes to the laws related to patents for developing countries, which are the ers of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The developed nations have contended that patents in the medical field are essential for the promotion of research and innovation. They believe that only a strict patent protection regime catalyzes the development of better medicines and techniques. However, this often results in excessive patenting and monopoly over certain drugs. This drives the prices of the drugs up and makes them inaccessible to a large section of the population, particularly in developing and least-developed countries (LDC's). The scenario regarding vaccine-related patents during the Covid-19 Pandemic was grim since profits were prioritized over people's Health. The pharmaceutical companies were inclined to secure profits and protect their research from being used elsewhere. This amplifies the debate between the protection of Intellectual Property Rights and the Right to the Health of people. The developed countries have contended that the exceptions provided under TRIPS are sufficient to safeguard the health rights of the general populace in developing and LDC's. However, the experiences of the developing countries with the implementation of the exceptions to the TRIPS have yet to be fruitful, with developed countries repeatedly pressuring them into protecting patents at the expense of the Health of their citizens. Geopolitical tensions could further aggravate this. This is evidenced by the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West, which stares at a situation in which Western Pharmaceutical Companies can deny it access to medicines. The unavailability of modern medicine can adversely impact the Human Rights of its citizens in such a scenario. The tensions between different nations can flare over anytime, and the rigid application of TRIPS can be catastrophic to the health rights of the citizens. The article analyses the exceptions under TRIPS and their Effectiveness in protecting the Right to Health. It also suggests modification in the existing Intellectual Property Regime related to pharmaceutical patents to ensure that the Right to Health is not compromised.",2023,Government & Law,1
The Collapse of Alice's Wonderland: Mayo's Faulty Two-Step Framework and a Possible Solution to Patent-Eligibility Jurisprudence,; ,"In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Supreme Court established a two-step framework to determine whether a supposed invention that involves a natural law can be a patent-eligible subject matter. Two years later, the Supreme Court extended this framework in Alice Corp. v.

Recent cases demonstrate that this framework has collapsed from a two-step inquiry into a one-step inquiry, leading to bizarre results and legal uncertainty. This Note examines why the Mayo framework should never have been extended to abstract ideas in Alice, and proposes a solution to determine patent eligibility under 35 U.S.C. 101.",2023,Government & Law,1

Interpretational Dilemma on Divisional Patent Applications in India,patent application; divisional patent application; division of patent application; Indian patent law; ,"A patent grants a limited monopoly to the patent applicant in lieu of disclosing his invention to the public. The scope of protection available to a patent applicant is decided entirely based on the claims of the patent, and hence, what is being claimed forms a critical aspect of the strategy. Further, a patent application may disclose different embodiments of the same invention and/or distinct inventions having different inventive concepts. Ideally, claims could be included for both the different embodiments and the distinct inventions. However, sometimes, due to business considerations or huge costs incurred by including additional claims, patent applicants may claim only some of the different embodiments and/or distinct inventions. During the examination stage, the Controller of Patents may raise an objection in the event he opines that the claims of the patent application relate to multiple distinct inventions, with the remedy under Section 16(1) being available to divide the patent application (now referred as parent application) into one or more further applications during the pendency of the parent application. However, is there a remedy available to the patent applicant if he desires to voluntarily divide his parent application to cover any embodiment/distinct invention that was not claimed in the parent application? Using the doctrinal method, the paper analyses the language of Section 16(1) by applying rules of interpretation, and while additionally taking into account the legislative intent behind Section 16, ascertains whether the true import of the said section, as it stands today, is actually what has been decided by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) or if the language of Section 16 does provide some leeway to the patent applicants to file voluntary divisional applications for any matter that has been merely disclosed in the parent application and not claimed.",2022,Government & Law,1

Unintended consequences of punishment: Adverse effects of environmental penalties on green patents,Green innovation; Environmental penalties; Environmental regulatory risk; CLEAN-AIR ACT; INNOVATION; REGULATIONS; POLLUTION,"We find that manufacturing firms that have received high environmental penalties experience significant declines in subsequent green patenting activity. We further use a difference-indifferences strategy exploiting the passage of 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment (1990 CAAA) as a shock to environmental regulatory stringency and show that the increase in regulatory stringency is linked to decreases in corporate green innovation. The adverse effect of environmental penalties on green innovation is stronger in firms with greater business uncertainty, higher product market competition, higher institutional ownership, and weaker financial conditions. Overall, the empirical evidence is consistent with the view that environmental penalties prompt firms to manage their risk exposure by reducing green innovation activity.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Artificial intelligence and patents in Brazil: Overview on patentability and comparative study on patent filings,Artificial intelligence; Industrial property indicators; Patents; Intellectual property; ,"Innovations related to artificial intelligence (AI) can impact many technological fields and gather attention of several sectors from industry. Brazil is a developing country with a large territory and consumer market, attracting investment from foreign companies, including AI technologies. In the present work, we carry out a review of the Brazilian IP Law, Guidelines and Resolutions regarding patentability of AI inventions in Brazil, and also perform comparative analyses with the guidelines from the EPO and USPTO. Then, patent searches are carried out to analyze filing indicators of patent applications for AI inventions, wherein it is possible to verify that most of the filing applicants in Brazil are foreign companies, mainly from the US. Brazilian entities, which rank second overall in filing for patent applications in Brazil, do not even appear among the main applicants for AI inventions. We conclude that Brazil is not a competitive country in the production of patents related to AI, and it is important for Brazil to establish some degree of legal certainty regarding patent protection for AI inventions and disseminate knowledge about protecting such inventions by patents, so that inventors opt to disclose their AI inventions instead of keeping them as a trade secret. Therefore, more and more sectors of society might benefit from innovations arising from AI.",2023,Information Science & Library Science,1

To do so, we combine a unique United States Patent and Trademark Office historical patent dataset on immigrants who arrived as adults with Census data and exploit exogenous variation in both immigration flows and diversity induced by former settlements, WWI, and the 1920s Immigration Acts. We find that co-ethnic networks play an important role in attracting immigrant inventors. Yet, we also find that immigrant diversity acts as an additional significant pull factor. This is mainly due to externalities that foster immigrant inventors' productivity.",2022,Business & Economics,1

Hand mules continued in use for the spinning of finer yarns, and developed into machines that were hand controlled rather than hand powered. They were built in considerable numbers until the 1860s and some machines continued in use after 1900. Other persons invented self-acting mules but the only one to achieve any success was that by James Smith of Deanston, examples of which were built in small numbers until at least the 1860s. Refinements enabled the self-actor to replace hand mules after the 1860s, but they continued to incorporate the inventions of Roberts.

Diversification of procedural and administrative costs and innovation: Some firm-level evidence,Patents; Intellectual property rights; Patent stock; Diversification of procedural and adminis-trative cost; PATENT PROTECTION; MATRIX ESTIMATOR; GROWTH; PANEL; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; DETERMINANTS; QUALITY; MODELS; RIGHTS; RULES,"We examine the diversification of administrative and procedural costs on patent stock using a large dataset from the European Patent Office with 15,000 firms for the period between 1995 and 2015. The results reveal that administrative and procedural costs are significant for firm-level patenting activity. However, not all administrative and procedural costs have equal effects. Higher administrative costs often encourage patent application and validation by solving the adverse selection problem and short-run opportunism, as well as other sources of asymmetric information. The effective administration of intellectual property law and low-cost enforcement are found to considerably foster patenting activity. The effects are robust for various mis-specification checks and do not disappear once country-level research and development infrastructure proxies are controlled for. The extreme bounds of administrative and procedural costs are computed across more than 5 billion regressions, and the sizeable impact of administration on patent application and validation outcomes is confirmed.(c) 2021 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

Impact of academic patenting on scientific publication quality at the project level,Academic publishing; patenting; project management; research grant; Japan; BAYH-DOLE ACT; UNIVERSITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP; SCIENCE; JAPANESE; COLLABORATION; RESEARCHERS; CREATIVITY; KNOWLEDGE; BEHAVIOR; DATABASE,"This paper investigates the relationship between patenting and publishing at the project level. It uses Japan's Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research database. Japan's Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research is the major funding source for academic researchers in Japan. This database provides information on inputs (budget, period, project members, etc.) and outputs (publications and patents) from each funded research project. The main finding is that patenting has a curvilinear correlation with higher impact, i.e. the number of higher impact publications from funded research projects increases with the number of patents only to a certain amount, and after a peak, it decreases. Our finding implies that if a finding is a relatively significant and marketable breakthrough, researchers who have the possibility of patenting in mind become less likely to share their results openly. Meanwhile, previous studies implicitly assumed that researchers have to make a choice between basic or applied research projects, or for a particular research project choose to make it more applied or basic. Another finding of this study is that the assumption applies to projects. Our findings imply that a heavy emphasis on patenting may reduce the amount of high-quality publishing of scientific research.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Method of TFN-TOPSIS Based on Possibility Degree Relation Model and Its Application in the Patent Value Estimation of Self-Balancing Vehicles,possibility degree relation model; TFN-TOPSIS model; patent value estimating; multi-attribute decision-making; DECISION-MAKING,"With the advancement of technology and the development of intelligence, self-balancing scooters have gradually developed in the field of short-distance travel and have become a fashionable, popular and leisure means of transportation. In addition, both the export of self-balancing scooters and their safety are closely related to their core patents. Therefore, in order to promote the healthy development of the self-balancing automobile industry, this paper carries out the following research: First, we introduce the background of the self-balancing automobile patent and the research status of patent value evaluation at home and abroad. Then, considering the fuzziness of decision makers' thinking and the uncertainty of patent indicators, this paper extends the traditional TOPSIS method to the field of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs), and proposes a TFN-TOPSIS multi-criteria decision model based on the possibility degree relationship model. In addition, this study establishes a core patent value system using three aspects of technology, law and economy, and applies the TFN-TOPSIS model to the top 20 balanced car patents with the highest comprehensive evaluation to rank and analyze the measurement results. On this basis, this paper provides reference opinions for relevant industry personnel from the aspects of future product technology updates and patent layouts.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
The status of patenting plants in the Global South,developing countries; Global South; patents; plants; seed; PATENTABILITY; TECHNOLOGY; PROTECTION; GENE,"Over the last few decades, the number of patents on plants and plant parts has greatly increased in various parts of the world. Most research, however, has focused exclusively on developed countries-the United States and European Union states in particular-while little is known about the extent to which plants are being patented in other parts of the world. This article aims to fill this information gap by providing an overview of the status of patenting plants in the developing countries and emerging economies of the Global South. The research is based on the analysis of legal provisions, patentability guidelines, court decisions (where they exist) and a sample of patents granted in the countries selected for this study. The findings indicate that despite the flexibilities of the World Trade Organization Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement regarding the nonpatentability of plants, 60% of the 126 countries in the Global South for which data were available to allow for the patenting of plants or parts thereof, and many such patents have been identified. This situation warrants further reflection and, potentially, review of existing patent laws as developing countries search for ways of responding optimally to the needs of feeding a growing population while adapting to the challenges of climate change.",2020,Government & Law,1
Environmental protection tax and enterprises' green technology innovation: Evidence from China,Environmental protection tax; Green innovation; Patent quantity; Patent quality; ,"The Environmental Protection Tax Law was officially implemented, marking the initial establishment of China's green tax system. This paper aims to estimate whether the introduction of environmental protection tax will promote enterprises' green technology innovation. Based on data from listed enterprises from 2015 to 2021, this paper takes the implementation of environmental protection tax in 2018 as a quasi-natural experiment, and uses the DID method to evaluate the impact of the implementation of environmental protection tax on the technological innovation ability of enterprises. The results show that, after the implementation of environmental protection tax, the quantity of green patents increased significantly, while the quality of green patents decreased significantly. The analysis of mechanism channel reveals that environmental protection tax policy appears to increase the number of green patents putting regulatory pressure on enterprises and increasing R&D investment, while managerial myopia inhibits the improvement of green patent quality. The changes in the quantity and quality of green patents in large enterprises are more significant. It is also found that the quantity in coastal areas decreased significantly, while the quantity in inland areas markedly increased.",2024,Business & Economics,1
How patent rights affect university science,; BAYH-DOLE ACT; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; QUALITY; ECONOMICS; MOBILITY; FACULTY; PARTICIPATION; INVENTION,"How do intellectual property rights influence academic science? We investigate the consequences of the introduction of software patents in the United States on the publications of university researchers in the field of computer science. Difference-in-difference estimations reveal that software scientists at US universities produced fewer publications (both in terms of quantity and quality) than their European counterparts after patent rights for software inventions were introduced. We then introduce a theoretical model that accounts for substitution and complementarity between patenting and publishing as well as for the direction of research. In line with the model's prediction, further results show that the decrease in publications is largest for scientists at the bottom of the ability distribution. Furthermore, we evidence a change in the direction of research following the reform toward more applied research.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Research on Pharmaceutical Product Life Cycle Management Challenges Faced by Generic Manufacturers for US Approval,Life Cycle Management (LCM); Patents; Exclusivity; Abbreviated New Drug Approval (ANDA); New Drug Application (NDA); ,"Introduction: Generic drug approval before patent expiration involves patent infringement petitions due to robust Life Cycle Management (LCM) strategies followed by Branded companies. They will extend the patent period of a product after expiration through Exclusivity rights, which act as a barrier for generic companies to launch the product immediately after patent expiration. This study focused on United States (US) generic market. Materials and Methods: The research was conducted on three major aspects where generic companies are facing major issues they are, Patent and Exclusivities, Paragraph IV certifications and Emerging Therapeutic areas. We performed a case study by statistical analysis on 2633 US-approved generic drugs on 12 pharma companies in India from 2009 to 2020. Results: In patent litigations, we found that Indian companies have the highest number of patent litigations related to secondary patents and new clinical indication exclusivity. In Paragraph W certifications the Indian companies share was raised to 18%. A parallel study conducted on changes in therapeutic areas of these generic drugs from the past decade revealed that the production of cancer drugs was increased compared to cardiovascular and central nervous system drugs. Conclusion: This study will help in overcoming the above issues, where we explored the knowledge gaps between generic companies and branded companies that are needed to be addressed for successful marketing of generic drugs.",2022,Education & Educational Research; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

The hesitation by developing states to implement new patent exceptions in their domestic laws has presented a barrier to reconciling the tension between protecting patent rights and achieving access to essential medicines for all as committed by states under Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3). This article addresses the uncertainty of the interpretation of Article 30 through a doctrinal analysis of treaty interpretation rules and the recent Australia-Tobacco Plain Packaging decisions. It proposes an original interpretation of Article 30 that permits public interest considerations, and uses this interpretation to justify a proposed stockpiling exception for pandemic and epidemic preparedness aimed at facilitating access to essential medicines to achieve SDG 3. Accordingly, developing states should feel more confident about implementing patent exceptions tailored to their public interest needs in pursuit of SDG 3.",2022,Government & Law,1

Recently, there has been considerable interest in using covalent drugs to target non-catalytic amino acids in proteins to modulate difficult targets (i.e. targeted covalent inhibitors). Covalent compounds contain a wide variety of covalent reacting groups (CRGs), but only a few of these CRGs are present in FDA-approved covalent drugs. Areas covered: This review summarizes a 2020-23 patent landscape analysis that examined trends in the field of covalent drug discovery around targets and organizations. The analysis focused on patent applications that were submitted to the World International Patent Organization and selected using a combination of keywords and structural searches based on CRGs present in FDA-approved drugs. Expert opinion: A total of 707 patent applications from >300 organizations were identified, disclosing compounds that acted at 71 targets. Patent application counts for five targets accounted for similar to 63% of the total counts (i.e. BTK, EGFR, FGFR, KRAS, and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). The organization with the largest number of patent counts was an academic institution (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). For one target, KRAS G12C, the discovery of new drugs was highly competitive (>100 organizations, 186 patent applications).",2024,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Humanly Extended Automation or the Future of Work Seen through Amazon Patents,automation; Amazon; robots; future of work; digital technology; Taylorism; TECHNOLOGY,"Amazon's projects for future automation contribute to anxieties about the marginalization of living labor in warehousing. Yet, a systematic analysis of patents owned by Amazon suggests that workers are not about to disappear from the warehouse floor. Many patents portray machines that increase worker surveillance and work rhythms. Others aim at incorporating workers' activities into machinery to rationalize the labor process in an ever more pervasive form of digital Taylorism. Patents materialize the company's desire for a technological future in which workers act and sense on behalf of machinery, becoming its living and sensing appendages. In this new relationship, humans extend machinery and its reach. Through the work-in-progress process of reaching increasing levels of automation, Amazon develops new technical foundations that consolidate its power in the digital workplace.",2021,Social Issues,1
Patent waiver on COVID-19 vaccine: Indonesian law perspective,COVID-19; pandemic; patent waiver on COVID-19 vaccine; vaccine; ,"The second year of the COVID-19 pandemic has not shown any sign of decline. Considering that COVID-19 is a new virus variant, and vaccines are pharmaceutical and life science products that are full of inventions and innovations, the issue of vaccine patents is in the spotlight and attention of the world. Previously, Indonesia had taken the Government's Patent Implementation mechanism for antiviral and antiretroviral drugs used for HIV and Hepatitis B in an effort to reduce the price of these drugs. In light of the global impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic that causes a large number of victims, the idea arose to apply a patent waiver to the COVID-19 vaccine. Second, to formulate what efforts the Government of Indonesia can take in responding to the patent waiver. Results of this study indicate that a patent waiver will actually have an impact on the exclusive rights attached to the inventor, but efforts to implement patents by the Government while respecting patent holders are considered appropriate in emergency conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic situation, to increase the supply of vaccines globally and provide convenience for the public to access the COVID-19 vaccine. Second, in an effort to address the COVID-19 vaccine patent waiver, Indonesia can apply the Government's Patent Implementation for the COVID-19 vaccine to reduce the price of the vaccine to fulfill public health rights in the midst of the pandemic, while still respecting the vaccine inventors.",2022,Government & Law,1

This raises matters of the UPC's jurisdictional relationship with those national courts. The relationship between the UPC and the non-UPC EU Member State courts is governed by the Brussels Regulation. Once the UPC has begun, the Brussels Regulation will allow, in certain circumstances, the continuance of cross-border actions between the national courts of non-UPC Member States and the UPC itself.

DISCLOSURE OF ORIGIN OF PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES: CHALLENGES FOR SUPPORTING FOOD SECURITY IN INDONESIA,Dislosure of origin; Benefit sharing; Plant genetic resources; Agriculture; Biopiracy; Food security; ,"Protecting plant genetic resources is crucial because they are a key element in supporting food security for Indonesia's growing population. An important element in the protection of plant genetic resources is the disclosure of origin of genetic resources. In line with international standards and commitments, Indonesia has enacted a Patents Act that seeks to protect its plant genetic resources by requiring disclosure of origin. However it is one thing to enact legislation and quite a different thing to effectively implement the legislation to achieve its aims. This paper critically analyses the Indonesian Patent Act and highlights some key issues that undermine the effectivenss of the Act. The paper identifies the problems of implementing provisions of the Act at the normative and practical levels. At the normative, the Act lacks clarity with concepts undefined. This is compounded at the paractical level by a lack of a regulatory framework and inadequate human resources. The paper suggests that given the importance of disclosure of origin in protecting plant genetic resources for Indonesia's food security, developing further legislative and institutional framework on disclosure of origin is an esential strategic solution for the country.",2020,Business & Economics,1
"Patents, healthcare and engaged shareholders: a pathway to encourage socially responsible patent use?",patent law; corporate decision-making; engaged shareholders; licensing of health technologies; access to medicines; Covid-19; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; CORPORATE; ACCESS; COMPETITION; VACCINES; CONTEXT; TRADE,"This paper focuses on the drivers steering companies' behaviour over uses of patented health technologies, taking Covid-19 as a case study. Global equitable access to health technologies is vital to bringing the pandemic under control. Reflecting this, global mechanisms for rightsholders to share intellectual property rights, data and know-how over such health technologies have been developed. Yet, to date, there is limited support from corporate rightsholders for such mechanisms. Instead, health technologies have been licensed largely based on bilateral deals, with vast global inequalities emerging. Given the traditional focus within company law on prioritising shareholders' short-term financial value, we argue that it is unsurprising that many corporate rightsholders adopt a protectionist approach to patents, even in the face of health crises. However, we argue that the tide may now be starting to shift, catalysed by an emergence of engaged shareholders petitioning for socially responsible corporate behaviour, including for uses of intellectual property over health technologies in a manner that more clearly aligns with public interests. If harnessed and encouraged, such engaged shareholder behaviour could present an opportunity to reframe the conception of shareholder value towards one that considers a long-term sustainable approach and ultimately to shift corporate behaviour around uses of intellectual property over health technologies to take public interests into account.",2022,Government & Law,1
The Normative Molecule: Patent Rights and DNA,DNA; genetics; patents; Myriad; innovation; ethics; LAW,"Throughout the biotechnology age, fears about the distortionary effects of property and other legal institutions upon the health and self-determination of individuals and societies have accompanied more popularly sensational fears about unscrupulous choices within the scientific community itself. Still, for most of that time the prevailing legal regime both in the United States and in Europe remained generally permissive of ownership of, and exclusionary power over, the fruits of much biomedical research, though this leniency took different forms and came about in different ways. In particular, the policy of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to grant patents on genetic compositions such as DNA sequences produced an extensive landscape of legal rights that would eventually provoke a backlash in both legal and popular opinion during the Myriad Genetics lawsuit. This case study examines the normative dimension of patent rights over isolated DNA sequences through the lens of the Myriad case, discussing the institutional context in which the case arose and identifying ethical lessons that the case offers.",2020,Chemistry; History & Philosophy of Science,1
The impact of the new environmental protection law on eco-innovation: evidence from green patent data of Chinese listed companies,New Environmental Protection Law; Eco-innovation; Difference-in-difference; Policy evaluation; ,"Innovation is an imperative way of harmonizing the relationship between environmental protection and economic growth. Reasonably creating institutional pressure to stimulate the innovation vitality of enterprises is a crucial issue in promoting the modernization of ecological environment governance systems and governance capacity. This paper considered China's new environmental protection law (NEPL) as a quasi-natural experiment to evaluate the impact of environmental regulation on enterprise eco-innovation in a difference-in-difference (DID) framework. It also identifies the conditions of the NEPL that encourage enterprise eco-innovation. We found that the NEPL significantly hinders the level of enterprise eco-innovation. This inhibition is mainly associated with invention patents with high degrees of innovation rather than utility model patents, resulting from tightening financing constraints. Further, when considering enterprise heterogeneity in terms of ownership, size, and cost transfer ability, private and small-sized enterprises and enterprises with higher cost transfer ability are more affected by the implementation of the NEPL. Furthermore, enterprises with a better business environment are more likely to perform innovation activities. Our findings have valuable implications for evaluating the effects of policy implementation more scientifically and comprehensively, and consequently, promoting the innovation compensation effect of environmental regulation.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Exploring the topology and dynamic growth properties of co-invention networks and technology fields,; INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION; SOCIAL NETWORK; SMALL WORLDS; PATENT; INNOVATION; CYTOSCAPE; EVOLUTION; SOFTWARE; PATTERNS,"This study investigates the topology and dynamics of collaboration networks that exist between inventors and their patent co-authors for patents granted by the USPTO from 2007-2019 (2,241,201 patents and 1,879,037 inventors). We study changes in the configurations of different technology fields via the power-law, small-world, preferential attachment, shrinking diameter, densification law, and gelling point hypotheses. Similar to the existing literature, we obtain mixed results. Based on network statistics, we argue that the sudden rise of large networks in six technology sectors can be understood as a phase transition in which small, isolated networks form one giant component. In two other technology sectors, such a transition occurred much later and much less dramatically. The examination of inventor networks over time reveals the increased complexity of all technology sectors, regardless of the individual characteristics of the network. Therefore, we introduce ideas associated with the technological diversification of inventors to complement our analysis, and we find evidence that inventors tend to diversify into new fields that are less mature. This behavior appears to be correlated with the compliance of some of the expected network rules and has implications for the emerging patterns among the different collaboration networks under consideration here.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1

We complement this explanation by suggesting that the generation of profits from technology is also driven by how effectively firms engage in patent infringement litigation (i.e., take legal action against their rivals) to create isolating mechanisms and protect their technologies. We contend that patent infringement litigation is characterized by industry and geographic specificity that affect (disproportionately) revenue generation and costs and, therefore, its net effect on firm profitability. By identifying contingencies that influence the economic returns from patent litigation, the analysis helps us understand why firms experience different profitability outcomes even when they operate in similar IP regimes and possess similar portfolios of technologies.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Patent trolls in China: Some empirical data,Patent troll; Litigation; Empirical study; Chinese law; ENTITIES; QUALITY,"Prior research found that the Chinese patent system is more pro-patentee than once believed. Patent owners performed much better in both infringement lawsuits and post-grant validity reviews in China than in many other countries, such as the United States and Germany. Also, after a finding of infringement, Chinese courts were quite lenient with regard to permanent injunctions. All these pro-patentee tendencies, together with the rapid growth of China's software industry, cast doubt on the prevalence of troll activities in China. This article analyzes 3435 patent infringement lawsuits decided by local people's courts in China in 2015 and 2016 and provides some valuable insights into two important questions: how often do patent trolls litigate in China, and do they adopt different litigation tactics from practicing entities? Based on empirical data, this article finds that, interestingly, both the number and the size of patent trolls in China are relatively small. Although nearly half (1534, or 44.7%) of all patent infringement lawsuits were initiated by non-practicing entities (NPEs), individual inventors, instead of professional businesses, accounted for an overwhelming majority of all NPE cases (1528, or 99.6%). Patent assertion entities (PAEs), by contrast, only initiated four out of 3435 cases (0.1%) in the two-year period under review. If only patents in the computer industry are taken into consideration, then PAEs initiated zero computer-related lawsuits. Nonetheless, this article does observe some trollish litigation tactics worthy of attention and further research. There were 47 repeat litigants-litigants who initiated 10 or more cases; some performed commercial enforcement, asserting patents against multiple small retailers instead of against one large manufacturer; and patent owners, on average, waited for a rather long time before enforcing their patents in China. All these behaviors may introduce bias to the incentives to innovate and put pressure on the overall functioning of the Chinese patent system. (c) 2020 Renjun Bian. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Issues in patenting 'artificial intelligence' from an EPO perspective,; COMPUTER; REPRODUCIBILITY,"This article demonstrates that artificial intelligence (AI) is generally not a useful category in patent prosecution and patent law to address questions of patentability or inventorship.It has been suggested that inventions relating to AI will pose major problems for patent prosecution, for example regarding patentable subject-matter, sufficiency of disclosure, the level of inventive step or the question of inventorship. In this context, far-reaching assumptions are made about the nature and the powers of AI which are often overstated and distract from real issues. On the one hand, AI defies a precise definition, in particular one which could distinguish AI from other software. Indeed, many questions that arise in patenting AI inventions are also true, one way or another, for other, 'conventional' software.On the other hand, certain AI inventions may be a challenge for applicants to explain convincingly why their invention works and how. In view of this, the problem of AI inventorship that has recently dominated the public discussion is of less practical concern.",2024,Government & Law,1
KEEP ON DANCING: THE SUCCESS AND FAILURES OF PATENT DANCE AS SHOWN BY BPCIA LITIGATION CASES FILED AFTER SANDOZ V. AMGEN,; ,"Congress created the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) intending to establish a market of biosimilars. To enhance negotiation between the parties and to reduce the risks and uncertainties, Congress designed a complicated procedure commonly known as the patent dance for the exchange of information and determination of patents for litigation before the launch of a biosimilar. In 2017, the Supreme Court decided Sandoz v. Amgen, holding that the patent dance is not enforceable by injunction, and commentators worried that participation of biosimilar applicants might decrease afterward. This Article surveys the behaviors of the parties in the patent dance reflected by BPCIA litigations filed after the Sandoz v. Amgen decision until October 2021 and shows that the patent dance scheme facilitates negotiations and settlements between the parties. However, these litigations also indicated that the information exchange might be insufficient compared to what Congress might have envisioned and the two-phased litigation structure might be inefficient for certain kinds of parties. This Article also discusses the proposals to improve the BPCIA and proposes a three-part solution to balance the information exchange and increase the flexibility of participation for better efficiency.",2022,Government & Law,1
Smart Grids and Machine Learning in Chinese and Western Intellectual Property Law The Key Role of Machine Learning in Integrating Sustainable Energy into Smart Grids and the Corresponding Approaches to Asset Protection in Intellectual Property Law,Machine learning; Smart grid; Patent law; Copyright law; AI; Compulsory licensing; ,"Having huge power grids successfully integrate sustainable energy sources requires a smart and flexible power grid management system. Such smart systems have to adapt fast and accurately to a great amount of data input - a task which is made easier by applying modern machine learning technology. Solutions crafted by dynamic and powerful computing algorithms have the potential to surpass human cognitive capabilities. The question arises whether and how intellectual property law can be used to set the right incentives. This paper initially describes the basic functions of smart grids and the corresponding necessity of machine learning. Subsequently, it will analyze the current approaches of the most relevant patent offices in dealing with the challenges of AI-related smart grid inventions. Ultimately, it will be demonstrated that the contemporary discussions fail to focus on practical considerations of market entry possibilities that might be more promising than the approach of creating new exclusionary intellectual property rights.",2021,Government & Law,1

Background Radial artery occlusion (RAO) is a thrombotic complication of transradial catheterization that can lead to permanent occlusion of the radial artery. Sheath-vessel diameter ratio, postprocedure compression time, occlusive hemostasis, inadequate, and excessive anticoagulation are all predictors of RAO. Methods As a part of a previously published study investigating the relationship between residual anticoagulation and risk of RAO, 837 patients undergoing transradial diagnostic coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions were enrolled. Cumulative heparin dose used during the procedure and ACT measured before sheath removal were recorded. PH with reverse Barbeau test was attempted in all patients (NCT02762344). Results PH was less frequently obtained for increasing cumulative heparin dose and ACT values (p < .0001 andp= .0034, respectively). At logistic regression analysis both cumulative heparin dose and ACT values were independent predictors of OH (OR 1.017, 95% IC 1.011-1.023p < .0001 and OR 1.004, 95% IC 1.001-1.006,p= .0004) while adjusted probability for RAO showed exponential relationship with both parameters. Conclusions The level of anticoagulation is strongly related to the incidence of RAO, and should be taken into account when choosing hemostasis protocol.",2021,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,1
COPYRIGHT AND PATENT PROTECTION OF CLOuD STORAGE SOFTWARE IN THE BRICS MEMBER STATES,copyright; intellectual property; BRICS; Russia; China; India; Brazil; South Africa; ,"In the BRICS Member States, serious attention is paid to Information Technology develop-ment in terms of both technology and law. These countries are at the forefront in the development of the digital economy and digital innovations. Cloud storage software is an important element in this sector and is intensively applied in civil law transactions. The processes of approval, storage and sorting of documents are being automated on the basis of the relevant computer programs. This helps companies and government agencies to systemize their operations. At present, the most pressing issues are those related to copyright and copyright holders of computer programs since software code may be copied, even illegally or unconscientiously, and used as the basis for another software product. Cloud storage software is copyright-protected, but, depending on the scope of its use, additional patent protection may be required. Given the rapid development of the IT sector, a software product may be one of the components in an invention subject to patenting. The article focuses on the relationship between copyright and patent protection of software and offers a comparison of the approaches taken by the BRICS countries. Approaches taken by Germany as a European Union Member State and the United States of America are shown in the all-out comparison.

Early Patent Disclosure and R&D Investment in Family Firms,; SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH; CORPORATE DISCLOSURE; PERFORMANCE; OWNERSHIP; PROPRIETARY; AGENCY; PUBLICATION; INFORMATION; INNOVATION; SUBSIDIES,"This paper shows that the American Inventor's Protection Act, which introduced the disclosure of patent applications after 18 months, that is, before a grant decision is taken and, hence, before it is known whether the respective technology will receive legal protection, is associated with a reduction of family firms' research and development (R&D) investment. This suggests that early disclosure of patent applications is perceived as a threat to family firms' innovation activity and discourages their R&D investment. This finding deserves our attention because family firms account for a large share of the US economy, and a reduction in their R&D investment can have long-term consequences.",2024,Business & Economics,1

A firm making more disclosures generates fewer patents and lower-quantity patents. Enactment of SOX is applied as a natural experiment for an exogenous shock to voluntary disclosure. Corporate innovation is reduced for accelerated filers, especially after SOX becomes effective. Nondedicated institutional ownership, R&D spillover, and rival firms' innovation are higher for accelerated filers after SOX. There is more of a negative effect of voluntary disclosure on innovation activity when product markets are highly competitive, industry information diffusion is speedy, and disclosures are more informative.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Commercialisation of Intellectual Property: A Comparative Analysis of Georgia and Estonia,Georgia's and Estonia's legislative frameworks in IP commercialisation; intellectual property; IP commercialisation; INNOVATION,"Commercialisation of intellectual property (IP) constitutes a vital part of a state's economy and signifi cantly contributes to the development and success of any innovative project. At the same time, commercialisation of IP is directly linked to the adopted legislation on patent rights as it regulates the protection and exploitation of IP. This article seeks to compare the IP commercialisation frameworks in Georgia and Estonia and identify the challenges encountered in patent protection mechanisms in Georgia. Estonia and Georgia are both located in the Eastern European region and share similar legal systems and constitutions. By aligning its legislative framework with European Union standards and supporting universities and fostering a culture of innovation, Estonia sets a notable example in IP commercialisation. However, Georgia's legislative framework still lacks certain elements that are crucial for developing IP commercialisation. The low number of registered patent applications in Georgia indicates the challenges and obstacles in this fi eld. The comparison of legal frameworks and practices in these countries can provide important insights into the challenges and solutions in IP commercialisation. The article examines how inefficient legislative framework leads to inconsistent patent protection mechanisms in Georgia, creating barriers in IP commercialisation, while underlining Estonia's success in innovation and the establishment of a progressive IP commercialisation landscape.The article also presents a set of recommendations for Georgia to align its framework with EU standards, initiating joining the European Patent Convention, strengthening IP enforcement, and promoting open IP policies in universities, following Estonia's model.",2024,Government & Law,1
Innovation on the choice of debt financing source: evidence from innovative firms,Innovation; Debt financing source; Tech bubble burst; American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA); G21; G23; G28; G32; INFORMATION; INVESTMENT; PRIVATE,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the innovative firm's proprietary information has an impact on its debt financing preference. This study also examines the impact of industry-level competition on the debt financing orders and investigates how two exogenous shocks impacted on innovative firms' financing policies. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the three types of debt data, including bonds, private debt placements and bank loans and patent application data, in the USA from 1987-2008. The number of patents applications and industry-level competition are used as proxies for a firm's innovation and industry-level sensitivity. In addition, to minimize endogenous concern, this study uses the propensity score matching analysis and difference-in-differences. Findings The patents are the primary determinants for innovative firms to choose the debt types. The paper shows that innovative firms have the debt preference order - public debt, private placement and bank loans. However, as competition increases, innovative firms devise the order reverse. Finally, the paper provides evidence that the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA) and the tech bubble crash made investors depend more on firms with more patents. Originality/value This paper is the first to study the impact of the AIPA on innovative firms' financial policies using the propensity score matching analysis. The findings imply that both patents and industry-level competition are important factors to understand the capital structures for innovative firms.",2021,Business & Economics,1
A Comprehensive Compulsory License under the WTO TRIPS: Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Compulsory License, Covid-19; Patent Bargain with the Government; TRIPS Waiver; Vaccine Equity; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; DECISION-MAKING; CONSENSUS; ACCESS; HEALTH; IMPACT","urpose - The primary purpose of this research is to refine the concept of the Comprehensive Compulsory License System in legal context combining IP laws, international trade laws, and the Common Law of contracts to achieve a harmonious equilibrium. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the global supply chain of vaccines prioritized developed countries to an extreme degree. The global health community requested that the developed countries and pharmaceutical companies producing the vaccines strive for vaccine equity. However, the pharmaceutical companies producing COVID-19 vaccines were reluctant to waive their intellectual property rights. To resolve this stalemate and meet the demand for vaccines by LDCs, we propose a comprehensive compulsory license system. Design/Methodology - Our research analyzes a potential bargain between inventors and governments to support vaccine equity by proposing a new compulsory license system in the post-pandemic era. Findings - The European Union was against the waiver, while the United States changed its initial position to eventually support the waiver. In practice, the stringent consensus rule of the WTO's Ministerial Conference may make it so that waiver requests are not always granted. The existing compulsory license over vaccine patents was not sufficient because vaccine production requires all types of IP, including secret information. Originality/value - This new system is based on the disclosure theory of patents and the concept of patent quid pro quo. The proposed design may work as an essential option to resolve the defects in the global vaccine supply chain",2024,Business & Economics,1
Labor Contract Law and inventor mobility: evidence from China,Employment protection; Inventor mobility; Labor Contract Law; China; EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION; DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY; CAPITAL STRUCTURE; PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; FIRMS; NETWORKS; DATABASE; TAXATION,"This paper investigates the causal effect of employment protection on inventor mobility. Taking the enactment of China's Labor Contract Law in 2008 as a quasi-natural experiment, our difference-in-difference estimate utilizes two-dimensional variations: firm ownership (i.e., SOEs vs. non-SOEs) and year (i.e., before and after 2008). Using combined data on patent applications filed at the State Intellectual Property Office of China and listed manufacturing companies over 2004-2012, we find that the law plays a sizeable positive role in reducing the likelihood of inventor mobility. This effect is more pronounced for firms with higher labor intensity, stricter law enforcement, higher innovation dependence, lower R&D team stability, and inventors that work outside the core of R&D networks. Further, we provide consistent evidence for two plausible mechanisms for the positive effect: limiting the ability of employers to unfairly dismiss inventors and substituting low-skilled workers with inventors. In addition, the law causes firms to obtain more high-quality patents and reduces bankruptcy risk. Overall, our findings shed new light on the economic effects of labor protection in a typical emerging market.",2024,Demography; Business & Economics,1

Using a regression-discontinuity framework, we find that incentives to engage in EPS-motivated buybacks are followed by more citations and higher values for firms' new patents. We trace these effects to improved allocation of R&D resources and a greater focus on novel innovation. The positive effects are concentrated among ex ante innovation-efficient firms that achieve better patenting outcomes after reorganizing (but not cutting) their R&D investments. Our findings illustrate that short-term earnings pressure can act through a free cash flow channel that motivates more efficient spending.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Forcing Supreme Court Review by the Federal Circuit,; PATENT-LAW; EN-BANC; CERTIORARI; UNIFORMITY; DOCKET,"From time to time, a federal court of appeals may want the Supreme Court to take a case because it is stuck: there is an unresolved issue that is important to the day-to-day administration of justice, but an en banc sitting would be futile. The Supreme Court, however, has a haystack problem: it receives several thousand certiorari petitions each year, of which approximately 1% receive plenary review. The literature suggests that the selection of the certworthy needles in this petition haystack is a black-box process affected by discretion and situational factors that make timely review unpredictable and difficult to obtain. Among the federal appellate courts, the difficulty of securing timely Supreme Court review may be the most problematic for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which was established to create and maintain a uniform, coherent body of patent law precedents. Because of its exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases, if the Federal Circuit gets stuck, its impact is felt nationwide. Compared to the other circuits, the Federal Circuit might be more dependent on the Supreme Court in some ways, because there is no intercircuit percolation of patent law. Ironically, the Federal Circuit may have more difficulty signaling when review is necessary because there are no circuit splits in patent law. Accordingly, using the Federal Circuit as a case study, this Article proposes the creation of a mechanism for bypassing the Supreme Court's certiorari haystack to secure timely review of cases that are important to the day-to-day administration of justice. Specifically, Congress should give the judges of the Federal Circuit the power to periodically invoke (e.g., once a year)-through a majority vote of its regular active judges-either mandatory appellate jurisdiction or mandatory certified question jurisdiction at the Supreme Court to secure review of a case or a discrete issue. By providing a supplemental pathway to Supreme Court review that can be invoked directly by the Federal Circuit judges themselves, the proposal effectively sets up a hotline between the two courts and reserves a slot on the high court's plenary docket for a case that was selected with the benefit of the Federal Circuit's expertise. As a result, a tighter, more robust feedback loop is created between the generalist Supreme Court that makes broad pronouncements and the specialist appellate court that is charged with operationalizing those pronouncements for day-to-day adjudication. Because all appellate courts (not just the Federal Circuit) have an interest in obtaining timely Supreme Court intervention when necessary, this Article might also be of interest to audiences beyond patent law who are seeking ideas for reforming the Supreme Court.",2023,Government & Law,1
Cambodia's Imminent Graduation from Least Developed Country Status: What Will be the Impact of the TRIPS Agreement on Access to HIV and Hepatitis C Medicines in Cambodia?,TRIPS; intellectual property; hepatitis C; antiretroviral; direct acting antiviral; patent; generic; HIV; Cambodia; ,"Cambodia has experienced exponential economic growth in recent years and is expected to graduate from least developed country (LDC) status within the next decade. Membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) will require Cambodia to grant product and process patents for pharmaceuticals upon LDC graduation. This study aims to measure the impact of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on the price of HIV and hepatitis C medicine in Cambodia once it graduates from LDC status and is obliged to make patents available for pharmaceutical products and processes. Using scenarios based on likely outcomes of accession to the TRIPS Agreement, it measures the impact on the price of the HIV treatment program and compares that impact with the hepatitis C treatment program. Graduation from LDC status would be expected to result in a modest increase in the cost of the antiretroviral (ARV) treatment program and very large increases in the cost of the direct acting antivirals (DAA) treatment program. If annual treatment budgets remain constant, patent protection could see 1,515 fewer people living with HIV able to access ARV treatment and 2,577 fewer people able to access DAA treatment (a drop in treatment coverage of 93%).",2024,Health Care Sciences & Services,1
Immaculate Conception?

The PTAB reached this verdict even though competing researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, among other institutions, could document the idea 7 months earlier.

In this study, I explain that requirement, detail the PTAB's interference decision, and discuss the decision's practical effects on CRISPR technology and routine science.",2022,Genetics & Heredity,1
Judicial Policing of Patent Damages Experts,; ,"The calculation of patent damages such as a reasonable royalty presents significant challenges for which the use of expert testimony is predictable, if not unavoidably vital. Struggles to employ and at the same time guide and restrain expert testimony on reasonable royalty damages have become prominent in the last two decades, in substantial part because of the rise of patent assertion entities (PAEs) that have intensified stresses on the United States patent system. Patent law's peculiarly centralized court of appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has responded to such stresses by limiting the admissibility or cognizable sufficiency of expert evidence on reasonable royalties for patent infringement. Although seemingly more aggressive than the general appellate norm, this appellate-level activity has so far appeared in line with general understandings of the proper judicial role in regulating expert testimony and reliance on it. A strict understanding of the Federal Circuit's rule of apportionment based on the smallest salable patent-practicing unit (SSPPU) might lead to an undue downward distortion of reasonable royalty awards under certain circumstances, but there currently seems enough flex in the articulation of the rule to accommodate corrective adjustments. Although imperfect, the current approach to regulating expert testimony on patent damages seems to embody at least a plausibly satisfactory form of muddling through, approximating the demands for reasoned analysis that courts commonly impose on the work of expert administrative agencies.",2020,Government & Law,1
Global Innovation Trends for Plant-Based Vaccines Production: A Patent Analysis,innovation; patents; COVID-19; plant-based vaccines; biopharma; ,"The use of plants as biofactories for the production of medical products and vaccines has a long history, but the recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused this set of technologies, for their potential to contribute to the development of innovative solutions for tackling pandemic spread worldwide, to rise in prominence. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the global innovation scenario of plant-based vaccine production. Methods: Patent search using a specific set of technical classification codes and keywords was performed using the Questel-Orbit database, with a final output of 180 patent families, corresponding to 1397 single patents. Results: Plant-based vaccines production is an innovation sector with positive development especially in the last five-year period (30% growth). Fifty percent of the patents were registered in the United States, standing out as the most attractive patent system worldwide. The inventive activity was led by private firms owning the 49% of the patent families, and the key-players group includes the companies that successfully developed plant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates, indicating a strong connection between the expertise in innovation production and the capacity to adapt inventions to the current pandemic vaccine demand. Virus-like particles technology has increased in importance over the past few years. Conclusion: Patent data confirm their relevant role as indicators of innovation and technological evolution. Plant-based vaccines are expected to acquire an increasing role over the next few years as the current pandemic acts as an innovation catalyst.",2021,Plant Sciences,1

Inter-organisational patent opposition network: how companies form adversarial relationships,Patent oppositions; Adversarial relationships; Negative relationships; Inter-organisational networks; Network analysis; Motif analysis; INNOVATION,"Much of the research on networks using patent data focuses on citations and the collaboration networks of inventors, hence regarding patents as a positive sign of invention. However, patenting is, most importantly, a strategic action used by companies to compete with each other. This study sheds light on inter-organisational adversarial relationships in patenting for the first time. We constructed and analysed the network of companies connected via patent opposition relationships that occurred between 1980 and 2018. A majority of the companies are directly or indirectly connected to each other and hence form the largest connected component. We found that, in the network, many companies disapprove patents in various industrial sectors as well as those owned by foreign companies. The network exhibits heavy-tailed, power-law-like degree distribution, and assortative mixing. We further investigated the dynamics of the formation of this network by conducting a temporal network motif analysis, with patent co-ownership among the companies being considered. By regarding opposition as a negative relationship and patent co-ownership as a positive relationship, we analysed where collaboration may occur in the opposition network and how such positive relationships would interact with negative relationships. The results identified the structurally imbalanced triadic motifs and the temporal patterns of the occurrence of triads formed by a mixture of positive and negative relationships. Our findings suggest that the mechanisms of the emergence of the inter-organisational adversarial relationships may differ from those of other types of negative relationships, hence necessitating further research.",2021,Business & Economics,1

COMPETING WITH PATENT THICKETS: ANTITRUST LAW'S ROLE IN PROMOTING BIOSIMILARS,; DATA EXCLUSIVITY; BIOLOGICS,"Biologics, a new class of large-molecule drugs, have revolutionized the healthcare industry, offering powerful treatments to previously untreatable diseases. However, the complex science required to create a biologic results in extremely high development costs, which translates into expensive drug prices. In an effort to combat these high prices, Congress implemented a regulatory framework to allow competing companies to create generic versions of biologics, called biosimilars. Despite this framework, very few biosimilars have entered the U.S. market. Why? One major roadblock is the patents the original biologic manufacturer obtains to protect its drug. Because of the complexity of biologics, companies can create patent thickets, dense webs of overlapping patents on the drug and the processes for creating it. This huge volume of patents can obscure the scope of what the company owns and what a hopeful biosimilar manufacturer can do without facing patent litigation. These thickets can also extend the period during which the original manufacturer can exclusively market the drug. Because of the high development costs associated with biologic and biosimilar development, few companies have the resources to enter the space. Patent thickets further limit competition for the original biologic, resulting in high drug prices for patients years after the original patents expire. After explaining why the scientific constraints and regulatory environment already make biosimilar manufacturing a difficult process, this Note explores how biologic companies create patent thickets and wield them to threaten biosimilar manufacturers, sometimes forcing them into collusive settlement agreements. Finally, this Note argues that the formation and anticompetitive use of patent thickets to prevent biosimilar competition should warrant antitrust sanction.",2022,Government & Law,1
DEFECTIVE PATENT DEFERENCE,; SUPREME-COURT; CHEVRON; OFFICE; FOUNDATIONS; QUESTIONS; STANDARDS; SHADOW; RULES; PTO,"The Supreme Court's implicit deference to the Office of the Solicitor General in patent cases is well-documented: What the Solicitor General requests, the Solicitor General typically receives. But we know far less about how the Solicitor General arrives at these preferred policy positions, or why the Solicitor General comes to advocate for some outcomes over others. This is problematic. In practically every other corner of the administrative state, an agency earns substantial deference to its views only where robust procedural protections attend to the policymaking process, where the agency's outcome reflects its substantive expertise, and where the agency may, through presidential removal and election, be held politically accountable for its policy choices. Not so in patent law. The Patent Office has never claimed to exercise any substantive rulemaking power. Meanwhile, the Solicitor General develops and advocates for patent policy outcomes, but behind closed doors, without deep internal expertise, and under the time constraints of appellate litigation. These shortcomings (among others) suggest that we should reexamine the Solicitor General's influence over patent policy in favor of alternate interpretive practices that improve Executive Branch decisionmaking. And they counsel in favor of several reforms most importantly, to the policymaking power of the Patent Office.",2020,Government & Law,1
The Intellectual Property-Antitrust Interface,Antitrust policy; Intellectual property; Patents; ,"There is a tension between the antitrust laws and the intellectual property (IP) laws. Both aim to promote social welfare, but their focus differs. By and large, antitrust law aims to promote competition and static welfare. In contrast, IP law permits static welfare losses in exchange for dynamic welfare gains. Thus, there is a tradeoff between static and dynamic welfare considerations. This tradeoff leads to a natural tension between IP law and antitrust policy. Implicitly, we believe that the benefits of long-term progress outweigh the short-run welfare losses that are due to the misallocation of resources. This can be seen in our Special Issue.",2020,Business & Economics,1
R&D Investment and Debt Financing of High-Tech Firms in Emerging Economies: The Role of Patents and State Ownership,Research and development; Investment; Costs; Patents; Government; Uncertainty; Technological innovation; China; debt financing; patents; R and D; state ownership; CASH FLOW; INNOVATION PERFORMANCE; DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDIES; CORPORATE-FINANCE; FRUGAL INNOVATION; SIGNALING THEORY; BUSINESS; MARKET; CHINA; APPROPRIATION,"Substantial R&D investment can increase high-tech firms' potential to establish long-term competitive advantages. Yet it can also cause high levels of transaction costs that may be an obstacle to accessing debt financing. In this article, we examine the influence of R&D investment on firms' debt financing in emerging economies. Then, we explore how a firm's patents and state ownership alter this influence. Leveraging a panel dataset comprising 1084 Chinese high-tech manufacturing firms during a 12-year period from 2007 to 2018, we find that R&D investment has a direct negative effect on a firm's debt financing, which may be mediated by a firm's patents. Explicitly, R&D investment increases a firm's likelihood of having a patent, which in turn facilitates access to debt financing, because the patent acts as a signal. State ownership makes the negative direct influence of R&D investment more salient as a moderator, whereas it also moderates the positive influence of patents on debt financing in an inverted U-shaped pattern. Thus, our article not only reveals that R&D-intensive firms do face financing constraints in emerging economies but also indicates how patents and state ownership can relax or tighten the constraints.",2024,Business & Economics; Engineering,1
Repositioning Generic Drugs: Empirical Findings and Policy Implications,Drug repositioning; Patent law; Regulatory protection; Clinical trials; Empirical study; Generic drugs; MEDICAL USES; PATENTS,"Commentators claim that drug repositioning (i.e. developing new uses for authorised drugs) significantly slows when generics are authorised and, therefore, law reform is necessary to encourage more R&D. This study empirically examines this claim by analysing records of clinical trials. It finds that once generics are authorised: (i) commercial trials continue at active rates for approximately half of the drugs studied, and (ii) the number of hospital and university trials actually increases. These findings cast doubt on whether additional incentives are needed. They also indicate that a more effective way to reposition drugs is for recently established government programmes to embrace IP strategies and leverage the hospital and university trials as an R&D pipeline.",2022,Government & Law,1

This study outlines the depository management patterns of microorganisms and information related to their current development and urgency. This research uses comparative legal methods to determine the characteristics of the depository of microorganisms for patent application purposes between the Indonesian Patent Law, the Budapest Treaty, and Nagoya Protocols. It was later discovered that this preparation procedure was correlated with fulfilling patent registration obligations within the framework of legal protection and had the function to protect genetic resources and comply with the provisions of the Nagoya Protocol, which the Government of Indonesia has ratified. Therefore, besides being supported by international standard management and depository infrastructure, this mechanism also requires legal protection by ratifying the Budapest Treaty.",2022,Government & Law,1
The Patentability of Second and Subsequent Medical Uses in Asia's Patent Legislation,patents; pharmaceuticals; TRIPS agreement; new use of known medical substances; novelty; inventive step; Asian patent law; EUROPE,"This study examines, from a comparative law perspective, how jurisdictions across East, Southeast and South Asia deal with the issue of the patentability of second/subsequent medical uses. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of subsequent medical uses of known medical compositions, as a number of medicines that are being used to treat Covid-19 were originally developed for other illnesses. The decision whether second/subsequent medical uses of pharmaceuticals are patentable in any given jurisdiction is, however, a policy decision to the extent that it is one of the main exclusions available to countries as a 'flexibility' under the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement). The results of this study show that there is a wide variation in Asia regarding the patentability of second/subsequent uses, and examines the possible reasons for this variation.

Can Staggered Boards Improve Value? Causal Evidence from Massachusetts*,staggered board; life cycle; Tobin's Q; investments; innovation; investor composition; POWERFUL ANTITAKEOVER FORCE; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS; FIRM VALUE; TAKEOVER LAWS; INNOVATION,"Staggered boards (SBs) are one of the most potent common entrenchment devices, and their value effects are considerably debated. We study SBs' effects on firm value, managerial behavior, and investor composition using a quasi-experimental setting: a 1990 law that imposed SBs on all Massachusetts-incorporated firms. We find that relative to a matched control group of companies, for treated companies the law led to an increase in Tobin's Q, investment in capital expenditures and R&D, patents, and higher-quality patented innovations, resulting in higher profitability. These effects are concentrated in innovating firms, especially those facing greater Wall Street scrutiny. An increase in institutional and dedicated investors also accompanied the imposition of SBs, facilitating a longer-term orientation. The evidence suggests that SBs can benefit early-life-cycle firms facing high information asymmetries by allowing their managers to focus on long-term investments and innovations.",2021,Business & Economics,1

This effect is more pronounced for firms that are more concerned about the proprietary costs of disclosure and firms with lower financial constraints. Moreover, we show that the enactment of the AIA dampens analysts' information environment and aggravates information asymmetry. Overall, our results suggest that the AIA has a negative impact on corporate disclosure and information asymmetry.

Is Legal Harmonization Always Better? The Counter-Case of Utility Models,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; PATENT SYSTEM; LAW; MYTH; APPROPRIABILITY; PROTECTION; INNOVATION,"Policy makers and international institutions have long maintained that the global business environment is best supported when countries harmonize by adopting substantially uniform legal structures. This is particularly true in the context of intellectual property rights. When such national systems are similar, we believe that investment is undergirded and market participation is facilitated. However, this assumption may be incorrect in some cases. Marginal disharmony in certain intellectual property rights may provide countries space for experimentation while not impeding effective management of global intellectual property portfolios at the firm level. As evidence, we look to the utility model. This long-standing form of invention right is conspicuously and surprisingly unstandardized across the world, yet our analysis, using PATSTAT data, reveals that firms are able to negotiate this disharmony effectively. We employ a novel empirical method that tracks U.S.-priority patents to establish that firms use utility models to optimize their overall appropriability needs by region. Our study finds evidence that a firm may choose standard patent protection in one region and utility model protection in another, even though standard patent protection is available in both settings. We propose that a zone of appropriability preference exists when utility models and standard patents overlap, and this zone provides important strategic opportunities to firms with global intellectual properly portfolios. Our study thus provides an important counter-case for harmonization of national intellectual property laws. As a result, we suggest that such efforts be undertaken with more caution; in some cases, harmonization may do more harm than good.",2021,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1
Proprietary Costs: Why Do R&D-Active Firms Choose Single-Lender Financing?,proprietary costs; R&D-active firms; single-lender financing; American Inventor's Protection Act; financing innovation; PRODUCT-MARKET COMPETITION; CORPORATE DISCLOSURE; ACCOUNTING INFORMATION; PATENT PUBLICATION; EARNINGS QUALITY; CREDITOR RIGHTS; PRIVATE; INCENTIVES; INVESTMENT; INNOVATION,"We examine whether proprietary costs drive R&D-active firms' choice of private loan structure. We find that R&D-active firms are more likely to choose single-lender over multi-lender private loan financing. This is consistent with the theory that high-ability entrepreneurs protect their proprietary knowledge by communicating it to a single lender while disclosing generic and less sensitive information to the public. This propensity, however, significantly decreases after the enactment of the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA), which accelerated public disclosure of firms' patent details in filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This accelerated public disclosure potentially caused R&D information to spill over to rivals, increasing the proprietary costs of single-lender borrowers. AIPA enactment also increased the spread on R&D-active firms' single-lender loans. These findings contribute to the voluntary disclosure and financing choice literature by linking R&D-active firms' choice of singlelender financing to the proprietary costs of public disclosure.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Evolution of Digital Health and Exploration of Patented Technologies (2017-2021): Bibliometric Analysis,technology trends; digital health; patent; bibliometric analysis; ,"Background: The significant impact of digital health emerged prominently during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, there is a paucity of bibliometric analyses focusing on technologies within the field of digital health patents. Patents offer a wealth of insights into technologies, commercial prospects, and competitive landscapes, often undisclosed in other publications. Given the rapid evolution of the digital health industry, safeguarding algorithms, software, and advanced surgical devices through patent systems is imperative. The patent system simultaneously acts as a valuable repository of technological knowledge, accessible to researchers. This accessibility facilitates the enhancement of existing technologies and the advancement of medical equipment, ultimately contributing to public health improvement and meeting public demands. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to gain a more profound understanding of technology hotspots and development trends within the field of digital health. Methods: Using a bibliometric analysis methodology, we assessed the global technological output reflected in patents on digital health published between 2017 and 2021. Using Citespace5.1R8 and Excel 2016, we conducted bibliometric visualization and comparative analyses of key metrics, including national contributions, institutional affiliations, inventor profiles, and technology topics. Results: A total of 15,763 digital health patents were identified as published between 2017 and 2021. The China National Intellectual Property Administration secured the top position with 7253 published patents, whereas Koninklijke Philips emerged as the leading institution with 329 patents. Notably, Assaf Govari emerged as the most prolific inventor. Technology hot spots encompassed categories such as Medical Equipment and Information Systems, Image Analysis, and Electrical Diagnosis, classified by Derwent Manual Code. A patent related to the technique of receiving and transmitting data through microchips Conclusions: The trajectory of digital health patents has been growing since 2017, primarily propelled by China, the United States, and Japan. Applications in health interventions and enhancements in surgical devices represent the predominant scenarios for digital health technology. Algorithms emerged as the pivotal technologies protected by patents, whereas techniques related to data transfer, storage, and exchange in the digital health domain are anticipated to be focal points in forthcoming basic research.INTERACTIVE JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH",2024,Research & Experimental Medicine,1
Inventorship Standards for Biotechnology Inventions Under the US and Japanese Patent Acts,Inventorship; Ownership; Biotechnology; U; S; Patent Act; Japanese Patent Act; First-to-invent; First-to-file; Conception; Reduction to practice; ,"This article highlights differences between the United States and Japanese inventorship standards by comparing a U.S. Federal Circuit decision and a Tokyo District Court decision in which inventorship of the same invention was disputed. It further discusses how Japanese courts, by applying Japanese inventorship standards, would not find one of the U.S. researchers in this case to be inventors, despite the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) finding inventorship while applying the U.S. standard. It argues that the U.S. standard is over-inclusive by including individuals who did not contribute to any part of the inventive process, but that the Japanese standard is too difficult to meet and may exclude inventors who made an important contribution. The over-inclusive U.S. standard is influenced by the legacy of first-to-invent: a formality requirement that all individual inventors must contribute to every claim to file a single application and a substantive requirement that an inventor's prior joint invention is the prior art against her later invention unless the same group of individual inventors made both inventions. The article concludes with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of applying the U.S. and Japanese standards for determining inventorship of biotechnology inventions and proposes a harmonization of inventorship standards through the leadership of the World Intellectual Property Organization.",2021,Government & Law,1
Dealing with the mailbox dilemma: tryst with TRIPS and Bangladesh's pharmaceutical patent law,Bangladesh; mailbox patent application; TRIPS; graduating LDC; pharmaceuticals; access to medicine; HUMAN-RIGHTS; HEALTH; PROTECTION; FRAMEWORK; AGREEMENT; TREATIES,"Bangladesh is scheduled to graduate from the United Nations' least developed country (LDC) category in 2026. The graduation to developing country status will revive all the waived obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) regarding pharmaceutical patents from which Bangladesh was exempted as a member of the LDCs. During its time as an LDC, the Bangladesh government, although having a pre-existing patent regime, established a mailbox system storing pharmaceutical patent applications. Such establishment of a `mailbox' appears to be beyond the government's delegated legislative authority. Moreover, the government kept receiving such applications for the last one and half decades. This article explores the country's mailbox dilemma and the implications and challenges of its graduation to developing country status. To respond to such conundrums, this article lays down some immediate and long-term ways forward for the country to ensure access to medicines for its people, who continue to experience huge income inequality.",2022,Government & Law,1

Firms that engage more in lobbying have more patents, more patent citations, and greater patent value. We establish this causality using instrumental variables estimation. Corporate lobbying plays a role of persuasion and fosters firm innovation by transmitting valuable information to politicians, which enhances firms' external political environment. The impact of lobbying on innovation is more pronounced for firms with comparative advantages in the product market, financial health, ESG performance, and institutional support. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of firms' information value in the political process and provide new insights into how lobbying buffs firm development.",2024,Business & Economics,1
"Trade Secret Protection on a Publicly Sold, Patented Spinal Implant Device: Life Spine, Inc. v. Aegis Spine, Inc.",trade secret; misappropriation; spinal implant; Defend Trade Secrets Act; confidentiality; ,"This article analyzes Life Spine, Inc. v. Aegis Spine, Inc., 8 F.4th 531 (7th Cir. 2021), an important decision providing trade secret protection on a publicly sold, patented spinal implant device. For an implant comprised of multiple components and subcomponents, the precise measurements of the implant's components and subcomponents can be protectable as trade secret information, even though a patent has disclosed the implant's structure. Life Spine teaches that a patent covering such an implant reveals nothing about how to measure precise dimensions of those components or subcomponents, that public displays of an implant product must be done with limiting a visitor's ability to observe the product, that an implant product is sold through non-public channels directly to surgeons or hospitals, and that delivery and surgical use of an implant product must be done with forbidding others who have no confidentiality duties from examining the implant product.",2023,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1
The division of labour between academia and industry for the generation of radical inventions,Radical invention; Novelty; Patent; Recombination; Public research; BAYH-DOLE ACT; TECHNOLOGICAL NOVELTY; PATENT QUALITY; SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; INNOVATION; UNIVERSITIES; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; REFERENCES; DIFFUSION,"The paper investigates the relationship between public research and radical technological development. This study draws on the theory of recombinant innovation and builds on two newly developed indicators of novelty that proxy different forms of radicalness, to analyse UK patents filed at the European Patent Office. It assesses whether the proximity of the invention to public research is related to a higher probability of the invention being radical. The results show that, depending on the type of novelty embodied by the radical invention (novelty in recombination or novelty in technological origin), different forms of public research output (proprietary output or open science) relate to the radicalness of invention in different ways. Moreover, these relationships are highly heterogeneous among technological sectors, and most of the proximity between codified public research and radical inventions occurs in the chemistry technology field. We provide some implications for policy.",2020,Engineering; Business & Economics,1
Relationship between industry royalty and licensing payments and patent authorship among orthopedic spine surgeons,Open Payments; orthopedic spine surgery; Physician Payments Sunshine Act; royalties and licensing; DATABASE,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, medical supplies, and biologics to record all financial relationships with physicians in the Open Payments database with the goal of increasing transparency for patients and the general public. The majority of total money going to orthopedic surgeons has been found to go to a small number of surgeons in the form of royalties and licensing payments. This category of payment is intended to compensate physicians for use of their intellectual property. However, little research has been done to investigate the degree to which these physicians own intellectual property. PURPOSE: To the authors' knowledge, the association between patents and industry payments to orthopedic surgeons has not been explored. We quantify the association between the patents and academic productivity of orthopedic spine surgeons and the amount of royalty and licensing fees they receive. We then compared this with the associations observed for other categories of payments. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study METHODS: Top royalty and licensing earners, defined as those who collectively earned 50% of all royalty and licensing payments over the period August 2013- December 2018, were identified. The h-index, publication count, and patent count of this group were compared with top earners of other payment categories using the Mann-Whitney U test. The association between (1) earnings and patent counts, (2) earnings and manuscript counts, and (3) earnings and h-index among the top royalty and licensing earners was assessed using Spearman correlation. RESULTS: Top royalty and licensing earners had significantly more patents than every comparison group except the top earners of money derived from ownership in a biomedical company. For this one exception, there was a trend toward the top eight royalty and licensing earners having more patents (p=.054). The top royalty and licensing earners had significantly more manuscripts than three of the five comparison groups and significantly higher h-indices than four of the five comparison groups. Among the top royalty and licensing earners, receiving more royalty and licensing payments was associated with holding more patents, but not with publishing more papers or having higher h-indices. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association between the number of patents authored by individual orthopedic spine surgeons and the amount of royalty and licensing fees they receive from industry. This supports the hypothesis that these payments serve as compensation to inventor-surgeons for their intellectual property.",2021,Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics,1
Compelling Trade Secret Sharing,; COVID-19; LAW; VACCINES; STATUTES,"The unprecedented COVID-19 virus has brought to the forefront many challenges associated with exclusive rights in information, data, and know-how, all of which may constitute protected trade secrets. While patents have received more attention, trade secret information has limited the ability to perform research, develop, test, gain regulatory approval for, manufacture, and distribute globally and at sufficient scale and affordable prices the needed vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, medical devices, and personal protective equipment. Voluntary licensing efforts have proven inadequate to supply pandemic needs. Thus, compelling the sharing or licensing of trade secrets is needed not only to properly address COVID-19, but more importantly to address future pandemics and other serious global problems such as climate change. This Article explains the nature of trade secrets and their protection. It then describes the failures in COVID-19 responses resulting from trade secrets that were not voluntarily licensed. It explains why patent law disclosures have been inadequate to assure competitive global research, development, and production. Given the need for compelled trade secret sharing, this Article surveys the relevant international intellectual property law treaties addressing trade secrets. It demonstrates that, consistent with international law obligations, governments are free to compel trade secret sharing. Further, governments may not be obliged to award compensation for such sharing when regulating to address public health. Given this national freedom to act, this Article then provides numerous examples of existing United States, European, and other authorities that have been or could be used to compel the sharing or licensing of trade secrets. It also notes the potential to adopt more explicit legislation authorizing compelled or induced behaviors. This survey of authorities illustrates that compelling trade secret sharing or licensing should be unobjectionable whenever there is a need to protect lives, health, or the economy. Accordingly, this Article provides a first critical step toward rethinking the nature of international trade secret protections and seeks to develop the political will for governments to protect the global public from the harms that trade secret rights can generate.",2023,Government & Law,1
An Empirical Analysis of Patent Citation Relevance and Applicant Strategy,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; KNOWLEDGE; LOCALIZATION; EVOLUTION; SEARCH,"Patent examination should ensure that only novel and nonobvious technologies are patented. This evaluation requires comparing the invention to technologies described in public documents-called prior art. Examiners and applicants have obligations to cite known prior art that is material to whether the patent is issued. Beyond documenting examination, citations are used as metrics in a significant body of research. The importance of citations as a predictive metric rests on the assumption that they provide evidence of continued development in the relevant field. Research indicates that some citations are, however, made for reasons beyond technological similarity. This undermines the notion that citations show continued growth of a technology. We analyze this assumption-and correct for inaccuracies-by employing similarity metrics to characterize the relatedness of technologies described in two patent documents (i.e., citing and cited references). To this end, we use a Jaccard Index to quantify textual similarity-and thus technological relatedness-of two documents. Using this method, we empirically analyze strategic behaviors in patent law that were previously only theoretically described in the literature. For example, some patent applicants bury relevant references-submitting many irrelevant references and a few relevant ones to hinder review of the important ones. Our Jaccard Index analysis is the first to empirically evaluate whether this practice benefits the applicant. Moreover, we improve upon patent value and grant rate analyses and demonstrate that citation relevance has a significant impact above and beyond a count of citations made.",2022,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1
Personal income tax and corporate innovation: The key role of inventors' financial incentives,Personal income tax; Corporate innovation; Inventors ' financial incentives; Revised PIT law of 2011; China; FIRM INNOVATION; MARRIED-COUPLES; MOBILITY; CHINA; TAXATION; PROPERTY; INVESTMENT; RESPONSES; ADOPTION; NETWORK,"Despite the importance of the personal income tax around the world, little is known about its impact on innovation. We construct a large database of inventors who patented at publicly listed companies during the 2008 -2016 period and exploit the revised Personal Income Tax (PIT) Law of 2011 in China as a quasi -natural experiment to establish the causal effect of the personal income tax on corporate innovation. Using a difference -in -differences identification strategy, we show that a lower personal income tax rate has a significantly positive impact on patent quantity and quality. Further, the revised PIT Law raises the efficiency of R &D activities, induces more explorative innovation, and improves the success rate of patent applications, providing consistent evidence for the intentional effort channel. Moreover, this positive innovation effect is more pronounced in firms with an R &D team that is more sensitive to the salary incentive system, greater innovation dependence, better governance, and firms located in regions with better innovation environments. Taken together, our findings shed light on how inventors and firms respond to decreasing personal income tax rates and confirm that the net return to innovation can be vital to the innovation capacity of firms.",2024,Business & Economics,1
NONDISCRIMINATION IN STANDARD ESSENTIAL PATENTS; ND PRONG V. ART. 102(C) TFEU,; COMPETITION LAW; POLICY; DISCRIMINATION; JUSTIFICATIONS; EFFICIENCIES; CONTEXT; LIMITS; ABUSE,"The article analyses the meaning of the nondiscriminatory principle in disputes concerning Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) under EU competition and contract law (that is, ND prong). The article reviews the economics literature, looking at the welfare effect of price discrimination and the interpretation of the ND prong provided by a number of economists. Secondly, the article analyses the case law of the EU Court of Justice on Art. 102(c) TFEU and recent rulings by the German and British courts concerning the scope of the application of the ND prong. A strategy of discrimination in regard to royalty rates may be sanctioned, both under competition and contract law. However, Art. 102(c) requires a higher burden of proof than contract law. As a consequence, it is unsurprising that no case of royalty rate discrimination has ever been sanctioned in Europe as an abuse of dominance. While courts and economists generally agree that the ND prong is applicable only when licensees are similarly situated, to date, there is no common understanding of the meaning of this expression. In particular, it is unclear whether, and to what extent, licensees are similarly situated if they are not competitors in the downstream market.",2021,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1

DON'T CITE FUNK,; ,"For patent eligibility the Supreme Court continues to rely on its 1947 opinion in Funk Brothers Seed v. Kalo Inoculant. It is one of the most cited cases for patent eligibility and the Supreme Court relies heavily upon it. It forms one of the foundations of the current eligibility test in Mayo v. Prometheus. This article argues that this reliance is in error. Funk is just not appropriate for modern patent eligibility. Interestingly this view is not new. Ever since its appearance in Flook, the Supreme Court's use of Funk has been dogged by criticism that faults the Court for improperly using an obviousness case for subject matter eligibility purposes. The Court has noted these criticisms but has flatly dismissed them. The critiques persist but they have remained a minority view in the patent academy. This article argues that the critics have had it right all along but that they have not gone far enough. Funk is indeed an obviousness case but that alone has not been sufficient. The missing link is an argument about statutory interpretation. What has not been fully appreciated is that the 1952 Patent Act changed the meaning of the patent eligibility statute. Curiously, this is true even though the literal text of the provision did not change. But once that change is understood, it becomes clear that not only is Funk an obviousness case but more importantly it cannot be a patentable subject matter case. When properly understood, the answer is clear. The Court should no longer cite Funk for patent eligibility.",2023,Government & Law,1
The dark side of weakening shareholder litigation rights: Evidence from green patenting activities,Shareholder litigation; Green innovation; Climate risk; managerial entrenchment; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; AGENCY COSTS,"Exploiting the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws as a quasi-natural experiment and the difference in difference approach, we find that US firms in states that adopted UD laws reduced their green innovation output and quality relative to their counterparts. Moreover, the causal relationship is more pronounced for firms that had better external governance before the adoption of UD laws. We also document that firms' information asymmetry dramatically increases after UD laws enforcement. Overall, our study reveals the negative consequences of weakening shareholder rights on social welfare outcomes like environmental innovation productivity.",2022,Business & Economics,1
"Previous and Prospective Career Mobility, Client Capture, and Compromised Professional Judgment: The Withholding of Known Relevant Prior Art by Patent Lawyers on Behalf of Their Clients",occupations and professions; patents and intellectual property rights; archival research; extant data; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; EMPLOYEE MOBILITY; REVOLVING-DOORS; AGENCY THEORY; FIRM; ECONOMICS; CITATIONS; INDUSTRY; MODELS; COSTS,"Client capture is the process by which professionals become so dependent on certain clients that their professional judgment is compromised. We explore whether there are systematic differences across professionals in their likelihood of improperly biasing their judgment in the interests of clients on whom they highly depend. To do so, we examine the disclosure of prior art by patent lawyers when representing client patent applications submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Lawyers are obligated professionally to disclose all relevant prior art of which they are aware even if, in doing so, their clients receive narrower intellectual property rights. We suggest that patent lawyers are generally more dependent on clients with whom they repeatedly engage and when they have numerous similar clients. We find, however, that the influence of such dependency on lawyers' withholding prior art is greater when they have entered the legal profession through a regulatory employment revolving door. Specifically, regulatory experience as a USPTO patent examiner provides patent lawyers with unique insight that enables them to compromise their judgment on behalf of clients on whom they depend. Further, patent lawyers who are associates in their law firms are more inclined than are partners to withhold prior art on behalf of clients with whom they repeatedly engage. Because associates' employment with their professional service firms is relatively insecure, compromising their professional judgment on behalf of clients with whom they repeatedly engage is more alluring in their efforts to enhance future employment prospects.",2020,Business & Economics,1
Taking Monsanto to court: legal activism around intellectual property in Brazil and India,Seed activism; legal activism; intellectual property; GM crops; Brazil; India; PLURALITY; FARMERS; RIGHTS,"This article analyzes legal disputes involving Monsanto's patents and royalties for Roundup Ready soybeans, Bt cotton and Bt eggplant in two important GM-crop producing countries. It argues that Monsanto implemented private royalty collection systems adapted to the specificities of crops and agrarian conditions in Brazil and India. The corporation thus enjoyed in practice the same extraordinary degree of IP rights in these countries as in the United States irrespective of significant differences between patent and plant variety laws of both countries and the US. NGOs and farmers' movements played a key role in drawing public attention to these issues while challenging the legality of the patents and royalty collection systems.",2020,Anthropology; Development Studies,1
The construction of patent claims,intellectual property law; patents; claims construction; Coase theorem; ,"This paper highlights two recurring facets of the way UK courts approach the construction of patent claims: the adoption of methods typically applied to the interpretation of contracts and the recognition that immaterial variations not expressly claimed nevertheless fall within the scope of protection. Drawing on the normative implications arising out of Ronald Coase's paper on the problem of social cost, this paper argues that the patent system operates as a substitute for an explicit bargain between economically active entities operating in the market under which a duty is accepted by one party in return for acceptance of a burden of risk by the other. This perspective incorporates both the static costs and the dynamic benefits of the system and accords with the monopoly-profit-incentive theory most commonly advanced in support of the patent system. It is shown how the contemporary approach to claims construction is supported by the object of giving effect to the presumed intentions of the parties to this hypothetical bargain and that this underpins both the implication of terms which go beyond those expressly agreed to by parties to a contract and the construction of patent claims so as to embrace immaterial variations not expressly within their scope.",2020,Government & Law,1
"Certified Repairable: Using Trade Marks to Distinguish, Signal and Encourage Repair",; INFORMATION ASYMMETRY; ECO-LABELS,"In today's throwaway world, a right to repair is increasingly important for environmental sustainability. As important as a legal right to repair - be that via patent, copyright or design - is the provision of information about the repairability of goods and a willingness and desire to repair the goods that we purchase. In this article we examine the way in which trade marks (and the sections on authorised use and control in the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth)) can be used to distinguish goods that are repairable and, in doing so, inform consumers that goods are repairable. Like the Health and Energy Star Ratings, Fairtrade and Forest Stewardship Council, a repairable trade mark can be distinctive and used to provide information, set standards and act as a simplifying heuristic to help consumers make a judgment and decision about which companies are repair friendly and which goods are repairable. In this way, the use of a repairable trade mark can play a crucial role in encouraging repair - creating a relational discourse in which intellectual property law, qua trade marks, help replace uncertainty and lack of knowledge with distinctiveness and an ability and desire to repair.",2020,Government & Law,1
Originality's Other Path,; COPYRIGHT; LAW; PERSPECTIVES,"Although the U.S. Supreme Court has famously spoken of a historic kinship between patent and copyright doctrine, the family resemblance is sometimes hard to see. One of the biggest differences between them today is how much ingenuity they require for earning protection. Obtaining a patent requires an invention so innovative that it would not have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art. Copyright, by contrast, makes no such demand on authors. It requires an original work of only minimal creativity. Except sometimes it doesn't. Puzzlingly, in some copyright cases dealing with musical arrangements, courts have demanded a patent-like level of creativity from putative authors. While these cases might seem like outliers, they have a pedigree that is both lengthy and largely unrecognized. The proposition that copyright originality should require patent-style inventiveness beyond artisans' everyday creations dates back to an 1850 music-infringement decision by Justice Samuel Nelson. In fact, only four months later, Nelson himself would author the Supreme Court patent opinion that is now credited as the touchstone for patent law's own nonobviousness doctrine. His corresponding vision for copyright, though, came first. Drawing on original archival research, this Article challenges the standard account of what originality doctrine is and what courts can do with it. It identifies Nelson's forgotten copyright legacy: a still-growing line of cases that treats music differently, sometimes even more analogously to patentable inventions than to other authorial works. These decisions seem to function as a hidden enclave within originality's larger domain, playing by rules that others couldn't get away with. They form originality's other path, much less trod than the familiar one but with a doctrinal story of its own to tell. Originality and nonobviousness's parallel beginnings reveal a period of leaky boundaries between copyright and patent, when many of the Justices considered a rule for one to be just as good for the other. Their recurring intersections, meanwhile, muddy today's conventional narrative about copyright's historic commitment to protecting even the most modestly creative works.",2021,Government & Law,1

Main path analysis for technological development using SAO structure and DEMATEL based on keyword causality,Main path analysis; Subject-action-object (SAO); Causality; Link weight; DEMATEL; MORPHOLOGY ANALYSIS; NETWORK; EVOLUTION,"Main path analysis (MPA) is a method for efficiently analyzing technological trends, which change rapidly in competitive environments. In general, MPA is based on citation networks, and it is used to derive the most key path in a complex network. However, the existing studies using MPA do not use important textual information of patents, except for citation data. In this paper, we suggest a new MPA based on patent documents to identify the main path of technological evolution. For this purpose, first, we used the subject-action-object structure to derive core keywords based on causal relationships in patent claims. Second, the DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique was applied to draw link weights between patents where causal relationships of keywords were reflected. Finally, a main path in a patent network was identified using the global main path and key-route main path analysis methods. In this paper, we collected and analyzed patent data related to self-driving car technologies, and we verified the technical changes in the main path obtained based on the proposed approach. We found that the generic technologies of the self-driving operation had the strongest influence on the other self-driving car technologies in the sensing-planning-acting steps.",2023,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,1

Patents filed by company founders provide accessible information on the appropriation of knowledge through the assignment of intellectual property rights (IPR). In this study, we developed a new database of patents and publications by the founders of European, drug originating biotech companies that reached IPO between 2013 and 2018. The founders' scientific human capital was analysed. We also developed a regression model to estimate whether the founders' career trajectories, previous publications and patent characteristics explain the appropriation of knowledge by biotech start-ups. Our findings suggest that founders' scientific human capital and professional experience influence the way in which knowledge is captured for economic use. Compared to patents filed by industrial inventors, those filed by academics and mixed career scientists are more likely to be assigned to an inventor's own start-up company than owned by a scientist's employers. These findings lead to fundamental questions about biopharmaceutical innovation regarding issues such as whether risks and returns are appropriately shared between actors in the public and private sectors.",2021,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,1

We explore federal policies, specifically energy policies such as Energy Policy Act of 1992 or 2005, that provide incentives for the development of environmentally friendly technologies in transportation. Drawing on a combination of qualitative and quantitative data, we construct and test several novel policy measures while controlling for other factors that may influence green transportation innovations. We develop a unique legislative timeline with the use of key-informant interviews, literature searches, and legislative updates reviews. Only one policy variable (executive orders) appears to have a positive effect on the number of patents in green transportation innovation sphere. High capital expenditures for pollution abatement decrease innovation activity, while high operating expenditures increase innovation activity. The federal policies over the time period analyzed seem to create uncertainty rather than provide a clear incentive for innovation. The executive orders may affect innovation levels; further tests are needed with the changes in political leadership. The results of our research note signal that stronger and more consistent incentives at federal level may be necessary to realize desired policy outcomes.",2021,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Ascertaining reasonable certainty for claim definiteness in US patents: An analytical framework,; ,"The Claim definiteness requirement for patentability is spelt out in 35 U S C 112 b. Supreme Court in Nautilus v. Biosig (2014) opined that the claim is definite only when it serves public notice function rather than just be insolubly ambiguous. This investigation traces the evolution of claim definiteness standard since the inception of the patent law and presents summary of cases decided by the Courts. Our analysis of claim definiteness litigations shows that the claims in unpredictable arts are more likely to be challenged for definiteness than those in predictable arts. The analysis further reveals that the Supreme Court in its Nautilus decision, restored the claim definiteness standard consistent with that mandated by the statute. Based on analysis of case-law, we provide a framework for PHOSITA to ascertain the definiteness of a claim under reasonable certainty standard. Re-analysis of cases based on insolubly ambiguous and reasonable certainty standard respectively, showed that Court's decision would have differed in only 4 cases out of 17 cases decided. The paper also provides guidelines to draft claims which will survive Nautilus standard and identify claims which could be successfully challenged for indefiniteness. Overall it would help in enhancing patent quality.",2020,Information Science & Library Science,1
A Politics of Intellectual Property Creating a Patent System in Revolutionary France,; RIGHTS; INVENTION,"Economic interpretations, in particular the lens of the Industrial Revolution, have strongly influenced our understanding of the rise of intellectual property. This article examines the political origins of the 1791 patent law in France, which is usually seen as the birth of the modern patent system in that country. Although calls to reform the Old Regime's privileges of invention were increasingly frequent as the eighteenth century wore on, only the French Revolution provided the ideological resources necessary for such a transformation. The revolutionaries did more than just adopt the procedures of English legislation, such as replacing prior examination with a registration system. I argue that the new patents (brevets d'invention) reflected the Revolution's image of the ideal society-a society built on natural rights, property, and the social contract, and made of rational inventors and an enlightened public. In France, more so than in other countries, intellectual property was the child of a political revolution rather than industrial capitalism.",2020,History & Philosophy of Science,1
Can green patents reduce carbon emission intensity?-An empirical analysis based on China's experience,carbon emission intensity; green patents; ARDL model; technology innovation; empirical analysis; CO2 EMISSIONS; DECOMPOSITION; CONSUMPTION,"Achieving peak carbon and carbon neutrality and designing energy conservation and emission reduction policies in China require giving full play to the effect of green technology innovation. This paper uses annual data from 1993 to 2020 in China, including the number of green invention patents and green utility model patents, and tests the long-term and short-term effects of green innovation on carbon emission intensity by constructing an ARDL model. The results show that the effect of green invention patents and green utility model patents on CO2 emission intensity is different. Specifically, green invention patents contribute to reducing carbon emission intensity in the short term but act as a barrier in the long term. Green utility model patents suppress carbon emission intensity in the short and long terms. In addition, adjustment of the industrial structure characterized by shrinking the secondary sector and developing the tertiary sector has the most excellent effect on reducing carbon emission intensity in the short term. The relative energy price's carbon emission reduction effect is weaker than the industrial structure. Foreign direct investment and non-fossil energy consumption increase carbon emission intensity in the short term. In the long term, increasing the proportion of non-fossil energy is crucial to reducing carbon emission intensity. The carbon emission reduction effect of energy price is insignificant, and foreign direct investment is not conducive to carbon emission reduction. Finally, this paper analyzes the policy implications of the empirical results and proposes recommendations for reducing China's CO2 emission intensity accordingly.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Investigation of the stability and risks of fomite transmission of human coronavirus OC43 on leather,human coronavirus OC43; stability; leather; antiviral; infectivity; TCID50; 229E,"Limited research exists on the potential for leather to act as a fomite of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or endemic coronaviruses including human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43; this is important for settings such as the shoe manufacturing industry. Antiviral coating of leather hides could limit such risks. This study aimed to investigate the stability and transfer of HCoVOC43 on different leathers, as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, and assess the antiviral efficacy of a silver-based leather coating. The stability of HCoV-OC43 (6.6 log(10)) on patent, full-grain calf, corrected grain finished and nubuck leathers (silver additive-coated and uncoated) was measured by titration on BHK-21 cells. Transfer from leather to cardboard and stainless steel was determined. HCoV-OC43 was detectable for 6 h on patent, 24 h on finished leather and 48 h on calf leather; no infectious virus was recovered from nubuck. HCoV-OC43 transferred from patent, finished and calf leathers onto cardboard and stainless steel up to 2 h post-inoculation (<= 3.1-5.5 log(10)), suggesting that leathers could act as fomites. Silver additive-coated calf and finished leathers were antiviral against HCoV-OC43, with no infectious virus recovered after 2 h and limited transfer to other surfaces. The silver additive could reduce potential indirect transmission of HCoV-OC43 from leather.Human coronavirus OC43 persists for up to 48 h on leather, suggesting that leathers could act as fomites for transmission of coronaviruses.",2021,Microbiology,1
Intellectual Property Court Rulings on Perpetuation of Evidence in Patent Infringement Cases in 2021: Observation and Suggestion,Intellectual Property Court; Patent Infringement; Prevention type; Confirmation type; Perpetuation of Evidence; ,"The intangible nature of the intellectual property has an incentive that encourages infringement. Comparing with tangible property rights, the public domain feature thereof also results in the difficulty of noticing an infringement. It is especially so in the situation of industrial division of labor, where infringement facts and evidence are often controlled by infringers. This has led to a relatively low success rate of patent infringement claims and an unsatisfactory compensation amount. Due to the restricted access of patent infringement facts and evidence, the phrase evidence tends to support one side has become a common phenomenon in the contemporary industry environment. In addition, the fact that the number of patent cases account for 70% of cases heard by the intellectual property court also points out the importance of the perpetuation of evidence ( alternatively known as preservation of evidence). Therefore, this article has analyzed the intellectual property court's related judgments made in 2021 to summarize the practical situation of the year, analyze related motion requirements based on different themes, and then make suggestions on practical operations and a direction of making amendments to laws.",2023,Government & Law,1
Excessive Pricing of Pharmaceuticals in the EU: Balancing between Exploitation and Exploitative Abuse,balancing competition law; EU; exploitative abuse; pharmaceuticals; patents; ,"Normally, after the end of the exclusivity period offered by patents, medicines fall in public domain attracting competing companies to launch generic production that would bring down price levels. for different reasons, generic production of off-patented medicines does not always take place, allowing the main producer to continue dictate price levels. under some circumstances, this conduct may turn into exploitative abuse. However, excessive pricing itself is not anti-competitive unless other cost-and non-cost-related factors are present that turn excessive pricing a concern of competition law. The article analyses the most relevant EU case-law on abusive pricing in the pharmaceutical sector questioning what the right benchmark price is in the light of the United Brands two-limb test. As economic calculations cannot provide universal solutions in these cases, the article suggests that the United Brands test should not be the only method to judge exploitative abuse, but rather a combination of different methods that need to be applied to achieve reliable results. As emphasised in several cases, both economic calculations and other factors should be considered to avoid the risk of false-positive results. furthermore, exploitative abuse exists only in case excessive pricing is additionally unfair. However, judging unfairness, as discussed in this article, is a complicated task where the outcomes depend on the impact of the test results on the competition process.",2020,Government & Law,1
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Flexibilities and Public Health: Implementation of Compulsory Licensing Provisions into National Patent Legislation,intellectual property; patent; public health; ,"Context: The protection of intellectual property (IP) rights, given international legal effect through the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of IP Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, has long been a contentious issue. In recent years, the long-standing debate on IP rights as a barrier to the access of affordable medicines has been heightened by the global vaccine inequity evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The TRIPS Agreement contains a number of flexibilities that WTO members can exploit in order to accommodate their policy needs. Among these is the mechanism of compulsory licensing, whereby patent licenses may be granted without consent of the patent holder in certain circumstances. TRIPS Article 31bis created a special mechanism for compulsory licenses specifically for the export of pharmaceutical products to countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity.Methods: We analyzed domestic patent legislation for 195 countries (193 UN members and two observers) and three customs territories. We analyzed patent legislation for provisions on compulsory licenses, including those defined in Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement.Findings: We identified 11 countries with no patent legislation. Of the 187 countries with domestic or regional patent laws, 176 (94.1%) had provisions on compulsory licensing and 72 (38.5%) had provisions implementing TRIPS Article 31bis.Conclusions: The results of this study have highlighted the gap in the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities in countries' national patent legislation, especially in least-developed countries. Although it will not fully solve patent barriers to the access of medicines, implementation of compulsory licensing (and specifically those for the import and export of pharmaceutical products) will provide governments with another tool to safeguard their population's public health. Further discussions are needed to determine whether the WTO can provide effective responses to future pandemics or global crises.",2023,Health Care Sciences & Services,1
Negative-Emission Technologies and Patent Rights after COVID-19,intellectual property and patents; compulsory licensing; march-in rights; geoengineering; negative-emission technologies (NETS); carbon-dioxide removal; biomass energy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS); direct air capture (DAC); INNOVATION; ANTITRUST; ACCESS; PRICE; CO2,"Governmental and particularly private funding has recently and dramatically expanded for both BECCS and DAC technologies. This funding and the associated research, development, and deployment efforts will generate intellectual property rights, particularly patent rights in NETS. As with access to medicines, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted concerns that patent rights may incentivize RD&D at the cost of affordable access to the relevant technologies. Further, access may be restricted to particular countries based on sovereignty concerns to seek preferential supply agreements through up-front funding. As a result, nations will likely turn to controversial ex-post measures, such as compulsory licensing, to assure access and to control prices of the needed technologies. The same concerns with patent rights likely will affect RD&D of NETS. Although international ex-ante measures exist (such as patent pools) which would help to minimize these concerns, such measures may not induce the requisite voluntary contributions, or may fail to materialize due to political disagreements. Focusing on both US law and international developments, this article proposes various ex-ante measures that can be adopted by national governments and private funders to minimize the likely forthcoming worldwide conflicts that will arise over balancing innovation incentives for, and affordable access to, patented NETS.",2020,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Government & Law,1
Network dynamics of Chinese university knowledge transfer,Knowledge transfer; Network dynamics; University; China; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; RESEARCH COLLABORATION; SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; INNOVATION NETWORKS; PATENT CITATIONS; INDUSTRY; IMPACT; EVOLUTION; SCIENCE,"Social networks are increasingly considered to be influential in explaining the knowledge transfer process. Despite scholarly efforts to integrate knowledge transfer and social network research, we lack understanding on how knowledge transfer networks emerge and evolve. We draw upon resource dependency theory and inter-organizational networks and collect patent data of 42 Double-First Class (DFC) universities to study structural properties of the Chinese university knowledge transfer network over time. Our results point to the existence of an increasingly complex yet remarkably efficient network. Universities and co-patent collaborations emerge in the network and act as knowledge bridges between other universities. The network moves from an early-stage single-centered network to a mature multi-centered network through a power-law pattern. Such movement allows for an aggregation phenomenon to appear as oligopolistic communities emerge and rule the network. While knowledge is more easily shared and accessible within communities, their existence also brings along control over knowledge bases embedded in those communities. Key universities take central positions within the expanding network, which allows them to gain control and easier access to knowledge. It also hints that it might be difficult for other DFC universities to become key players in the network. On an inter-regional level, our findings point to steadily increasing knowledge transfer activity, which is key to overcome the underdevelopment of some Chinese regions. Overall, this paper contributes to our understanding on the theoretical connection between knowledge transfer and social network dynamics, on how universities evolve through knowledge transfer networks, and on how their embeddedness translates into knowledge control, knowledge access, and knowledge bridges.",2020,Engineering; Business & Economics,1
Effects of early patent publication on knowledge dissemination: Evidence from US patent law reform,Disclosure; Knowledge flow; Patent; Pre-grant publication; Applicant citation; Examiner citation; CITATIONS; IMPACT,"In order to assess effects of early publication of patent applications on the dissemination of the disclosed technological knowledge, this study examines the impacts of the 18-month pre-grant publication system introduced in the United States in 2000. It focuses on the variations of the applicant non-self-citations driven by the actual policy reform, unlike prior studies, after demonstrating that including examiner citations causes a systematic bias toward early knowledge flows to subsequent inventors. It finds that the citation probability rose significantly in early stage following the early publication, which shows that the reform accelerated knowledge diffusion significantly. Furthermore, the effect was stronger in the fields with longer publication lag before the reform (strongest in Computers & Communications, followed by in Drugs and Medicals). The reform looks to have helped inventors to recognize potential duplication and follow-on invention opportunities earlier. In addition, the publications of eventually abandoned patent applications, which had not been published before the reform, are found to have become significant new knowledge sources.

Constellation IP and environmental quality,Intellectual property; Low earth orbit; Patent; Satellite debris; Trade secret; O34 (Intellectual property and intellectual capital); Q53 (Waste management); L51 (Regulation and industrial policy); K11 (Property law); TECHNOLOGY; PATENTS; MARKET,"We consider optimal intellectual property (IP) policy when (1) firms embed 'constellations' of IP-patented, secret/non-patentable, and patentable-but-secret innovations-into products such as communication satellites operating in low Earth orbit and (2) an innovation may improve both product performance and ambient environmental quality. For instance, a materials science innovation by SpaceX that is shared via patent licensing could raise the technical performance of all satellites in low Earth orbit and at the same time reduce orbital debris. Traditional IP policy helps innovators monetize spillover technological benefits by combining patent licensing rights with the right of competitors to reverse engineer patentable-but-secret innovations. However, we show that when disclosure of an innovation also creates spillover environmental improvements, licensing policies that address only the technological knowledge spillover are inefficiently weak. We characterize the conditions under which private firms will hold secret more patentable innovations than are socially optimal. We then suggest implementable IP policies for jointly promoting technical innovation and environmental quality improvements.",2024,Geography,1
INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT OF THE PATENTABILITY STANDARD OF NONOBVIOUSNESS,; PATENTS; BIOLOGICS; DISCOVERY; DEFENSE; DRUGS,"Patents incentivize innovation, but the face of innovation has changed over the past several decades. Patent law is adapting to the radical growth of the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries, which produce drugs and biologics respectively. Research and development (R&D) in these fields is largely incremental-new products are often derived from existing products. However, patents do not protect obvious improvements, those that anyone skilled in the relevant scientific field could have discovered through predictable, routine work. The line between incremental R&D and routine, obvious improvements is difficult to draw. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board have become critical of incremental R&D, in turn discouraging what they find to be routine optimization. This Note describes the modern obviousness standard as it applies to the improvement of drugs and biologics and examines arguments for and against protecting incremental innovation. In light of these considerations, this Note argues that modern expectations for innovation should be updated and advocates for a stricter, narrower definition of obviousness that reflects the value of incremental R&D to the continued growth of the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries.",2024,Government & Law,1
Beyond the finish line: How losing in patent race drives post-race innovation,corporate governance; innovation; patent race; short-termism; simultaneous invention; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; AGENCY COSTS; CEO DUALITY; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; INVESTMENT; PERSISTENCE; INVESTORS; MARKET,"Research SummaryAlthough patent races of leading technology firms have garnered significant attention in the prior literature, it remains unclear how the outcome of a patent race affects subsequent firm-level innovation. Drawing on agency theory, we propose that losing a patent race drives firms to pursue more technological innovation than winning due to managerial concerns. To investigate the mechanism, we hypothesize that the positive impact of a lost race on a firm's innovation is more pronounced when more shareholders hold near-term investment horizons and when a CEO is less protected against the pressure of shareholders. By constructing a unique dataset of simultaneous patent applications, we find evidence consistent with the proposed theory.Managerial SummaryThis study explores the impact of a patent race on the subsequent innovation of leading technology firms. We find that losing firms tend to pursue more innovation after the race, surpassing the winner in terms of innovation. This finding is particularly pronounced when top managers are more pressured by the shareholders. Specifically, we show that the positive effect of a lost race is especially evident in publicly listed companies with a higher ratio of short-term institutional investors and where CEOs have less protection from shareholder pressures in the public market. This research underscores how a setback in a technology competition can act as a catalyst to change innovation dynamics among competitors at the technology frontiers.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Energy saving and climate change mitigation through improved thermodynamic efficiency,Second Law of Thermodynamics; Entropy; Heat Recovery; Thermonuclear Fusion; Climate Change; Climate Change Mitigation; ,"The second Law of Thermodynamics is fundamental in the analysis of thermodynamic cycles. It dictates that the conversion of heat to work is limited. It reaches an upper limit in a classical thermodynamic cycle, and such a limit is provided by the Carnot cycle, which is the most efficient. Motivated by a recent allowance of a patent to this author (U.S. Patent 10,079,075), the present study tutorially attempts to expand on the subject and shows that the efficiency can go above the Carnot efficiency, provided a novel cycle is used, and heat, rather than being discarded, is recirculated in the same engine used to generate work. The significant energy saving consequential to this finding and climate change mitigation are reported. (C) 2020 Physics Essays Publication.",2020,Physics,1
USING PEST ANALYSIS TO EXPLORE THE IMPACT AND MECHANISM OF CHINESE AND AMERICAN BREEDING PATENTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Agricultural science and technology; Breeding patents; PEST analysis; Neutral cognitive map; Breeding technology; ,"In recent years, PEST analysis and its application in decision -making has become a hot topic, and this paper proposes a new model of PEST analysis based on neutral cognitive map static analysis.The proposed framework consists of five activities, identifying PEST factors and sub -factors, modeling the interrelationships among PEST factors, calculating centrality measures, categorizing the factors, and ranking the factors.The results show that the impact factor of the US breeding patent on the development of agricultural science and technology has reached the level of interrelationship, and the uncertainty is included in the analysis. Using this model to analyze the impact of U.S.-China breeding patents on the development of agricultural science and technology, we ranked the factors according to their interrelationships and incorporated uncertainty into the analysis. The results showed that the impact factor of U.S. breeding patents on the development of agricultural science and technology reached 0.70, and the index of the Gross Agricultural Product (GAP) caused by patents was greater than 100.

However, a closer look at history shows that this notion is not tenable. James Watt had a clear vision of energy conversion and conservation. In his 1769 patent, he laid down the foundations for the first law of thermodynamics, which was published in 1774. Watt did not use ordinary language to express his thoughts, but rather drawings that visualized his ideas.

"'She Used to Doctor Us up Herself': Patent Medicines, Mothers, and Expertise in Early Twentieth-Century Britain",; NATIONAL-HEALTH INSURANCE,"This article provides much-needed new insights into how patent medicines could enhance maternal power outside of clinical environments in the early twentieth century. While historians have considered the maternal management of domestic health, the role patent medicine products played in this complex equation of authority and expertise has yet to be the subject of sustained historical analysis. Using oral history archives, memoirs, social commentary, and advertisements, this article demonstrates how the expertise that mothers possessed was multifaceted, with powerful spatial, temporal, and even commercial connotations. This influence was especially significant at a time when clinical environments were still largely dominated by men, when the home was increasingly invaded by experts and expertise, and when dependants of wage earners were not covered by welfare provisions such as the 1911 National Insurance Act.",2020,History,1
Factors affecting green innovation: An analysis of patent and regional heterogeneity,Green innovation; Shapley decomposition; Coast area; Inland area; DECOMPOSITION,"To achieve sustainable development, it is vitally important to identify the factors driving urban green innovation and evaluate the contributions of different factors. This study uses a Chinese patent full-text database from 2005 to 2016 to identify the number of green patents at the prefecture level and analyzes the main determinants that lead to differences in green innovation level in different regions and types, and their respective contributions by regression and decomposition. This study finds that first, China's green innovation level is characterized by unbalanced development among different regions - the coastal areas develop rapidly while the inland areas develop comparatively slowly. Green innovation output is polarized among different cities, and the trend is more severe in inland areas. Second, economic development acts as the leading factor influencing the overall green innovation output of China both in inland and coastal areas, factor input follows as the second influencing factor, while government behavior has a comparatively small impact on green innovation. Third, regarding green patents of different types in different regions, economic development still serves as the major factor of unbalanced output of all kinds of patents, and government behavior has a relatively obvious regional characteristic, whose impact on inland areas is more evident.",2021,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
DO FDI AND PATENTS DRIVE SOPHISTICATION OF EXPORTS?

In measuring export quality, sophistication of a country's export basket is utilized. Utilizing panel data of countries for the period 2002-2015 and applying GMM methodology, the results indicate that the level of financial development, the quality of human capital and globalization of a country have a determinant role on the relation between knowledge spillover channels and the quality of exports. Patent applications generally positively affect sophistication of exports.

Do social policies foster innovation? Evidence from India's CSR regulation,Innovation; Patents; R&D; CSR; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; EARNINGS MANAGEMENT; TECHNICAL CHANGE; COMPANIES ACT; RESPONSIBILITY; IMPACT; FIRMS,"We examine the effect of social policies on corporate innovation using India's mandatory Corporate Social Re-sponsibility (CSR) regulation. This regulation mandates firms with pre-tax profits above a certain threshold to spend 2 % of the profits on CSR. We demonstrate a significant bunching of companies just below the profit threshold post-regulation compared to the pre-regulation period. Firms close to the profit threshold manipulate their earnings to avoid compliance by increasing their R&D expenses. We show that, on average, firms that increase R&D expenses to avoid the regulation apply for one more patent and announce two new products. The increase in R&D expenses and patenting is concentrated in firms with a prior history of innovation. Our results suggest that social policies can generate indirect incentives for innovation.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Analysis of patents related to technology to combat bioterrorism and biological warfare,Biological weapons; Antiterrorism; Viral agents; Patents; HISTORY,"The use of biological weapons in terrorist acts is not a recent phenomenon. Since ancient times, several countries have experienced the devastation caused by the use of biological material harmful to human and animal health and the environment. In recent years, however, the imminent risk of bioterrorist attacks worldwide has reignited the debate on public policies to address this problem. In this sense, this study aimed to map and analyze patents related to combating bioterrorism and biological warfare, focusing on the virus as a biological agent due to its high intercontinental transmissibility. The method used for this consisted of structured searches in the Espacenet (R) database, resulting in 352 patent deposits between 1996 and 2021. The results showed that 41.8% of the deposits had companies as holders. It was also noted that the United States dominates the market for technologies to combat bioterrorism and biological warfare, with 61.4% of patent deposits made. The technological field ranges from the early detection and disinfection of pathogens to pharmaceutical compositions for treating people or affected areas. Thus, it became evident that efforts are being made to develop different technological solutions to prevent or neutralize the harmful effects of biological weapons used for terrorist purposes.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Patenting Genetic Information,; INNOVATION; AMPLIFICATION; BIOLOGICS; ECONOMICS; INDUSTRY; THERAPY; HISTORY; GENOME; IMPACT; PRICE,"The U.S. biotechnology industry got its start and grew to maturity over roughly three decades, beginning in the 1980s. During this period genes were patentable, and many gene patents were granted. University researchers performed basic research- often funded by the government-and then patented the genes they discovered with the encouragement of the Bayh-Dole Act, which sought to encourage practical applications of basic research by allowing patents on federally funded inventions and discoveries. At that time, when a researcher discovered the function of a gene, she could patent it such that no one else could work with that gene in the laboratory without a license. She had no right, however, to control genes in nature, including in human bodies. Universities licensed their researchers' patents to industry, which brought in significant revenue for further research. University researchers also used gene patents as the basis for obtaining funding for start-up enterprises spun out of university labs. It was in this environment that many of today's biotechnology companies started. In 2013, the Supreme Court held that naturally occurring genes could no longer be patented. This followed a 2012 decision that disallowed patents on many diagnostic processes. These decisions significantly changed the intellectual property protections in the biotechnology industry. Nevertheless, the industry has continued to grow and thrive. This Article investigates two questions. First, if some form of exclusive rights still applied to genes, would the biotech industry be even more robust, with more new entrants in addition to thriving, well-established companies? Second, does the current lack of protection for gene discoveries incentivize keeping such discoveries secret for the many years that it can take to develop a therapeutic based thereon-to the detriment of patients who could benefit from knowledge of the genetic associations, even before a treatment is developed? The Article concludes by analyzing what protection for discovering genetic associations, if any, will most increase social welfare.",2023,Government & Law,1

The same applies in the case of independent claims, in any event if their content is the same to such an extent that the implementation of one claim (for example, a claim to an apparatus) typically leads to the implementation of the features of the other claim (for example, a process claim). The defence of a patent in amended form asserted for the first time in the appeal instance is generally admissible under Sec. 116(2) Patent Act if the new application differs from an application already filed at first instance only in that individual features added to the granted version have been deleted (confirmation of decision of the Federal Supreme Court, 20 March 2014 - X ZR 128/12 para. 52).",2021,Government & Law,1

We use a quasi-exogenous regulatory shock to analyze whether improved governance helps to channel firms with powerful CEOs toward more value-enhancing corporate policies. We use the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and NYSE/NASDAQ listing rules and focus on firms that were required to improve governance. We find that postregulation firms led by powerful CEOs increase innovation inputs (Research and Development expenditures) and produce more innovation outputs (patents) that are scientifically more important (citations) and economically more valuable (market value of patents). Investment quality also improves, manifesting in better takeover performance and improvements in firm performance and corporate value. Our results suggest that improved governance can mitigate value destruction in powerful CEO-managed firms. We take steps to mitigate econometric concerns and ensure our results are robust to various combinations of fixed effects and control variables.",2022,Government & Law,1
PRIOR ART IN THE DISTRICT COURT,; IRRATIONAL IGNORANCE; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; PATENT; ACCURACY; LAW,"This Article is an empirical study of the evidence district courts rely upon when invalidating patents. To construct our dataset, we collected every district court ruling, verdict form, and opinion (whether reported or unreported) invalidating a patent claim over a six-and-a-half-year period. We then coded individual invalidity rulings based on the prior art supporting the court's decision, observing 3320 invalidation events relying on 817 distinct prior art references. The nature of the prior art relied upon to invalidate patents is relevant to two distinct sets of policy questions. First, this data sheds light on the value of district court litigation as an error-correction tool. As prior work has shown, the public interest in revoking erroneous patent grants depends on the reason those grants were undeserved. Second, this data sheds light on the feasibility of discovering invalidating prior art during patent examination. Depending on the ease of finding the relevant prior art, it may or may not be cost effective to replace patent litigation with a different approach to error correction, such as investing more effort in examination-stage scrutiny. The conclusions here are mixed. On one hand, invalidations for lack of novelty bear many indicia of publicly beneficial error correction. Anticipation based on obscure prior art appears to be quite rare. When it comes to obviousness, however, a significant number of invalidations rely on prior art that would have been difficult or impossible to find at the time of invention. This complicates-though does not necessarily refute-the traditional view that obviousness challenges ought to be proactively encouraged.",2020,Government & Law,1

With the support of the local government, most of the ordinary universities have shifted attention to the transfer and transformation of intellectual property based on school-enterprise cooperation, hoping to seek more commercialization income as an extra source of income. Therefore, this paper aimed to study the current situation of university intellectual property, i.e. the reserve and distribution of transferable patents, discipline distribution of patents, and regional cooperation of university patents.Design/methodology/approachA patent database of 10 key universities in Henan Province of China from 2012 to 2021 was established. The evaluation indicator model by the Entropy method was conducted to reveal the interaction mechanism between quantity indicators, quality indicators, and value indicators. Based on the data analysis, the development direction of the discipline construction and school-enterprise cooperation for local universities was clear.FindingsThe findings indicated that the number of patent applications from ten key universities in Henan Province has been increasing rapidly over the years. The trend for authorized invention patents has remained relatively stable. Compared with the patent applications and authorizations, the growth of transferable patents was notably slow. The significance of strategic layout of dominant disciplines and related high-value patents was not appreciated enough by Chinese government and universities. There was a large difference of dominant disciplines between 10 key universities, and the patent level of each university was directly proportional to the number of dominant disciplines. The university patent level heavily relied on the researchers' contributions and the distribution mechanism of scientific research resources within the university. Guangdong Province and the Yangtze River Delta of China, being economically developed regions, exhibited the most active engagement in patent technology cooperation. Conversely, the central and western regions displayed relatively lower participation in high-value patent research and development.Research limitations/implicationsThis study can provide a unique perspective to understand and solve the financial bottleneck problem of ordinary universities in the central and western regions of China. The discipline construction and school-enterprise cooperation are just one of the existing schemes, but it still cannot solve the financial problems faced by local universities in China towards the government.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study can serve as a foundation for further investigation into policies aimed at improving the financial problems of ordinary universities in the central and western regions of China.Originality/valueAs an important attempt, the study tried to focus the financial problem of universities in the central and western regions of China based on the evaluation of the current situation of university intellectual property. This research findings are of great value in finding optimal layout between university patents, disciplines and school-enterprise cooperation.",2024,Business & Economics,1
The legal protection of new plant varieties in Algerian and American system,Algerian law; American legislation; innovation; legal protection-property right; new plant variety; patent; plant; ,"The importance of plants in almost all fields yields for a continuous international effort to determine the protection of innovations in plants, especially with the tendency of countries to make huge investments in this area. Though, most of the world's countries agreed to set-up effective protection for new plant varieties, they differ over the type and nature of proper legal protection. This discrepancy in international positions on legal protection frameworks leads the researchers to investigate the most appropriate legal adaptations of innovative new plant varieties; are they inventions or an independent intellectual property right? And what are the suitable ways to protect it? Thereby, a comparative analysis of the national texts with some foreign legislation has been conducted. The study structure is twofold. The first section dealt with the legal protection of plant varieties within an independent legal system: a study in the Algerian law, while the second one presented the possibility of protecting a new plant variety under a patent: a study in the American legislation. The results showed that the adoption of a patent protection system is of great importance. It is, thus, preferable for the legislator to approve the dual protection of new plant varieties.",2022,Government & Law,1
How Half-Causation can enlighten the drafting of patent claims,invention; patent claims; Half-Causation; Half-Causation Branching; HalfCausation Encapsulation; philosophy of technological discovery; philosophy of inventions and patents; philosophy of technology; ,"The author's 2019 article 'If You Wish to Invent Then Follow the Half-Causation Method' presented 'Half-Causation', which is a philosophical model for the systemization of the invention process. It consists of five phases of reasoning, each terminating with taking a 'logical branch'. This paper has two objectives. The first (and preliminary) objective is to introduce a readership in patent practices (and theory) to Half-Causation. The second (and primary) objective is to highlight how Half-Causation can be practically useful to patent practitioners (and perhaps ultimately theorists), specifically in terms of enlightening the drafting of patent claims. In order to do this effectively, the reader is presented with a case which they can engage with to see for themselves how Half-Causation can help, step by step. The presented case was the subject of the USPTO's 2019 patent drafting competition. It consists of rather convoluted instructions received from an 'imaginary' client about their 'imaginary' invention. The case is an excellent opportunity to illustrate how Half-Causation as a philosophical model can be practically useful. Two Half-Causation tools are implemented. The first is Half-Causation Branching, which allows the logical mapping of the inventing space, within which the imaginary invention is located. Implementing this tool reveals two alternative nearby inventions, which if left out of the sought patent protection would render any eventually granted patent practically worthless. Following that, Half-Causation Encapsulation comes to the rescue by allowing the encapsulation of the original imaginary invention, plus the two alternative nearby ones, all in a manner that provides the all-important unity of invention On the one hand, patent agents are not supposed to contribute to their client's inventive concept to the extent that they become co-inventors. On the other hand, scientists and engineers are not supposed to dedicate so much time and effort to learning about complex patent laws as to become patent agents. Arguably, each should aim to excel in their discipline. However, a structured dialogue should be considerably helpful to each and to the patent process as a whole. It is proposed that Half-Causation, with its logical structure, can provide a basis for such a dialogue. Besides targeting a readership in patent practices and theory, this paper should be of interest to multiple readerships, for example in engineering design, medical discovery and philosophy of technology.",2021,Government & Law,1

Biopriming seeds with these beneficial multi-trait microbes is an effective way to introduce them in the soil, and this is an example of bottom-up approach of rhizosphere engineering. Using such sustainable approach is promising and, to investigate and analyze, their research trends are of prime importance. Thus, data were retrieved using Lens and Scopus databases and used for patent landscaping and citation network analysis, respectively. For patent landscaping, documents obtained using customized keyword search were broadly from the past 35 years (1987-2022) and yielded 114 patents which were manually curated in title, abstract and claims (TAC). From the year 2000, interest in this area was observed which further gained momentum from the year 2008, and a maximum peak was observed in the year 2021. Patent profile (filed, granted and published) showed an upward trend during this tenure (1987-2022). In this research article, we aim to provide an overview of current research in this field, identify research hotspots, project future development prospects and make recommendations for further research. Patent landscaping and citation network analysis were used to analyze the recent trends in biopriming approaches using microbial bioinoculants for the first time to identify progress and hotspots in the field of seed priming with PGPRs.",2023,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,1
A Fast and Scalable Algorithm for Prior Art Search,Prior art search; graph traversal; citation network; document similarity; patent analysis; PATENT LITIGATION; COCITATION; RETRIEVAL; INFORMATION; SIMILARITY; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION,"Companies and research institutes are acquiring monopolized technologies through patents to survive in a rapidly changing market. The applicant is guaranteed by law the exclusive right to the technology for a certain period. A prior art search is an essential task for this purpose. Therefore, the need for a successful prior art search is increasing. Previous studies have disadvantages because relevant fields are limited, requiring an in-depth understanding of specfic technologies. This paper proposes a method to overcome these limitations using patent text and citation information. The proposed method searches for prior art using a citation network based on the shortest path derived from a breadth-first search. We examined based on experiments whether the proposed method could be applied to the industry. Based on the results, the proposed algorithm can efficiently search for prior art. Furthermore, it was possible to construct a counterstrategy based on the characteristics of the applicant. The code will be made available at github.com/lee-ju/k_step_PIC.",2022,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,1
The Multilateral Legal System under Globalization: The Conflicts and Co- Competition between the National Laws and Transnational Laws in Taiwan's IP Law and Legal System,"Globalization Trends; Knowledge based Economy; National Law, and Transnational Law; ","Without doubt, the trends of globalization have accelerated changes in politics, culture, and the socio-economic development from the industrial economy to the current knowledge based economy. There is no denying that the impact of globalization includes advantages and disadvantages at the same time. It is regrettable that the values of a multi-cultural society have been threatened by the mainstream view of globalization, and the sovereignty of national law is also facing boundary challenges and legal problems. Actually, Taiwan law is German-based civil law, so it differs from English-based common law. Obviously, in order to connect with international society, Taiwan law must comply with transnational laws under the globalization trends. All WTO Members are required to obey WTO regulations with regard to IP dispute resolutions; this includes Taiwan Patent Law's connection with transnational law, and the chapter of this paper explores the situation of Taiwan's legal system under globalization trends, in particular, the conflicts and co-competition between the national laws and transnational laws.",2020,Government & Law,1

Causation in Civil Law and the Problems of Transparency in AI,; LEGAL,"Although a number of European Union legal documents require AI to be transparent, this is frequently not the case. Such opacity can be attributed to a diverse range of causes, ranging from so called 'black box' algorithms, trade secrets and patents, to the cognitive barriers of non-professionals. Transparency, in contrast, is, in many cases, indispensable for establishing generic or specific causation in deciding civil law cases, especially within the scope of contractual or tort liability. Therefore, the concept of causation applied in various parts of civil law should be rethought, and some remedies for this problem should be adopted.",2021,Government & Law,1
"Comparative epidemiology and pathophysiology of patent and latent babesiosis caused by Babesia bigemina in buffaloes and cattle from different agroclimatic zones of Punjab State, India",Babesiosis; Buffalo; Cattle; Clinico-haematobiochemical; Prevalence; Low-lying areas; PCR; Punjab; India; ,"To conduct comparative epidemiology of parasitologically positive (patent) and polymerase chain reaction positive (latent) cases of bovine babesiosis in Bet Region (low-lying areas adjoining Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, and Ghaggar rivers of Punjab) of diverse agroclimatic zones of Punjab state in relation to haematobiochemical parameters as patho-physiological markers, blood samples from 783 dairy animals (487 buffaloes and 296 cattle) were analysed parasitologically by Giemsa-stained blood smears (GSBS) and by molecular-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting SpeI-AvaI restriction fragment of Babesia bigemina. We ruled out the endemicity of the disease with 2.17% patent and 3.96% latent cases of B. bigemina with significantly higher prevalence (P < 0.01) in cattle than buffaloes. The spatial distribution for a guideline to local veterinary practitioners and policy-makers indicated highest number of patent and latent cases in western zone and undulating plain zone, respectively. District wise highest prevalence of patent as well as latent infection observed in SBS Nagar of undulating plain zone showed substantial agreement (Kappa value: 0.70) between the two techniques. Haematology revealed marked microcytic hyperchromic anaemia in patent animals of group I (GSBS positive; n = 17) and latent animals of group II (PCR positive; n = 14) as compared to disease-free controls (group III; n = 10). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in group I in comparison to group II and group III indicated comparative pathogenic effect of babesiosis in patent cases. Though patent cases showed higher pathogenicity of babesiosis, diagnosis of latent infection is significant as it may act as source of infection for spread to other highly prone bovines.",2021,Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences,1
Eagle Pharm. Inc. v. Slayback Pharma LLC,; ,"The patent claims at issue recite a pharmaceutical composition comprising the active ingredient bendamustine and a pharmaceutically acceptable fluid comprising a mixture of polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol.'' The patent owner asserted that the claims would be infringed by a generic version of the patent owner's branded bendamustine product, Belrapzo. The proposed generic product comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable fluid comprising ethanol, not a mixture of polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol, and so there would be no literal infringement. The district court held that, as a matter of law, the ethanol-containing generic product did not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents either, because the patent specification disclosed that ethanol is a pharmaceutically acceptable fluid, but the claims do not encompass compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable fluid comprising ethanol. The court invoked the disclosure-dedication doctrine,'' which bars application of the doctrine of equivalents when a patent drafter discloses but declines to claim subject matter, [thereby dedicating] the unclaimed subject matter to the public.'' The Federal Circuit has held that by preventing a patentee from recapturing unclaimed subject matter, the disclosure-dedication doctrine reinforces the primacy of the claims in defining the scope of the patentee's exclusive right.'' The Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision to dismiss the case on the pleadings based on a judgment of noninfringement.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1
Employee health and corporate innovation: Evidence from medical cannabis legalisation,corporate finance; corporate innovation; government policy and regulation; labour economics; LONG-TERM ORIENTATION; MENTAL-HEALTH; WORK; CEOS; DISEASE; STRESS; LAWS,"We study the effects of employee health on corporate innovation by exploiting staggered medical cannabis legalisation across states from 1995 to 2020. Medical cannabis legalisation increases medical access, thereby significantly influences employee health. Using a difference-in-differences empirical design, we find that firms became more innovative after their states legalised medical cannabis use. In particular, we show that firms produced more patents, generated more patents with significant impacts, and attained higher patent value following the passage of bills to legalise medical cannabis. We identify a possible mechanism through which employee health spurs innovation: lower worker turnover. Lower worker turnover encourages firm-specific human capital investments and facilitates inter-generational knowledge transfer. Taken together, our findings support the hypotheses that medical cannabis legalisation improves employee health, overall well-being and their innovative capacities.",2024,Business & Economics,1

A feature of the database is the identification of trademark equivalents (or families) within and across national trademark offices. Equivalent trademarks are two, or more, insignias for the same product applied for by the same company. Unlike patents, the incentive to file for global priority is comparatively weak since legal priority for trademarks is territorial. To identify the number of true trademark equivalents we therefore create synthetic links using a neural network-based machine learning algorithm.",2020,Business & Economics,1

Using a panel of twenty-five OECD countries over 1995-2015, we estimated how domestic and foreign competition affects innovation. Reducing regulation intensifies domestic and foreign competition, increasing R&D expenditure and patenting. Accounting for interaction between these two sources of product market competition, we find that domestic regulation directly led to growing R&D expenditure and patent production, whereas competition from foreign regulation influences innovation toward its effect on domestic competition.",2022,Business & Economics,1

We study the influ-ence of design protection on price by exploiting cross-country differences in the scope of protection in the European automotive spare parts market: In some countries, repair parts are exempted from design protection, while in others they are not. Based on detailed price data, our difference-in-differences estimates imply that design protection increases prices by about 5-8%, with large differences between carmakers. We then link our findings to the literature on deviations from the law of one price. We document large cross-country price deviations for identical spare parts and provide evidence that a part of these price devia-tions can be explained by the lack of harmonization of design protection in combination with carmakers' pricing-to-market strategies.

The False Marking Gold Rush: A Case Study of the Private Enforcement of Public Laws,Civil procedure; litigation; intellectual property; LITIGATION; FEES,"Federal law prohibits deceiving the public by falsely marking an item as patented. The false marking prohibition has been enforced primarily by private lawsuits on behalf of the United States, with the party plaintiff and the government splitting the penalty. When a court decision dramatically increased the potential recovery for false marking claims, lawyers pounced immediately, filing more cases per week than had previously been filed in years. Indeed, many lawyers who did not previously work on patent cases joined the fray. Within two years, Congress eliminated this type of false marking suit and terminated all pending cases. Using empirical data, interviews with lawyers, legislative history, litigation documents, and news sources, this article tells the instructive history of false marking litigation. This history shows that the supply of private enforcement-lawsuits by private parties to enforce laws in the public interest-is sensitive to market forces. It also shows that, even when concentrated interests encourage Congress to cut back on private enforcement, Congress does not move as quickly as the bar. This matters because once Congress authorizes private enforcement, the maintenance of that system depends on judges and lawyers interpreting private enforcement statutes.",2024,Government & Law,1
Unsupervised technical phrase extraction by incorporating structure and position information,Patent text mining; Technical phrase extraction; Graph construction; Structure and position information; ,"The vigorous development of patent applications in recent years provides an opportunity to unveil the inherent laws of innovation, but it also puts forward higher requirements for patent mining technology. An essential step for patent text mining is to establish a technology portrait for each patent, that is, identify the technical phrases involved, which can be summarized and represented by the patent from the technical point of view. Currently, there is a large body of work focusing on keyword extraction. However, technical phrase extraction differs from keyword extraction due to the unique properties of technical phrases. Specifically, technical phrases must contain rich technical information and are essential to the entire patent text from a technical perspective. Meanwhile, finding potential relationships between phrases with different technical meanings is challenging for technical phrase extraction. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of technical phrases, we found that the position of technical phrases in the patent text and the structural relationship between technical phrases are crucial, and how to make good use of these two pieces of information is a challenge. Motivated by this, we propose a new Unsupervised Technical phrase Extraction model from the Structure and Position information perspective, named UTESP. Specifically, UTESP includes four key steps: candidate generation, graph construction, candidate score, and candidate selection. The structure information refers to adjusting the incoming edge weight of candidate phrases through the distance relations between candidate phrases and applying the graph ranking algorithm to obtain the structure score of the candidate phrase. The position information simultaneously incorporates the position and frequency of candidate phrases in the patent text to calculate a position score for candidate technical phrases. The effectiveness of our framework has been demonstrated by comparing with seven competitive algorithms on the patent datasets in terms of three evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1 scores. Besides, our new framework indicated significant improvements in the representation ability of technical phrases by comparing Information Retrieval Efficiency (IRE) with competitive algorithms.",2024,Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,1
"Rewriting Judicial History or Just Refilling Ink? Patents and the Right to Repair in Australia Post-Calidad: Logic, Simplicity and Coherence with Legal Principle Prevail over Rights Which They Have Held for More Than a Century",; ,"Where to draw the line between repair and remaking, and around the scope and character of both patentees' and consumer rights has been entertained recently by the Australian High Court in their consideration of Calidad. Until the Calidad litigation, there was little jurisprudence (and, with the exception of the conference on which this issue of this journal is based, few legal scholarly accounts), in Australia, as to what constitutes a repair of a patented product. Given the significance of the issues involved for the stakeholders mentioned, as well as in terms of competition law policy and principles, the decision is long overdue. At issue were a patentee's exclusive rights and the tensions therein with the capacity of consumers to repair a product they purchase (likely holding the assumption that such a use would not encroach upon a patent owner's legitimate interests), as well as the various secondary (or re-manufacturing/refurbishing) markets that have arisen both to supply a need (often in keeping with laudatory goals around recycling and repurposing for environmental reasons), and to profit from an opportunity in accordance with principles of demand, and, it follows, to keep costs of a product down. In establishing that Australia will follow the approach of the United States in particular with regard to what the majority refer to as the comprehensible and consistent doctrine of exhaustion of patents, over the previously dominant principle of implied licence (a shift that the minority decision- makers determine is a question for the legislature, not the courts and which they characterise as stripping patentees of rights long held), the High Court has provided much-needed certainty and clarity about a persistent conundrum within Australian patent law and its relationship to rights of repair.",2020,Government & Law,1

However, large-scale empirical studies on patent transfers, reflecting technology and knowledge sharing, remain limited. This study used social network analysis to investigate university technology flows in China based on patent assignments from technological, organizational, and regional perspectives. The results firstly revealed clear stage characteristics in the number of university patent assignments with the improvement of the Chinese version of the Bayh-Dole Act. Secondly, popular technologies in university technology flows mainly concentrated on measurement, testing, digital transmission, and other areas in which enterprises lack international competitive advantage. Thirdly, central actors comprised prestigious universities focusing on science, engineering, and comprehensive disciplines, along with intellectual property-focused enterprises. Finally, university technology flows gradually delocalized, and varied regional patterns exist owing to a spatial mismatch between university knowledge supply and regional demand. These findings have several practical and policy implications for government and university management in terms of promoting emerging technologies and clarifying universities' functions in regional and national innovation systems. This study contributes to the economic geography literature on regional innovation.",2024,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Inhaled nasopharyngeal nitric oxide concentrations during unilateral nostril breathing - A pilot study,Nitric oxide; Nasal airway; Nasal cycle; Unilateral nostril breathing; Congested airway; Patent airway; AIRWAYS; HEALTH,"The yogic pranayama technique of unilateral nostril breathing (UNB) has previously demonstrated improvements in language and anxiety in stroke sufferers, as well as reduced blood pressure and increased heart rate in normal healthy adults. The nose typically passes different amounts of air through each nostril with the greater amount of air passing through the 'patent' side, and a lesser amount through the 'congested' side. Each side of the nose periodically takes turns at carrying the dominant tidal air flow in what is termed the' nasal cycle'. The nasal sinuses are a rich source of inhaled nitric oxide, a colourless and odourless gas that acts as a bronchodilator, vasodilator, and neurotransmitter. Nasal derived nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to the benefits attributed to UNB. This investigation seeks to assess the influence the nasal cycle has on inhaled nasopharyngeal NO concentrations during UNB by comparing unobstructed bilateral nostril breathing to patent-side and congested-side UNB in healthy individuals demonstrating a nasal cycle. After determining the patent and congested nasal sides in healthy adult volunteers, and sampling air at both nostrils, nasopharyngeal inhaled NO concentrations were then assessed during normal nasal at-rest tidal breathing during three different nasal breathing states: first both nostrils, then allocated in randomised order, patent side only, and congested side with only UNB. Nasopharyngeal NO concentrations were found to be consistently higher on both exhalation and inhalation during congested side UNB, when compared with either unilateral patent side UNB or breathing through both nostrils.",2021,Physiology; Respiratory System,1

We find that stronger intellectual property (IP) protection has a sharper impact on the demand for managerial skill for technologically advanced firms. Firms that were a-priori above the industry median (in terms of technology adoption, more so for R&D expenditure) witness a rise in the share of managerial compensation by 1.3%-8.3% higher than the rest. This effect is completely driven by firms between 5-8th decile with no effect on firms below the median or at the very top of the technological ladder. This observed snail-shape in the firms' response to the IP shock is rationalized in a model where firms within an industry compete for patents by investing in managerial inputs. The observed increase in wage inequality can partly be attributed to a stronger performance pay for high-tech firms. Associatedly, high-tech firms invested more in technology adoption, started to produce more product varieties at higher quality, and filed for more product patent claims.",2022,Business & Economics,1

Joint innovation signals close partnerships. Regional proximity of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) to the European Union (EU) defines its research and development objectives. These objectives are additionally subjected to the USA's geopolitical strategy in this geographical area. Hence, CEE's limited resources require limited resources make international innovation cooperation. This paper aims to analyse whether and how CEE countries make international innovation cooperation decisions.Design/methodology/approachThis paper used Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) database of total patent applications filed to the patent cooperation treaty (PCT) with co-applicants from abroad, where co-patents with at least one foreign inventor present a measure of international innovation partnership. A vector autoregression analysis and impulse response function were used to analyse international innovation partnership choices of eight CEE OECD countries for the period 1990-2018.FindingsInnovation with the EU is of collaborative nature, commonly displaying complementary properties with the rest of the examined innovation partners, while co-patenting with the Russia and China act as substitutes or complements. Co-patenting with Russia is the most versatile, displaying both properties of collaboration and competition. Some countries exhibit complementarity in co-patenting activities with multiple partners. The significance levels of these relationships vary, indicating varying degrees of impact. Overall, these findings highlight the complex dynamics of co-patenting activities and the influence of different partners on countries' collaborative innovation strategies.Research limitations/implicationsIn addition to significant relationships, insignificant relationships as well as those that could bring about greater synergy are flagged in the paper. Those relationships portray possible direction into which national funds could be channelled to incite cooperation between different sectors and countries, especially as innovation partnerships are not always successful and require a long time period to materialise.Originality/valueBy examining bilateral innovation partnerships, this study provides an insight into the strategic political and economic spheres of influence in the CEE region.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Sui-Genericide,; LANHAM ACT,"Generic terms-those that describe a general class of goods or services-are not eligible for trademark protection. Firms have historically gone to great lengths to prevent their trademarks from becoming generic-a fate often referred to as genericide. But in a few rare cases, firms have voluntarily declared certain terms that they have created to be generic, a phenomenon that I refer to as sui-genericide. This Article explores the little-discussed phenomenon of sui-genericide, both its origins in government-sponsored programs of the mid-twentieth century and its most recent incarnation in the area of technical interoperability standards. Though the voluntary relinquishment of the exclusive rights conferred by patents and copyrights has been studied extensively in the literature, there has been comparatively little scholarly attention to such mechanisms under trademark law. This Article examines the potential effects of sui-genericide on producer incentives, follow-on innovation and consumer welfare, and considers some of the ramifications of incorporating a sui-genericide doctrine into the law. It concludes by recommending potential measures to enhance the legal recognition of declarations of sui-genericide. These include official consideration during trademark prosecution of consensus lists of common terms that are developed by broadly-representative industry groups and the creation of a presumption of genericness for terms that appear on such lists, together with international harmonization of this recognition.",2021,Government & Law,1

The analysis begins by providing a global picture with regard to the historic origin of intellectual property, exploring the reasons why China does not have indigenous counterparts to the western system of intellectual property rights protecting its traditional knowledge (including traditional medical knowledge) and stating the problems of transplanting western intellectual property standards in China. A discussion follows on how China, under foreign pressure, has made efforts to comply with the changing standards mandated by various international, regional, and bilateral arrangements related to intellectual property, with examples of the development of China's patent law. China's approach towards the protection of traditional medical knowledge in various international fora related to intellectual property is explored. Finally, there is a specific examination of the compatibilities between the western system of intellectual property rights and traditional medical knowledge in China, at the national and community levels. This article argues that the system of intellectual property rights does not easily fit with China's traditional medical knowledge because of China's unique cultural traits, distinctive historical context and wide ethnic, religious, and local community diversity.",2023,Government & Law; Legal Medicine,1

While studies have focussed on documenting these changes in industry, less attention has been paid to observe the trajectories of basic and applied research in universities. This work contributes to fill this gap by looking at the evolution of publicly funded research that has been patented by universities between 1978 and 2015. First, we adopt a critical perspective of the basic versus applied dichotomy and identify patents according to three typologies of research: basic, mission-oriented, and applied research. Second, we describe the evolution of these three typologies in universities compared to industry. Our results show that over the years, patents from academic research that was publicly funded have become more oriented towards pure basic research, with mission-oriented basic research and pure applied research decreasing from the late 1990s. These results complement and extend the literature on basic and applied research dynamics in the private sector. By introducing mission-oriented research as a type of basic research with consideration of use, the work problematises the basic and applied research dichotomy and provides insights into the evolution of academic research focus, offering a more complex picture of how university research contributes to industry and broader social value creation.",2024,Engineering; Business & Economics,1
The Problems with Trade Secret Protection/Overprotection in Asia,Trade secrets; Non-competition; Economic espionage; Mobility; Breach of confidence; PRINCIPLE; EQUALITY; ARMS,"Trade secret protection law has been an important complement to patent law and has gained increasing importance over the last three decades, not least in Asia. Major Asian countries are now at a crossroads, as some (Japan, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and China) are following the US approach to criminalizing trade secret infringement and imposing harsher penalties on economic espionage (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China). This paper identifies many of the problems associated with trade secret protection, provides indicators of the overprotection of trade secrets, and warns against its many side effects. It then points out the crossroads that Asian economies are now at and provides some suggestions for Asian jurisdictions to consider: basing trade secret protection on commercial realities, working trade secret protection in tandem with the patent regime, and learning from the German model of moderate criminal punishment for trade secret infringement and protecting employee mobility by limiting non-competition clauses.",2022,Government & Law,1
Stents as Bridge to Arterial Switch Operation for D-Transposition of Great Arteries Late Presenter,transposition of great arteries; bridge to surgery; ductal stenting; atrial septal stenting; ,"We report a 5-month-old infant with dextro-transposition of great arteries (D-TGA) with intact ventricular septum (IVS) who had low left ventricular mass index, small patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and stretched patent foramen ovale. The patient had respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The surgical intervention was considered very high risk. Thus, the patient underwent PDA stenting with balloon predilation technique followed by atrial septal stenting with false impression of dislodgement-pseudodislodgement because of inadvertent retraction of patent foramen ovale that was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography guidance. After the procedure, the left ventricular mass index improved and patient was planned for arterial switch operation. The combined approach of PDA and atrial septal stenting may provide potential nonsurgical method of ventricular preparation for D-TGA/IVS late presenter, acting as a bridge to arterial switch operation especially those living in remote areas.",2022,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,1
Deregulating Innovation Capital: The Effects of the JOBS Act on Biotech Startups,G32; G34; G38; K22; M48; O31; SOX SECTION 404; COSTS; CONSEQUENCES; INFORMATION; DISCLOSURE; DECISION; IPOS,"We examine real outcomes for biotech startups going public around the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. Reduced compliance costs associate with greater innovation capital formation as biotech IPO volume and proceeds increase after the JOBS Act. Biotechs, which conduct over 30% of IPOs since 2012, go public with products earlier in the FDA approval process and more frequently target rare diseases and cancer. Consistent with our survey evidence that managers use compliance savings to invest in R&D, we link the JOBS Act to post-IPO increases in project-level development, such as new patents, clinical trials, and staffing of laboratories. Post-JOBS Act product candidates are more likely to reach key milestones in the FDA approval process and these startups fail at lower rates. Benefits accrue to shareholders without sacrificing financial reporting quality. Our results demonstrate how tailoring regulations for startups can provide economic and societal benefits.",2023,Business & Economics,1
PATENTABILITY OF COMPUTER PROGRAM ALGORITHMS IN THE G20 STATES,algorithm; computer program; patentability; software patent; intellectual property; G20; BRICS; ,"Ubiquitous computerization and digitalization are contributing to the unprecedented growth of the software market. Computer programs are protected as subject of copyright law in international law and domestic legal systems. However, copyright law does not protect the interests of the copyright holder from borrowing ideas and algorithms which often have a great commercial value. This circumstance has prompted the legal science and law enforcement practice of the most developed states to justify the possibility of protecting computer programs and their algorithms. The leading states chosen for in this paper are the G20 states. The relevance of this choice is due to the following: 1) The G20 states account for 86% of global GDP; 2) All world leaders in computer software development are G20 members; 3) All BRICS states are G20 members; 4) The law-and-orders of the G20 states are relevant to all existing traditions of the legal protection of intellectual property in the world. The legal systems of the G20 states follow one of three approaches according to the criterion of patentability of computer programs and their algorithms. We call the first approach neutral. It includes States which legislation does not explicitly prohibit the patenting of computer programs, but computer programs themselves are not mentioned among the subject matters of inventions. The second (positive) approach includes those states which legislation explicitly classifies computer programs as patentable inventions. On the contrary, the third (negating) approach includes states where it is legally established that computer programs as such are unpatentable. The results of the research demonstrate that there is no direct correlation between the way of solving the issue of patentability of computer program algorithms in different legal systems and the state's place in the global IT market. For example, the United States and China take a neutral approach, Japan takes a positive approach, the EU Member States and India take a negating approach. We believe that the most flexible approach is a neutral approach from the point of view of patent law policy. The most liberal and consistent approach is the positive approach presented by the Japanese legal system. Finally, the negating approach is the most controversial and at the same time widespread among the G20 and BRICS states.",2022,Government & Law,1
PUTTING THE EQUITY BACK INTO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REMEDIES,; PATENT HOLDUP; LAW; LIABILITY; INFRINGEMENT; RIGHTS; ABUSE; UNCONSCIONABILITY; INJUNCTIONS; CUSTOM; RULES,"Within the realm of remedies, intellectual property remedies have presented particular difficulties, and in intellectual property law, controversy has focused on remedies. Concerns about holdup in intellectual property have even begun to lead to innovations in the law of remedies itself. Many of the difficulties and controversies raging now center around remedies that are equitable. In this Essay I argue that recovering a major function of equity- as meta-law-helps us understand these problems and to offer potential solutions. Meta-law is a higher order intervention when regular law fails, in contexts of high complexity and uncertainty, often stemming from polycentricity, conflicting rights, or opportunism. These problems are rife in intellectual property settings. An attention to meta-law can focus on potential two-sided opportunism in scenarios of possible injunctions, and a more traditional equitable framework can help frame when presumptions for injunctions are appropriate and when they should be overcome. Equity as meta-law allows us to avoid flattening the law of intellectual property remedies.",2021,Government & Law,1

The effect is moderated by two additional mechanisms, namely the retention of star scientists and the experience in upstream strategic alliances. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of 6208 USPTO patented technologies acquired by 350 biotechnology firms over the period 1980-2012. Findings reveal an inverted U-shaped effect of the pioneering nature of the acquired technology on firm's subsequent developments, in terms of (self) citations of firm's subsequent patents to the acquired one. Moreover, the main relationship is negatively moderated by the retention of star scientists, while the experience in upstream alliances demonstrates to be a positive moderator.",2022,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,1
Exploring the Evolution of Core Technologies in Agricultural Machinery: A Patent-Based Semantic Mining Analysis,technology evolution path analysis; agricultural machinery; patent mining; technology roadmap; LDA clustering; METHODOLOGY; SCIENCE; VISUALIZATION; INFORMATION; ROADMAP; BERT,"The semi-automatic construction and analysis of technology roadmaps are at the forefront of applying artificial intelligence techniques. To clarify the development path of the core technologies in the field of agricultural machinery, we propose a core technology evolution path analysis method based on patent text semantic mining. First, the key sentences in the text were extracted, and the BERT model was used to represent the topic's key sentences in semantic vectorization. Then, the technology roadmap was constructed through the unsupervised LDA topic clustering method, and the main fields of activity, blank fields, and fields of agricultural machinery were visually analyzed. Next, investment in research fields was strengthened. Finally, we mapped the technology roadmap and patent IPC codes and found that the evolution of core technologies in the field of agricultural machinery could be divided into the technology development stage, technology focus stage, and technology transformation stage; this allows us to analyze the evolution and integration of these core technologies. The internal laws of the technology evolution provide a reference for future research plans of governments, enterprises, and institutions, aiding in the patent portfolio planning by revealing the microlevel process of technology integration and the technological trends in agricultural machinery.",2023,Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,1

Validity in patent infringement proceedings - a new approach to transnational jurisdiction,jurisdiction; infringement; validity; bifurcation; territoriality; private international law; LITIGATION,"Validity is frequently raised as an issue in patent infringement proceedings, either as a defence or as a preliminary question. Where a court may hear a dispute in relation to infringement of foreign patents, whether the court could and should adjudicate their validity is controversial. This article examines five approaches to this matter. It concludes that none of these approaches is perfect and that there is a lack of evidence-based assessment as to their efficiency. It then moves on to discuss the similar jurisdictional segregation which occurs between validity and infringement at the domestic level in those countries which have adopted a bifurcation system of patents. It suggests that measures adopted domestically may shed light on the international conflict, and that courts should consider factors exceeding those ordinarily considered by international lawyers. A jurisdiction 'matrix' is proposed, aimed at providing a pragmatic solution. It grants the court on infringement the initial power to screen the likelihood of success of the infringement claim and then the validity defence, taking into account the accuracy of decision, expertise, chances of success, sound management of justice and deterrence of torpedo defences, before making a decision on validity jurisdiction.",2021,Government & Law,1
The economic case against licensing negotiation groups in the Internet of Things,antitrust law; standard-essential patents; patent licensing; licensing negotiation groups; monopsony; patent pools; PATENT HOLDUP; INNOVATION,"Competition policy generally prohibits coordination among buyers or sellers, especially coordination on price, price-related inputs, and output. In licensing markets for standard-essential patents (SEPs), it has been periodically proposed that this rule should be relaxed to permit licensing negotiation groups (LNGs), which is expected to reduce transaction costs and the purportedly 'excessive' royalties paid to licensors. Based on the economic structure and historical performance of wireless technology markets, this policy intervention is likely to degrade, rather than enhance, competitive conditions in the wireless, automotive, and other markets encompassed by the 'Internet of Things'. In the short term, LNGs would most likely result in a redistributive (not an efficiency) effect that shifts value from innovators to implementers in the technology supply chain without necessarily passing on cost-savings to consumers. In the medium to longer term, LNGs are liable to impose efficiency losses by endangering the viability of licensing-based monetization models that have funded research and development, promoted dissemination of technology inputs, facilitated entry in device production, and enabled business models across multiple industries. While LNGs may reduce the transaction costs of SEP licensing, the historical record shows that pooling structures can achieve the same objective at a substantially lower risk of competitive harm.",2022,Government & Law,1

For patent documents, it does not provide keyword information, which makes the keyword based technology prediction method have some limitations in revealing research content and hidden topics in specific fields. In order to better reflect the technical information in the patent, this paper combines topic analysis and social network analysis to study the development trends of gene editing technology. First, the patent data of gene editing technology is collected from Derwent Innovations Index. Secondly, text mining software is adopted to draw a network graph of topic words, combined with Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to construct a weighted adjacency matrix, and Social Network Analysis is used to obtain the degree of centrality of technical topic words. Finally, the technological trends of gene editing technology is explored by identifying the core themes of gene editing, highlighting themes and emerging themes, and some meaningful conclusions are also obtained. Based on the analysis results, this study finds that the development of gene editing technology is limited by factors such as ethics, law and cellular pollution. In addition, future research directions will be more inclined to optimize the safety and efficiency of gene editing technology.",2021,Engineering,1
Tracing the technology transfer of battery electric vehicles in China: A patent citation organization network analysis,Technology transfer; Battery electric vehicles; Citation organization networks; Patent analysis; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; POLICY; INNOVATION; EMERGENCE; EVOLUTION; INDUSTRY; COUNTRY; FLOWS,"Technology transfer is an active process in which advanced technologies are transferred between two different actors. In a fiercely competitive environment, the development and commercialization of new technology, such as battery electric vehicles (BEV), increasingly depend on technology transfer across organizational boundaries. To further explore technological transfer across organizations, it needs to combine the related information with patent citations. However, the existing literature usually ignores the diversity and difference of patent citations across jurisdictions. To close the gap, the paper takes the difference of patent citations into account. The paper gains an insight into the evolutionary pattern of BEV technology transfer across organizations in China by constructing multi-category citation networks. We find that the technology transfer networks are increasingly complex over time, but technology transfers between organizations are uneven. An important characteristic of technology transfer is that it follows the power-law distribution with a very long tail. More importantly, both large car manufacturers and new entrants play an important role in technology transfer, followed by top automotive suppliers, while the role of universities is limited. Our findings can help policy-makers or company managers better understand the evolutionary pattern of BEV technology transfer at the organizational level. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

"Patents and regulatory exclusivities on FDA-approved insulin products: A longitudinal database study, 1986-2019",; DRUG,"Background Insulin is the primary treatment for type 1 and some type 2 diabetes but remains costly in the United States, even though it was discovered more than a century ago. High prices can lead to nonadherence and are often sustained by patents and regulatory exclusivities that limit competition on brand-name products. We sought to examine how manufacturers have used patents and regulatory exclusivities on insulin products approved from 1986 to 2019 to extend periods of market exclusivity. Methods and findings We used the publicly available Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) to identify all approved biosynthetic insulin products. Individual products approved under the same New Drug Application (NDA)-e.g., a vial and pen-were considered as separate products for the purposes of analysis. We recorded all patents and regulatory exclusivities listed in the Orange Book on each product and used Google Patents to extract the timing of patent application and whether patents were obtained on delivery devices or others aspects of the product. The primary outcome was the duration of expected protection, which was determined by subtracting the FDA approval date for each product from its last-to-expire patent or regulatory exclusivity (whichever occurred later). We performed a secondary analysis that considered overall protection on insulin lines-defined as groups of products approved under the same NDA with the same active ingredients manufactured by the same company. We also examined competition from follow-on insulin products-defined as products approved with the same active ingredients as originators but manufactured by different companies (approved via a specific drug approval pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). During the study period, the FDA approved 56 individual products across 25 different insulin lines and 5 follow-ons across 3 different insulin lines. Thirty-three (59%) of the 56 products were drug-device combinations. Manufacturers of 9 products approved during the study period obtained patents filed after FDA approval that extended their duration of expected protection (by a median of 6 years). Approximately 63% of all patents on drug-device combinations approved during the study period were related to delivery devices. The median duration of expected protection on insulin products was 16.0 years, and the median protection on insulin lines was 17.6 years. An important limitation of our analysis is that manufacturers may continue to add patents on existing insulin products while competitors may challenge patents; therefore, periods of protection may change over time. Conclusions Among several strategies that insulin manufacturers have employed to extend periods of market exclusivity on brand-name insulin products are filing patents after FDA approval and obtaining a large number of patents on delivery devices. Policy reforms are needed to promote timely competition in the pharmaceutical market and ensure that patients have access to low-cost drugs.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,1
Patent Philanthropy,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; SOUTH-AFRICA; ACCESS; MEDICINES; HEALTH; POLICY; INNOVATION; PRICE; LAW,"As in previous global public health crises, such as the HIV epidemic, patents have presented a major obstacle to vaccine supply amid the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. Compulsory licensing and intellectual property waiver have been put forth as solutions. However, as this Article and other studies reveal, neither proposal alone can address global vaccine inequality with sufficient urgency. Nor would these measures significantly improve the capacity of developing countries to produce medicines and vaccines. This Article proposes the establishment of a Patent Philanthropy Initiative (PPI) to overcome the inadequacies of compulsory licensing and intellectual property waiver and equip the global community with better preparedness for future public health crises. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would be called upon to administer the PPI. Pharmaceutical companies owning USPTO-granted medical patents would be required to contribute 1% of their annual post-tax profits accrued from their patented medicines to the PPI. Such financial contributions would then be deployed by pharmaceutical companies to promote public health in the United States and abroad through transferring knowledge, donating medical products, constructing facilities, training professionals, and facilitating public health education. This Article defends the validity of the PPI against concerns that it would violate the TRIPS Agreement and the U.S. Constitution and discourage investment in medical innovation. It illustrates the PPI's economic and social functions in improving the capacity of developing countries to produce pharmaceuticals, and its ethical function in prompting pharmaceutical companies to accept greater responsibility for the protection of public health. These functions are discussed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",2022,International Relations; Government & Law,1

As such, universities are pressured to demonstrate returns on investments through tangible research outcomes. This study analyzed how university resources affect research productivity, using data from 95 4-year universities in Korea from 2009 to 2017. Explanatory variables were remuneration, performance-based payments, and expenditures on research, experiments, machines, and books. Research productivity indices were the numbers of Korea Citation Index (KCI) and Science Citation Index (SCI) publications, authored books, patents attained, and licensing revenue. Considering that research productivity measures are related, this study used a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model. The SUR model analysis showed that SCI, patents, and licensing revenue were correlated and resources differentially affected research productivity. Full-time faculty remuneration, performance-based payments, and research expenditure were significant variables in determining SCI, patents, and licensing revenue. Results of quadratic form regression showed that research productivity increased when full-time faculty remuneration increased, but these gains were limited by the law of marginal diminishing returns. However, the performance-based payment variable showed opposite results, reflecting the law of marginal increasing returns. Combined results will help universities set their strategic direction, efficiently allocate their resources, and promote understanding about university functions.",2021,Engineering; Business & Economics,1

I find that treatment firms' total debt-to-assets ratio and R&D spending increase by 18% and 9%, respectively, as the residual control over patents increases firms' incentives to innovate. These effects are more pronounced when ex ante holdup exposure is high. Furthermore, I find a positive marginal effect of asset complementarity as it limits the decline in employee incentives.

"VESTED RIGHTS, FRANCHISES, AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS",; UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS; PUBLIC RIGHTS; CONTRACT CLAUSE; JUDICIAL POWER; PATENT SYSTEM; PROPERTY; HISTORY; LAW; ORIGINS; OFFICE,"Modern courts and commentators have had trouble distinguishing the kinds of decisions that require judicial power from the adjudicative tasks that Congress can authorize administrative agencies to perform in the course of executing federal law. In a prior article (Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 COLUM. L. REV. 559 (2007)), I sought to explain traditional doctrines on that topic. For much of American history, Congress could authorize executive-branch agencies to administer and dispose of public rights belonging to the federal government or the people collectively, and Congress also could give agencies conclusive authority with respect to the administration of privileges that federal law gave private individuals or entities. But the political branches did not have similar sway over vested private rights. Only true courts could conclusively determine either that a private person had forfeited such rights or that the claimed rights had never vested in the person to begin with. In my earlier article, I referred to the category of franchises-special powers or perquisites that the government gave private people who, in turn, did something of value for the public. Because no one had a vested right to be granted a franchise in the first place, I lumped franchises together with privileges. That taxonomy may have influenced the Supreme Court's analysis of patents in Oil States Energy Services v. Greene's Energy Group (2018). But the story is actually more complex. In the nineteenth century, once the government granted a franchise, private rights normally were thought to vest in the franchisee. That idea affected constitutional doctrine with respect to a wide array of legal interests, including not only patents but also corporate charters, the power to operate ferries and toll roads, and more. This Article explores the concept of franchises and their interaction with American-style separation of powers. In the process, it illuminates historical understandings of the public/private distinction, unearths new evidence about the constitutional status of patents, and sheds light on the traditional roles of each branch of government.",2021,Government & Law,1
Protection of intellectual property and human rights during health emergencies: an assessment of the patent waiver proposal,COVID-19; Vaccine; Patent waiver; TRIPS; Compulsory licensing; Intellectual property rights; EXTERNALITIES; JUSTIFICATION,"Purpose- Several countries, such as South Africa and India, believe that intellectual property rights (IPRs), including patents, impede the efficient increase in vaccine production to inoculate the global population as they scramble to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Their proposal at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to waive these pharmaceutical patents has been met with resistance from a few developed countries, who believe that the abrogation of IPRs is unnecessary, even during a pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the impact of a potential waiver of medical patents at the WTO versus the status quo of IPR laws in the global economy.Design/methodology/approach- This study examines key arguments from economic and moral standpoints regarding the provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and other related international agreements and their validity based on the premise of the internalisation of positive externalities posed by vaccines.Findings -The effectiveness of the TRIPS agreement in securing medical access is weak on account of the ability of profit-making multinationals to secure IP rights and on account of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral agreement that supports patent evergreening and a period of protection on test data which challenges the access to medicines and the fundamental human right to health.Originality/value-This study examines international IPRs through the lens of human rights and proposes a new system that balances the two.",2024,Health Care Sciences & Services,1
Analysis of the Patent of a Protective Cover for Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs): Simulations of Wind Flow,vertical-axis wind turbine; hemispherical cover; power generation; extreme wind conditions; computational fluid dynamics; SAVONIUS ROTOR; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; IMPROVEMENT,"This paper presents a numerical and experimental analysis of the patent of a device to be used in vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) under extreme wind conditions. The device consists of two hemispheres interconnected by a set of conveniently implemented variable section ducts through which the wind circulates to the blades. Furthermore, the design of the cross-section of the ducts allows the control of the wind speed inside the device. These ducts are intended to work as diffusers or nozzles, depending on the needs of the installation site. Simulations were performed for the case of high-speed external wind, for which the ducts act as diffusers to reduce wind speed and maintain a well-functioning internal turbine. Four different patent designs were analyzed, focusing on turbine performance and generated power. The results indicate that the patent allows the generation of electric power for a greater range of wind speeds than with a normal wind turbine. The results support that this patent may be a good alternative for wind power generation in geographic areas with extreme weather conditions or with maintained or strong gusty wind. Experimental tests were carried out on the movement of the blades using the available model. Finally, the power curve of the model of this wind turbine was obtained.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

This article explores the deficiency in clean technology diffusion caused by the legal fragmentation and rule complex of international environmental law and intellectual property law. It systematically examines three pathways to foster international clean technology diffusion through: restriction of intellectual property, including imposing external restraints in environmental law; striking internal balancing in maximizing TRIPS flexibilities; and keeping the status quo. It argues that treaty pathways may not work, and an operable pathway to promote clean technology diffusion is to maximize and consolidate TRIPS flexibilities in national laws. This option challenges the popular proposal of a Doha-like declaration on TRIPS and climate change due to the paralyzed multilateral trade mechanism, asymmetrical negotiation power of developing countries, prolonged negotiation process, and categorization problem in treaty negotiations.",2022,Government & Law,1
Assessing the symmetric and asymmetric impact of technological innovations environmental quality in Qatar,Technological innovation; Patent; Trademark; GDP; Environment quality; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; RENEWABLE ENERGY; EMISSIONS,"A significant contribution is made by technological innovation toward economic prosperity and the growth of societies. But this growth is associated with significant risks to the environment and creates a strong impact on environmental quality. In view of rising environmental concerns accompanied by technological innovation, this research is conducted to estimate the carbon footprint of technological innovation in Qatar by taking annual time series data from 2012 to 2022. The application of the linear ARDL model, assuming that technological innovation has a symmetric effect on carbon emissions, was utilized to predict the influence of two important factors, namely patent and trademark applications, on carbon emissions. The findings of the analysis indicated that in the long term, patent applications have a noteworthy positive impact on carbon emissions, although it is of a moderate nature. Conversely, there is a significant negative impact of trademark applications on carbon emissions. This result bears well with regard to environmentally sustainable growth in Qatar as the number of trademark applications is substantively more than patent. The asymmetrical NARDL model confirms these results, it was shown that there is symmetrical effect created by patent on carbon emission in the long run in terms of direction and magnitude. This implies that in the long run, there will be a significant effect (increasing or decreasing) on carbon emissions resulting from the positive or negative shock to the patent. While the association between carbon emissions and trademark remains symmetrical in the long run with respect to direction and magnitude acts here as more of a robustness test, confirming that environmental quality in Qatar will be improved by positive or negative shocks to the trademark.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

This Article provides a holistic framework for promoting socially responsive innovation that increases the social benefits, decreases the social harms, and improves the distributional effects of massive investments in science and technology. Traditionally, policymakers have relied significantly on centralized governance regimes such as mission-based science funding and technological regulation to guide the development and use of new innovations. While valuable, centralized approaches feature several shortcomings, and this Article proposes a distributed model of innovation governance to supplement them. In so doing, it draws on the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which bolstered the National Science Foundation's longstanding practice of considering the broader social impacts of proposed research projects when awarding research grants. Building on these reforms, this Article proposes a model of distributed innovation governance that extends beyond central policymakers to confer greater authority to promote socially responsive innovation on a wide range of public and private stakeholders, peer reviewers, scientists, and engineers. This Article argues for orienting various innovation gatekeepers-including federal funding agencies, scientific journals and conferences, and the Patent and Trademark Office-toward considering the broader social impacts (not just technical merit) of innovative projects when awarding key resources. By tying research funds, publication and presentation opportunities, and patents to assessments of social impact, this proposal creates a powerful incentive for scientists and inventors to consider and improve the contributions of their work to social welfare. This Article shows how government action can shift norms in the innovative community-including among private actors-to embrace socially responsive science and technology. This distributed governance model offers several benefits, including preserving scientific autonomy, guarding against the overpoliticization of innovation policy, and exploiting significant amounts of private information distributed among scientists and engineers.",2024,Government & Law,1
The case of sleeping beauties in nanotechnology: a study of potential breakthrough inventions in emerging technologies,O340; BAYH-DOLE ACT; PATENT CITATIONS; CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES; ACADEMIC PATENTS; KNOWLEDGE FLOWS; NANO-SCIENCE; NANOSCIENCE; UNIVERSITY; TIME; TERMS,"This study aims to determine whether innovation depends on long-term patterns of interactions in technology and science, using patents in nanotechnology. The previous literature has distinguished between a technology's degree of novelty (science-base) and degree of technological impact, highlighting that links to the science-base will lead to more breakthrough inventions, due to distant recombinations. We extend the debate by distinguishing two types of science linkages, direct and strong science-base and indirect and more diverse science-base. To find long-term patterns, we developed an empirical strategy to study nanotechnology patents through the metaphor of sleeping beauties, e.g., delayed recognition and high impact. We show that sleeping beauties occur more frequently in nanotechnology than in the general population of patents, so nanotechnology is an emerging technology that may delay breakthrough inventions. As expected, both types of science linkages create a higher impact. Contrary to expectations, however, neither direct and strong science-base (proxied by university ownership) nor indirect and more diverse science-base (proxied by the non-patent literature) are significant. Although this emerging technology has many science linkages, these do not cause a delayed impact. Control variables of IPC application class and company ownership do matter. We conceptualize that these are typical characteristics when firms combine several technologies for industrial innovation. Among other contributions, we propose that the non-patent literature should not be considered a proxy for science linkages in general, but instead this reflects a search amongst various types of codified as well as informal technological and scientific knowledge. We suggest that the long-term patterns of delayed recognition and high impact in science-based technologies may require the firms to recombine multiple technologies, specializations, and industrial applications in order to do industrial invention.",2022,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration,1

A unit root test and an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model were applied to avoid bias caused by data mismatch and autocorrelation of time series data. Elasticity long-run test shows that renewable energy consumption, exports, and gross domestic product have a positive impact on CO2 emissions, while foreign direct investment acts negatively on CO2 emissions. Depending on the error correction term test, there is a long-run causality: from CO2 emissions, renewable energy, foreign direct investment, exports, and gross domestic product to home patent. Findings of the short-run causality show that there is a unidirectional causality running from exports to CO2 emissions and from exports to gross domestic product. Our results also show that Tunisia should encourage foreign direct investment because it seems to be an important factor in the mitigation of CO2 emissions.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

Enacted in 1994 as one of the founding pillars of the World Trade Organization, TRIPS has enabled pharmaceutical companies to enforce their patent rights in almost every country, precluding cheaper generics from being distributed, save for very limited exceptions.But in 2001, TRIPS was amended expressly to address this issue, allowing countries with limited resources to lodge a formal request to obtain patented medicines at a sustainable cost. Generics manufacturers worldwide can answer this call, operating under the protection of a special export compulsory license that shields them from claims by the patent holder. And yet, this mechanism has been successfully utilized only once.In this Article, we explain why export compulsory licenses have failed and suggest reforms that would help fulfill their promise. First, we identify and analyze the factors that deter countries from making recourse to export compulsory licenses. Second, we argue that the only way for nations to use the current legal framework effectively is to act jointly through pooled procurement initiatives. Finally, we advance the view that TRIPS reform is necessary to unlock the potential of export compulsory licenses, proposing targeted amendments and explaining how these revisions would bolster the flow of patented pharmaceuticals from the Global North to the Global South.",2023,Government & Law,1

Drawing on patent transfer data, we modeled intercity technology transfer networks in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, a city region special for its one country, two systems structure, in the periods 2007-2011 and 2012-2016. We then explored the evolutionary characteristics of the networks and further examined the impact of, and interaction between, different forms of proximities in relation to technology transfer over time. Our results show that some kinds of proximities (institutional, cognitive, and social) are able to promote technology transfers, while others (geographical and cultural) do not exert significant impacts. Of the latter category, geographical proximity can, however, indirectly affect technology transfer by acting on the proximity of other dimensions (institutional, cognitive, and social). For instance, cognitive proximity can compensate for the lack of geographical proximity and social proximity frequently accompanies geographical proximity-and both relationships are reinforced over time. In contrast, the interrelatedness of geographical and institutional proximities have transformed from a relation of substitution to complementarity.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,1

The Article discusses, among other matters, the Second Circuit's recent decision in Castillo v. G&M Realty L.P., affirming a $6.75 million award of statutory damages for the infringement of artists' moral rights in graffiti art; the European Union's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive and its 2016 Liffers decision, which appear to require member states to award, where warranted, noneconomic (moral prejudice) damages across the full range of IP cases; and some recent arguments in favor of awarding damages for emotional harm in, even, patent infringement actions. Prompted by these and other developments, I argue that courts should recognize reputational harm as a potentially cognizable injury throughout all of the branches of IP law but that damages for emotional harm should be limited to right of publicity and moral rights matters. In addition, I discuss the various options for providing monetary relief in response to noneconomic harm, including awards of general damages, statutory damages, disgorgement of the infringer's profits, and enhanced or punitive damages; and I conclude with a set of recommendations for crafting awards in a manner that would both vindicate the relevant, cognizable interests of plaintiffs while reducing the risks of arbitrary, uncertain, and potentially overdeterrent relief.",2021,Government & Law,1

Many solutions are recommended to foster the integration of research and development, and intellectual property such as recycling, water cleaning, treatment of poisonous exhausted air, energy saving, green technology for conserving ecosystems. To have more inventions and patents, Vietnam needs to protect its intellectual property rights (IPRs) involving all its various sectors and entities more. However, the current status of IPRs protection in Vietnam shows limitations in this field due to lack of appropriate legal rules on civil and criminal sanctions. This article will give an overview of IPRs protection in Vietnam and then analyze some current provisions relating to civil and criminal sanctions for IPRs infringement based on the experiences of some foreign countries. It will also recommend some solutions for overcoming these challenges.",2024,Government & Law,1
Enhancing Access to Medicines: Interpreting Exceptions to Patent Rights in Article 30 TRIPS,; INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC-LAW; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; GLOBAL GOVERNANCE; DOHA DECLARATION; FREE-TRADE; WTO; WORLD; AGREEMENT; DISPUTES,"Ensuring access to essential medicines is a significant challenge for states. Concerns around strict patent protection becoming a barrier to access presents a potential tension between states' international obligations set out in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and states' human rights obligations in relation to health. Such concerns exist not only with regard to TRIPS, but also other bilateral and regional free trade agreements. This article examines how such tensions could be addressed through treaty interpretation, in particular the extent to which TRIPS could be interpreted to serve public health objectives. Specific focus is placed on the exceptions to patent protection in Article 30 of TRIPS to evaluate whether the WTO Dispute Settlement Body could apply a broader interpretation of Article 30, in light of the objectives and purpose of TRIPS outlined in Articles 7 and 8, for the purpose of enhancing access to cheaper generic medicines.",2022,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1
"Stocking pattern for anti-malarial medications among proprietary patent medicine vendors in Akinyele Local Government Area, Ibadan, Nigeria",Proprietary patent medicine vendors; Recommended anti-malarial; Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT); Stocking; Knowledge; Perception; DRUG STORES; MALARIA; KNOWLEDGE,"Background Policymakers have recognized that proprietary patent medicine vendors (PPMVs) can provide an opportunity for effective scaling up of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) since they constitute a major source of malaria treatment in Nigeria. This study was designed to determine the stocking pattern for anti-malarial medications, knowledge of the recommended anti-malarial medicine among PPMVs in Akinyele Local Government Area (LGA) of Oyo State, Nigeria and their perception on ways to improve PPMV adherence to stocking ACT medicines. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 320 PPMVs using a mixed method of data collection. Survey respondents were consecutively selected as a complete listing of all the PPMVs was not available. A pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data and two focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted among PPMVs using a pretested FGD guide. Results Most PPMVs stocked artemether-lumefantrine (90.9%), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (5.3%) and artesunate-amodiaquine (2.8%). Drugs contrary to the policy, which included sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, chloroquine, quinine, halofantrine, artesunate, and artemether were stocked by 93.8, 22.8, 0.6, 1.3, 6.6, and 7.8% of the PPMVs, respectively. Most PPMVs (96.3%) had good knowledge of artemether-lumefantrine as the first-line treatment for malaria and 2.8% had good knowledge of artesunate-amodiaquine as the alternate treatment for malaria. The major factors influencing stocking decision were government recommendations (41.3%) and consumer demand (40.30%). Conclusion Stocking of artemisinin-based combinations was high among PPMVs, although they also stocked and dispensed other anti-malarial drugs and this has serious implications for drug resistance development. The PPMVs had considerable knowledge of the recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria and stocking decisions were overwhelmingly driven by consumer demand. However, there is a need for more enlightenment on discontinuation of government-banned anti-malarial drugs.",2020,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,1
"Designing policy based on entrepreneurial venture type: the effects of innovation, hiring practices and patent ownership on enterprise development",Small business policies; Enterprise development; Innovative startups; Innovative SMEs; Italy; Stochastic frontier analysis; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FIRM SIZE; DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTIVITY; MODERATING ROLE; START-UPS; PERFORMANCE; SMES; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH,"Purpose - The Italian government enacted two laws: ruling innovative startups (Law 221/2012) and innovative SMEs (Law Decree 3/2015), respectively. Despite renowned differences between them, the parameters selected and included in these laws are the same: investments in research and development (R&D) activities, hiring specialized researchers and holding patents/property rights. Taking a cue from the Italian case, the following research question emerges: whether small business policies, concerning innovative startups and SMEs, should be differentiated to be effective and support enterprise development. The Italian case is invoked to offer suggestions and recommendations to policymakers around the world. Design/methodology/approach - Stochastic frontier analyses (SFA) were conducted by using data provided by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE) about 14,595 innovative startups and 2,338 innovative SMEs. Findings - Statistical results reveal that enterprise development processes are different between innovative startups and SMEs. Innovative startups may start a virtuous model, while innovative SMEs may not. This corroborates the idea that small business policies need to be differentiated in order to be effective. Originality/value - Unlike other papers, small businesses are not considered as a whole. Innovative startups and SMEs are two different types of firms, so specific investigations are conducted to remark on the already-known differences and disclose new ones.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Does corporate social responsibility influence corporate innovation?

We re-examine this issue using a newly available comprehensive innovation database on 20 countries and find support for the view that CSR performance fosters innovation. This effect of CSR is reflected on corporate innovation through its environmental and social dimensions. We also show that the effect of CSR on corporate innovation is less pronounced in emerging countries, but this is driven only by the environmental dimension of CSR. Finally, in comparison to common-law countries, we report a more positive impact of CSR on innovation in civil-law countries.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Authoring Prior Art,; COPYRIGHT; PATENT,"Patent law and copyright law are widely understood to diverge in how they approach prior art, the universe of information that already existed before a particular innovation's development. For patents, prior art is paramount. An invention can't be patented unless it is both novel and nonobvious when viewed against the backdrop of all the earlier inventions that paved the way. But for copyrights, prior art is supposed to be virtually irrelevant. Black-letter copyright doctrine doesn't care if a creative work happens to resemble its predecessors, only that it isn't actually copied from them. In principle, then, outside of the narrow question of whether someone might have drawn from a preexisting third-party source, copyright infringement disputes would seem to have little doctrinal use for prior art. But that principle turns out to be missing a big part of what's actually going on in copyright litigation today. In this Article, we identify a surprising trend: parties in cases involving music are increasingly discussing anticipatory earlier works, and judges are increasingly holding it against them if they don't. The concept of prior art, once for inventors only, is now for authors, too. A major cause for this change, we argue, is the influence of a small cadre of expert witnesses. We interviewed several of the most active experts in music copyright disputes, and we analyzed dozens of reports that they have filed over the last two decades. Our data revealed a group that has been focused on authorial prior art since well before the courts were. These experts' professional self-understanding, moreover, diverges sharply from the traditionally limited role that experts are supposed to play in evaluating copyright infringement. They view prior art research as a major part of their job. And for many of them, that research is important not just because it can sift between copying and independent creation, but also because it informs their normative view of what expression deserves legal exclusivity in the first place. Because of this expert community, prior art isn't just for patents anymore.",2022,Government & Law,1
Right-to-Work laws and corporate innovation,Right-to-work laws; Corporate innovations; Financial distress risk; FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS; CAPITAL STRUCTURE; LABOR; COMPETITION; RISK; DETERMINANTS; UNIONIZATION; BEHAVIOR; FIRMS; HETEROGENEITY,"We show that state right-to-work (RTW) laws significantly encourage corporate innovations in terms of patent grant and citation count. Consistent with the conjecture that the RTW-treated firms conduct more innovations due to their decreased financial distress risk, we find that the RTW adoption also significantly decreases treated firms' financial distress risk ex post, and its treatment effect on innovation outputs is stronger for treated firms that are ex ante more likely to experience financial distress. Further analysis indicates that treated firms intensify research and development expenditures and, likely due to their improved innovations, enhance their competitiveness in product markets.",2022,Business & Economics,1

Estimation results focusing on EU countries over the period 2011-2018 reveals that in some medium high-tech manufacturing industries (i.e., manufacturing of chemical products and motor-vehicles) and in the gas and electricity industries the innovative performance of SOEs is on average superior to those of POEs. No statistically significant difference can be detected in high-tech manufacturing, while in knowl-edge intensive services the evidence is mixed: SOEs innovation output is inferior to POEs' in professional, scientific, and technical activities; yet SOEs outperform POEs in transport services. Overall, these results suggest that, in specific economic sectors, SOEs may act as an important vehicle for technological development.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The TRIPS Waiver for COVID-19 Vaccine Patents: Lessons for the Transfer of Technologies,; AGREEMENT,"Addressing climate change requires the rapid transfer of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs). Although intellectual property rights (IPRs) are not, at present, a significant barrier to the transfer of ESTs, reform is required to ensure that international intellectual property law does not hinder the future transfer of ESTs. The World Trade Organization's Ministerial Decision of 17 June 2022 waives patent rights over COVID-19 vaccines. This article analyses whether this Decision provides lessons for the transfer of ESTs. This article recommends a Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver for EST IPRs. Alternatively, it recommends subsidies for the licensing of ESTs, and amendments to compulsory licensing and government use under TRIPS.",2023,Government & Law,1
Pandemic-Resilient Investment: Sustainable Knowledge Infrastructure for Medical AI,Medial AI; Patent-sharing mechanisms; Innovation; Two-pronged solution; Knowledge sharing; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; PATENT; INNOVATION; FAIRNESS; LAW,"While the meteoric rise of medical AI promises transformative solutions to global health challenges, ensuring equitable access to these life-saving technologies remains a formidable obstacle. Policymakers wrestle with a seemingly impossible feat: fostering the continued innovation pipeline while bridging the stark divide in accessibility. Existing patent-sharing mechanisms, from compulsory licensing to voluntary pledges, have proven demonstrably insufficient, failing to strike the delicate balance between incentivizing innovation and guaranteeing widespread availability. This paper proposes a bold departure from these one-size-fits-all solutions. Drawing upon the principles of distributive justice, I present a two-pronged solution that tackles the issue from both ends of the spectrum. On the macro level, it calls for international collaboration and reciprocity among states, urging them to fulfill their shared responsibility in making patented medical technologies universally and affordably accessible. On the micro level, it compels patent holders to embrace ethical responsibility, challenging them to confront the inherent inequities of intellectual property protection. This novel framework represents a paradigm shift, holding immense potential to unlock a future where medical advancements reach every corner of the globe. Unlike its predecessors, it recognizes the intricate dance between innovation and access, offering a practical roadmap for policymakers and patent holders. By embracing cooperation and ethical responsibility, we can pave the way for a healthier world where the promise of medical AI translates into tangible improvements for people everywhere, not just a privileged few. This is not simply an academic pursuit but a call to action, a challenge to rewrite the narrative of medical technology distribution and forge a future where health equity reigns supreme.",2024,Business & Economics,1
The emergent property market,Sci-fi; Liquified law; Robot law; Artificial intelligence; Intellectual property; ,"The title of this piece is a somewhat heavy-handed word play. The property market I'm writing about is the market in intellectual property, which is broken in so many ways, evidenced by the existence of patent mountains and patent trolls, fighting over how many angles they can fit in the 360 degrees around the head of a pin, rather than actually innovating. (It is well known in creative tech circles that pausing to talk to the IP lawyers would never have led to the discovery of the internet protocol). The emergent property I'm referring to is the possibility that such a complex system could fairly suddenly exhibit some new behaviour. In this article, I speculate that this new behaviour could just be that the idea of property ceases to exist. The article is written somewhat derivatively after the 1960s science fiction style of writers such as Cyril Kornbluth, JG Ballard, and John Brunner. Any resemblance to their very creative output is entirely good luck rather than actual skill.",2020,Communication; Government & Law,1
Market Exclusivity and the Right to Health in South Africa: A Primer for Tackling the Paradox,Exclusivity; IP; right to health; affordable Medicare; South Africa; ,"South Africa remains confronted with challenges to the realization of the right to healthcare services, shaped by both national and global dynamics. The proliferation of exclusivity regimes in intellectual property (IP) rule-making poses a threat to affordable healthcare services. Although South Africa is not a signatory to any of these enhanced IP norms, it may still be at risk through transposition, given that the current norm-setting constitutes the future direction of rule-making. These global dynamics are compounded by overly protective measures in South Africa's patent law as well as non-IP factors, particularly the prevalent weak health infrastructure. Although South Africa's IP Policy Phase I incorporates a raft of changes to address the situation, capacity constraints could thwart effective outcomes. Consequently, beyond the current patent law reform, there should be a roadmap for how to manage global IP norm-setting as well as non-IP factors, to foster universal healthcare coverage in South Africa.",2020,Government & Law,1
Do the Main Developers of Electrical and Electronic Equipment Comply with the Precepts of the Circular Economy Concepts? A Patent-Based Approach,electronic equipment; circular economy; patents; environment; sustainability; WASTE; TECHNOLOGIES; STRATEGIES; METALS,"The unceasing demand for electronic equipment has led to numerous problems, such as environmental damage and raw material shortages. The adoption of circular production chains and the precepts of the circular economy when designing electronic equipment could minimize these problems by fostering the reuse of resources without loss of quality or value. The scientific literature has many studies on the importance of circular production, but there are no data to demonstrate whether the scientific information produced on the circular economy and circular production is being taken up by industry. This study analyzes whether patent applications for inventions applicable to the production of electronic equipment meet the precepts of the circular economy. To this end, a study of patent documents was conducted. A total of 3638 documents were retrieved. Their analysis revealed that the technologies developed by the leading patent applicants and manufacturers are mainly from the first link in the production chain, materials, and components. The solutions proposed tend to be geared toward equipment efficiency and reduced energy consumption, which may indirectly increase the equipment's useful life and save energy. Despite the existence of laws and research highlighting the importance of feeding used materials back into the production process, the developers of electronic equipment have not yet turned their attention to the recycling and retrieval of materials for their use as inputs for new components.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
An Evolutionary Analysis of Higher-Order Interaction Collaborative Innovation Networks in China's New Energy Vehicle Industry,new energy vehicle; higher-order interaction network; generalized degree; simplicial complex; TECHNOLOGY; PATENTS; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT,"As a manifestation of technological innovation achievements, patents reflect the frontier of technological development in the field. The aim of this research is to investigate the spatial evolution of patent collaboration networks and cooperation activities in the Chinese new energy vehicle (NEV) industry. We hypothesize that the higher-order collaboration networks will exhibit the formation of triangle groups centered around core nodes and the emergence of key edges indicating their importance. Key organizations and partners will play a significant role in shaping the future direction of cooperative innovation. The research utilizes data on collaboration patents in the NEV industry in China and constructs higher-order interaction collaboration innovation networks. The spatial evolution of networks and patent cooperation activities are examined using simplex methods. The results indicate that the generalized degree distribution of nodes and edges follows a power-law distribution. Two-dimensional simplex networks gradually form triangle clusters centered on core nodes and key edges. Large companies and research institutes prefer high-depth collaboration, while universities prefer high-breadth collaboration. Furthermore, the development of the new energy vehicle industry has gradually shifted from the eastern region to the central region. In the two-dimensional simplex network, Beijing and Jiangsu play a crucial role as key bridges in fostering stable and deep collaborations. The findings of this study shed light on the spatial evolution of patent collaboration networks and cooperation activities in the Chinese NEV industry. The identification of key organizations and partners, as well as the central positions of certain regions, provides valuable insights for innovation organizations in navigating innovation development and selecting collaboration partners.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
The remarkable development and significance of constitutional protection for intellectual property rights in post-Arab Spring constitutions,intellectual property; constitutions; constitutional protection; human rights; patents; access to medicines; Islamic law; Egypt; Tunisia; Arab Spring; globalization; postcolonialism; PATENTS; ACCESS; EGYPT; LAW,"Prior to the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, no constitutional protection for intellectual property (IP) existed in the many earlier constitutions of Egypt or Tunisia. It is remarkable and surprising therefore that, in 2014, IP clauses appeared in the post-revolutionary constitutions of both countries. This raises the key question: why add to the existing regulation of IP in this way. Is constitutional protection just another example of the inexorable strengthening of IP rights (IPRs) or could it be a means of constraining them, where necessary, to protect other rights? This article argues that including IP in a constitution may, rather than merely strengthening IP owners' rights, open IPRs up to competition against more fundamental constitutionally protected human rights and, for example, support the prioritization of the right to health. This could be a valid explanation for and potential use of the inclusion of IP in the Egyptian and Tunisian Constitutions.",2020,Government & Law,1

We first establish that valuable innovation output makes firms particularly vulnerable to costly low-quality class action litigation. Exploiting judge turnover in federal courts, we then show that changes in class action litigation risk affect the value and number of patents filed, suggesting firms take into account that risk in their innovation decisions. A new perspective we provide is that innovation success, not only innovation failure, can increase firms' securities class action litigation risk.",2023,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,1
Insurance Coverage and Induced Infringement: A Threat to Hatch-Waxman's Skinny Labeling Pathway?,; SUBSTITUTION LAWS,"In the fall of 2020, Amarin Corporation-a brand-name drug company- brought an unprecedented claim in federal court. Instead of just suing a generic manufacturer for inducing infringement of its method patent, as is typical in litiga-tion over skinny label generic drugs, Amarin also added a health insurance com-pany as a defendant. In its complaint, Amarin alleged that Health Net induced infringement under 35 U.S.C. 271(b) of the Patent Act by charging a lower co-pay for the generic, skinny label version of its brand-name drug. Industry commentators agreed that a finding of liability for Health Net would be a blow to the generic in-dustry, as the precedent would dissuade insurers from covering skinny label gener-ics in the future. Amarin's case withstood a motion to dismiss before the parties settled. Using Amarin Pharma, Inc. v. Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. as a jump-ing off point, this Comment is the first piece of legal scholarship to examine whether, and under what circumstances, health insurers can induce infringement of a method patent by providing preferential coverage of a skinny label generic when it is distributed for a patented drug indication. An evaluation of this question requires examining the standard of causation in induced infringement cases, a subject that has received startlingly little judicial or scholarly inquiry. This Comment argues that the Delaware district court's decision in Amarin was based on an improper theory of causation that assumed insurance companies have a duty to prevent in-fringement. It then establishes that the proper counterfactual baseline for evaluating inducement claims against insurers reveals that insurance companies are rarely the but-for cause of infringement in the skinny label context. In proposing an application of the loss of chance doctrine to determine liability in future cases, this Comment also identifies and addresses a key legal error from the majority opinion in GlaxoSmithKline LLC v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.: a misapplication of cau-sation principles in damages calculations for induced infringement. Ultimately, the Comment demonstrates that adopting a loss of chance theory of the injury in future cases would force courts to conduct often-ignored causation analysis and ensure that a finding of inducement corresponds with a proportionate damages award.",2023,Government & Law,1

As part of the IRS's duties, they often consider taxpayers' financial statements to help ensure accurate tax reporting and payments. We posit that enhanced financial statement disclosures of tax information under FASB Interpretation Number 48 (FIN 48) lead to more IRS scrutiny and alter the incentives for corporate innovation. Using patent applications as a measure of corporate innovation, we employ a difference-in-differences research design with publicly listed US firms as the treatment group and privately held US firms not subject to the disclosure requirements as the control group. We find robust evidence that, following the onset of FIN 48, the number of patent applications by publicly listed firms decreased between 15.4% and 24.3% relative to private firms. This decline in patent applications is attributable to incremental innovation, suggesting that firms lower innovation related to projects with tax benefits that are more likely to be scrutinized by the taxing authorities. These findings suggest that there are real effects of IRS scrutiny and, in particular, real effects of tax disclosures under FIN 48 on corporate innovation.",2024,Business & Economics,1

Although existing highly effective oral medications might be formulated as long-acting parenteral treatments, pharmacological, regulatory, patent, and medical challenges have to be overcome; this requires the concerted efforts of PLWHC, researchers, funding agencies, industry, the World Health Organization, and other stakeholders. A long-acting hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment that allows a single-encounter cure could have enormous individual and public health effects.

Academic stars and licensing experience in university technology commercialization,academic stars; administrative data; licensing experience; patents; university technology commercialization; BAYH-DOLE ACT; SCIENCE; INVENTION; PATENT; DETERMINANTS; INCENTIVES; SCIENTISTS; INNOVATION,"Research Summary We examine the process by which university technology transfer offices (TTOs) allocate internal resources, which provides insight into technologies offered for commercialization to the private sector. Using detailed administrative records of patenting decisions and outcomes by one prominent U.S. research-based university's TTO over a 30-year period, we analyze the performance of invention disclosures by academic stars and by inventors with prior licensing experience. We find that the lead inventor's academic prominence (but not licensing experience) predicts patent application filing, while licensing experience (but not academic prominence) predicts patent impact and commercialization success. We supplement this descriptive analysis with follow-up interviews and empirical evaluation of possible mechanisms for this seemingly outsized role of academic stars. Managerial Summary Increasingly prevalent hybrid organizations are expected to fulfill multiple objectives. University technology transfer offices (TTOs) are an example of a hybrid organization and are charged with disseminating academia-originated technology for the public good as well as for economic benefit. We study how one TTO allocates internal resources, using comprehensive in-house administrative data over a 30-year span. We find that while the TTO tends to put resources behind inventions by academic stars, the commercial returns from licensing inventions from such individuals are no different than inventions by non-stars. By contrast, inventors' prior licensing experience highly predicts commercial returns. These results illustrate the challenges inherent in internal resource allocation inside a complex hybrid organization.",2023,Business & Economics,1
"The Challenge of Sanctioning Unfair Royalty Rate by the SEP Holder: 'When', 'How' and 'What'","Standard Essential Patent; royalty rate; Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory terms; unfair pricing; Article 102(a) TFEU; EU Court of Justice; United Brands test; benchmarking methods; efficiency defence; competition law remedies; COMPETITION; JUSTIFICATIONS","The holder of a Standard Essential Patent (SEP) is usually required to license its patent to any licensee on the basis of Fair and Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms. In their recent judgments in Unwired Planet and Sisvel v. Haier, the UK Supreme Court and the German Bundesgerichtshof ruled that a 'range', rather than a 'single' royalty rate, may be considered compatible with the FRAND commitment. On the other hand, a royalty rate 'beyond the outer boundary of the range' would not be FRAND. In addition, an 'unfair' royalty rate might also be regarded as an abuse of dominant position by the SEP holder, in breach of Article 102(a) Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The paper analyses whether and under what circumstances Article 102(a) TFEU could be relied on by a competition authority in Europe to sanction a case of 'unfair' royalty rate requested by the SEP holder to its licensees. In particular, the paper assesses 'when' competition policy should sanction an unfair royalty rate requested by the SEP holder, 'how' a competition agency should analyse the case in accordance with the case law of the EU Court of Justice concerning Article 102(a) TFEU and, eventually, 'what' remedies the competition authority could adopt.",2021,Government & Law,1

I explore how pioneering Victorian women at the turn of the last century inventively responded via clothing to restrictions to their (physical and ideological) freedom of movement. While the bicycle is typically celebrated as a primary vehicle of women's emancipation at that time, I argue that inventive forms of clothing, such as convertible cycling skirts, also helped women make claims to rights and privileges otherwise legally denied to their sex. I ask: Do clothing inventions create possibilities to act differently? Can they be thought of as wearable technology, and in what ways do they (and their invention) enact political concerns? Might convertible cycling skirts be considered acts of citizenship? Throughout, I mobilize concepts of multiplicity, in-betweenness, and ambiguity to make a case for the relevance of clothing research for science and technology studies.",2023,Social Issues,1
Detecting and Visualizing the Communities of Innovation in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration Based on the Patent Cooperation Network,; EMERGING RESEARCH FRONTS,"For a deep understanding of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) collaborative innovation, we detected and visualized the communities of innovation in BTH Urban Agglomeration based on the patent cooperation network. China Patent Database was connected with Business Registration Database and the Tianyan Check to achieve the geographical information of organizational innovators. Spinglass algorithm was applied and ultimately 12 communities of innovation were detected. Based on the different structure characteristics, we further clustered the 12 communities into four typical structures that are hierarchical, single-center, polycentric, and flat structures. The hierarchical structure is usually large in scale and the cooperative intensity is relatively high. Single-center structure has a center with a high proportion of centrality and the cooperative intensity is relatively low. Polycentric structure has multiple centers with similar proportions of centrality. Flat structure is usually small in scale and has no obvious network center. In the patent cooperative network of BTH Urban Agglomeration, universities and state-owned enterprises occupied the centers and acted important roles to connect other organizations. Some communities of innovation showed significant industry characteristics, mainly involving six industry fields that are electric power, construction, petroleum, metallurgy and materials, municipal transportation, and railway. From the geographical perspective, some communities manifested local attributes and some demonstrated cooperation between regions. Beijing was the center of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei patent cooperation network. Compared with the pair of Beijing-Tianjin and the pair of Beijing-Hebei, Tianjin and Hebei were not closely connected. In the future, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei collaborative innovation should strengthen cooperation between Tianjin and Hebei.",2021,Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Utilisation Trend of Long-Acting Insulin Analogues including Biosimilars across Europe: Findings and Implications,; NATIONAL-HEALTH-SERVICE; PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS; GLARGINE 100 U/ML; PRESCRIBING EFFICIENCY; UTILIZATION PATTERNS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; GLYCEMIC CONTROL; CROHNS-DISEASE; NPH INSULIN; LOW PRICES,"Background. Diabetes mellitus rates and associated costs continue to rise across Europe enhancing health authority focus on its management. The risk of complications is enhanced by poor glycaemic control, with long-acting insulin analogues developed to reduce hypoglycaemia and improve patient convenience. There are concerns though with their considerably higher costs, but moderated by reductions in complications and associated costs. Biosimilars can help further reduce costs. However, to date, price reductions for biosimilar insulin glargine appear limited. In addition, the originator company has switched promotional efforts to more concentrated patented formulations to reduce the impact of biosimilars. There are also concerns with different devices between the manufacturers. As a result, there is a need to assess current utilisation rates for insulins, especially long-acting insulin analogues and biosimilars, and the rationale for patterns seen, among multiple European countries to provide future direction. Methodology. Health authority databases are examined to assess utilisation and expenditure patterns for insulins, including biosimilar insulin glargine. Explanations for patterns seen were provided by senior-level personnel. Results. Typically increasing use of long-acting insulin analogues across Europe including both Western and Central and Eastern European countries reflects perceived patient benefits despite higher prices. However, activities by the originator company to switch patients to more concentrated insulin glargine coupled with lowering prices towards biosimilars have limited biosimilar uptake, with biosimilars not currently launched in a minority of European countries. A number of activities were identified to address this. Enhancing the attractiveness of the biosimilar insulin market is essential to encourage other biosimilar manufacturers to enter the market as more long-acting insulin analogues lose their patents to benefit all key stakeholder groups. Conclusions. There are concerns with the availability and use of insulin glargine biosimilars among European countries despite lower costs. This can be addressed.",2021,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Research & Experimental Medicine,1

However, the protection provided by IP laws may be inadequate for Naga communities. The paper attempts to analyse the limitations of IP laws of patents, copyrights, trademarks and GeographicalIndications (GI) for the protection of expression of Naga folklore. The finding shows that current IP laws in India do not fully protect the Naga folklore. This paper suggests that expressions of folklore need to look at alternative regimes. The paper further discusses the need for a sui generis legislation of an IP nature by presenting the example of sui generis legislation. As an overall outcome, it is concluded that a sui generis legislation of an IP nature would be able to protect the expression of Naga folklore.",2021,Government & Law,1
Embedding Human Dignity Standards into Biotechnology Patents: The Role of Morality Clauses,; BRUSTLE-V-GREENPEACE; STEM-CELL RESEARCH; HUMAN-RIGHTS; LAW; PATENTABILITY,"This paper proposes an approach to the debate on how to reconcile international trade and human rights, explaining the minimum content of the ordre public and morality clauses (OPMCs) as the recognition of international human rights law (IHRL) standards in trade law and intellectual property law. Within the context of a multicultural and globalised society, in which trade and economic interests are protected worldwide and morality seems to be a culture-based concept, the primary considerations of IHRL embedded in these pivot clauses serve as a universal defence for human beings and a safeguard to the coherence of the human-centred international system. In particular, this study argues that the OPMCs allow for the enforcement of three standards derived from human dignity in the wider spectrum of biotechnology and scientific research, even constituting legitimate limits to the economic exploitation of biotechnological inventions.",2021,Government & Law,1
The China paradox: the endogenous relationship between law and economic growth,Law; credibility thesis; endogenous economic growth; China; institutions; FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INSTITUTIONS; CREDIBILITY; OWNERSHIP; DETERMINANTS; GOVERNANCE; REFORM,"An enduring paradox of China's remarkable economic growth is the lack of a well-established legal system. By drawing on the credibility thesis, this paper proposes that legal and economic reforms give rise to, and reinforce, the other and the market is underpinned by evolving institutions that are shaped by the expectations of the actors in the economy. It is thus not the form of institutions but their function that is more important in assessing institutional performance. A comparative examination of the USA at a similar stage of legal-institutional development to China provides support for an evolutionary, endogenous process. This institutional analysis will focus on key issues of economic legislation, such as corporate law, patent law and securities. Analyzing the relationship as complementary processes can help explain the paradox of strong economic growth within an under-developed system of law with potential, critical implications for institutional development in other countries.",2021,Government & Law; Public Administration,1
Unauthorized and Unwise: The Lawful Use Requirement in Trademark Law,; COMMON-LAW; PROPERTY; ENFORCEMENT; POSSESSION; RULES,"For decades, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has required trademark owners to comply with sundry nontrademark laws governing the sale of their trademarked goods and services. Pursuant to this lawful use requirement, the Agency has refused or even cancelled registration of thousands of marks used on everything from Schedule I controlled substances to mislabeled soap. This Article subjects the Agency's lawful use requirement to long-overdue scrutiny. It suggests that in requiring compliance with other laws for registration, the PTO has lost sight of the one statute it is supposed to administer. In the process, the Agency has overstepped the limits of its statutory authority and undermined federal trademark policy. Whether a mark owner has used its mark to sell improperly labeled soap or an illicit drug, the PTO has no mandate, and no convincing policy reason, to deny the owner the substantial benefits of registration. Simply put, the Agency's lawful use requirement has no place in trademark law.",2022,Government & Law,1
"Ownership, liability, patentability, and creativity issues in artificial intelligence",Artificial intelligence; law; ownership; patentability; liability; copyright; creativity; ,"While Artificial Intelligence technologies find increasing use in different industries such as transportation, healthcare and other services, it gives rise to legal complexities in respect of ownership and liability of AI, patentability of AI inventions, and creativity & ownership of AI-generated works attributable to various components of AI. The autonomous decision-making ability of AI challenges the existing IP framework. Since AI machines can think and act without any human effort, if any damage or harm occurs to the properties, does the current model of tort liability (product liability, negligence, strict liability) adequately address the legal concerns? Robust regulatory bodies and institutional mechanisms are required to develop rigorous safety standards and establish safety certification processes for AI. Even though AI inventions can be patented, many jurisdictions recognize only a human as an inventor and not the AI. With the increasing capability of AI to generate works without human intervention, there seems to be a strong case for granting copyright protection to AI-generated works. Exploring a separate legal framework for AI to reduce ambiguity and increase accountability would be in order.",2022,Computer Science,1
Enforcement of Fines and Other Pecuniary Obligations Imposed by the ECB (Part I): European Level,; ,"This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the enforcement of fines and pecuniary obligations imposed by the ECB within the Eurosystem and the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) under Art. 299 TFEU - an issue which has, to date, been treated only rudimentarily in literature/judicature. The focus in Part I lies on five categories of monetary obligations that the ECB may levy. Against the background of these case groups, the European law requirements that exist for enforcement will be shown. Part II will show how these requirements are fulfilled in euro and non-euro Member States (MSs). The latter will be based on a comparative analysis of the respective data collected in 2020 via a questionnaire survey in 21 MSs. The relevance of the findings are, however, not limited to the ECB. Legal acts of the Council and the EC1, as well as judgments of the CJEU (Art. 280 TFEU), are enforced under the same regime; Art. 82 of the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court (UPCA)2 is modelled on Art. 299 TFEU.",2022,Government & Law,1
Looking at Monarchy Askance: Royal Brand Names and Trademark Law in the German Empire,German Empire; monarchy; consumerism; royal brand names; legal history; trademark law; co-branding; Manoli; Wilhelm II; ,"This article uses the example of Manoli Cigarettes and its product line, The Kaiser Cigarettes, to examine the concept of co-branding as applied to royal brand names in the German Empire. It reviews the broader networks of circulation that determined the production of royal brand names: commercial laws, business ties, advances in technology, advertising structures, tourism, and other sectors of the consumer economy. The article delves into how trademark law, the Imperial Patent Office's role in approving brand names, and case law contributed to the choice of royal brand names. The article also illuminates how manufacturers used royal brands to implement business strategies along a horizontal plane of market competition. The production of the monarchy as a cultural object was thus activated through a process of triangulation: not only through the bilateral relationship between monarch and subjects, but also lateral relations between producers who were concerned about their professional networks.",2023,History,1
"Artificial intelligence, inventorship and the myth of the inventing machine: Can a process be an inventor?",Patents; inventor; inventorship; artificial intelligence; software; Patents Act 1977; ,"Institutional and academic debates have intensified regarding the recent efforts to claim inventorship of AI-related patent applications, as has notably been seen in the known cases of Thaler v Comptroller ('DABUS') that have been examined in various jurisdictions. The pertinent question that has emerged is whether artificial intelligence systems can independently produce patentable subject matter. What has to be looked at, first, is the preliminary question of what the claim of producing inventions 'autonomously' can possibly mean under a technological perspective - an essential stage in the debate that is usually bypassed in legal commentary. Once such a technological explanation has been provided, a legal question can reasonably arise as to whether an AI process, such as software, may make a contribution that rewards a patent. AI inventions are legally approached and analysed as processes and as to their relationship with their direct products. Thus, where a process (AI) 'creates' or 'makes' a product, the focus is reasonably put on if and to what extent disclosing the product can provide a contribution separate to that which has already been provided by the process that created it. It is stressed that the current push for AI-generated products bypasses this key question which is essential in assessing the invention.",2023,Government & Law,1
Ligands for cereblon: 2017-2021 patent overview,Cereblon; immunomodulatory drugs; glutarimide; protacs; non-thalidomide-like compounds; IDENTIFICATION,"Introduction Cereblon (CRBN), the substrate receptor of the CRL4(CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase has been extensively studied due to its involvement in many biological processes. It has also been identified as the target for immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). CRBN ligands are also important components of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), special bifunctional constructs capable of targeted degradation of aberrantly acting proteins using the cell's ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. Areas covered Due to upsurge of the PROTAC technology, the patenting activity of new CRBN ligands has been on the rise in the last 5 years. The present review covers two broadly defined areas of CRBN ligand design. One covers 'thalidomide-like' molecules representing modifications of various parts of classical IMiDs. The other areas - non-thalidomide-like compounds - are compounds that are structurally distinct from the classical IMiDs. Efforts toward creating new CRBN ligands reflected in non-patent literature are briefly discussed with emphasis on the rational, crystallography-driven approaches. Expert opinion The chemical space of CRBN ligands which is related to the classical IMiDs (thalidomide/lenalidomide/pomalidomide) is comprehensively covered by the current patent literature. The promising area of research is in the identification of non-thalidomide-like chemotypes capable of binding to CRBN. Rational, crystallography-driven approaches currently exploited in academia will significantly aid in this endeavor.",2022,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Impacts of Environmental Agreements on Bilateral Trade of Climate Industry,climate change; technology; environmental agreements; gravity model; Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood; CURRENCY UNIONS; KYOTO; REGULATIONS; GRAVITY,"We investigated the effect of agreements related to climate change on bilateral trade, using the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) estimator on a large dataset that requires computing high-dimensional fixed effects. This study develops the concordance between commodities based on harmonized systems (HS) and technologies defined by both international and cooperative patent classifications (IPC/CPC). Using the OECD ENV-TECH classification, covering 169 exporting countries and 179 importing countries worldwide from 1991 to 2019, we determined the relationship between HS commodities and IPC/CPC climate change technologies. The main findings show that, first, the Kyoto Protocol has increased international bilateral trade in the climate change industry, while the Montreal Protocol has led to the opposite effect. In addition, the impact of environmental stringency on international bilateral trade in climate-related industries was negative and significant, refuting the Porter Hypothesis. This result was consistent within the trade between the convention countries. Therefore, national and industrial perspectives are relative, and voluntary climate mitigation methods should be applied, considering the areas where carbon reduction is relatively difficult. In other words, the conventions and policies must shift to a global paradigm in environmental protection and a more inclusive approach, with recognition of diversity in governance types.",2021,Energy & Fuels,1
Can IP tribunals increase firm patent applications?-Empirical evidence from China,Property rights protection; Intellectual property tribunal; Firm innovation; Institutional change; China economy; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; PROTECTION; LAWS; INVESTMENT; OWNERSHIP,"This paper aims to examine whether property rights protection can enhance firm innovation. To address the endogeneity problem and establish a causal relationship, we adopt the establishment of Intellectual Property Tribunals (IP Tribunals) in China as a natural experiment and employ the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach for estimation. By measuring firm innovation via patents and invention patent applications, we find that establishing IP Tribunals can significantly boost firm innovation. Furthermore, we investigate the heterogeneity of our baseline results and discover that privately-owned firms, smaller-sized firms, non-high-tech firms, and firms located in less marketized areas experience a larger improvement in innovation. This finding suggests that this institutional improvement provides greater protection to disadvantaged firms. Breaking regional protectionism and relaxing firm financing constraints are two possible mechanisms through which IP Tribunals can enhance firm innovation. Our results provide new evidence on how institutional change affects economic growth in China.",2024,Business & Economics,1
License to All or Access to All? A Law and Economics Assessment of Standard Development Organizations' Licensing Rules,; ,"In the continuing debate over licensing standard essential patents (SEPs) on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions, one of the most heated topics is whether FRAND commitments should be interpreted to require licensing all comers or whether access to standards can be achieved through other, less rigid means. This Article evaluates both the legal and the economic arguments underlying this debate. This Article concludes that neither the law nor economic welfare justifies a license to all interpretation of FRAND commitments and that imposition of such an interpretation would likely be harmful to social welfare.",2020,Government & Law,1
"Verinata Health, Inc. v. Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc.",; ,"In the proceedings below, a jury found Illumina's patents claiming custom DNA assay optimization techniques'' and methods for noninvasive prenatal screening of fetal chromosomal abnormalities were infringed by Ariosa's Harmony Prenatal Test, a multiplex method that analyzes fetal cell-free DNA (or cfDNA). The district court denied Ariosa's motion for judgment as a matter of law on invalidity and noninfringement (upholding the jury's verdict), and also denied Illumina's motion for permanent injunction. On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed. Ariosa argued that its method is not infringing because, inter alia, it does not include the use of an amplicon'' as recited in the claims. Instead, the Illumina method employs a readout cassette,'' which is only a portion of an amplified DNA segment and thus not a complete amplicon.'' The court found that the jury could have reasonably found that Illumina's readout cassette'' is equivalent to the recited amplicon'' based on expert testimony. The court further found that the jury's determination that the patent claims satisfy the enablement requirement was supported by substantial evidence, including the fact that an algorithm for determining the presence or absence of a fetal aneuploidy in the context of the claimed method, which was incorporated by reference into the patent, was the same statistical method used by scientists working for Ariosa's parent company (Roche) to screen for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. The court also held that the district court had not abused its discretion in denying Illumina's request for a permanent injunction, based on case law finding that under the Supreme Court's eBay test for whether a court should enter a permanent injunction, it is appropriate for a court to deny a permanent injunction when the patentee and infringer are not in direct competition. Illumina and Ariosa were found to not be direct competitors, because Illumina licenses its patents and products, allowing third-party laboratories to conduct their own tests, while Ariosa does not utilize a licensing model, instead selling its Harmony test directly.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1

Developing an institutional theory of country image, the authors argue that weak legal institutions at the country level increase firm opportunistic behavior that expropriates consumers and decrease the product quality of local brands, thus decreasing the country's image regarding its products and brands. Design/methodology/approach This study measures country image for products and brands using the number of valuable brands (i.e. brands included in the top 500 brands from 2008 to 2016) in a particular home country. Data concerning the rule of law in each country come from the World Bank, and data on the efficiency of countries' judicial systems comes from Djankovet al.(2007). We also collect patent data from the US Patent and Trade Office, national culture from Hofstede Insights and GDP and GDP per capita from the World Bank as control variables. Panel Poisson regression, Tobit regression and truncated regression are used in the analyses. Findings Supporting the institutional theory of country image, both the rule of law and efficiency of the judicial systems show positive and significant effects on country image, even when economy size (GDP), degree of economic development (GDP per capita), level of technology and skill (patents) and culture are controlled. Practical implications To improve their country's image and the brand value of local firms, policymakers should strive to strengthen legal institutions aimed at punishing firm opportunistic behavior in their countries. Originality/value Previous research on the country-of-origin effect has not yet appreciated the role of legal institutions in developing the construct of country image.",2020,Business & Economics,1

Design/methodology/approach By analyzing the technological development capability of individual companies, the direction of the companies' R&D activities and current state of technological fusion between them can be understood. A group of companies participating in a particular product/service market must have the same technological development capabilities. As a result, the ratio of patent applications by a company to the total number of applications in a technical field will be similar across companies. This study uses the inter-company correlation coefficient of the ratio of patent applications by technical field as an index of technological development capability. A total of 167 major companies covering the major industries of Japan were analyzed. The analysis period was 15 years from 2004 to 2018, and the technical fields were rearranged to 42 fields with reference to the International Patent Classification (IPC)-Technology Concordance used by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Considering the fluctuation in patent application opportunities, the number of patent applications was collected for at least three years for the analysis of patent applications by technical field, company and industry. Findings Examining the entire Japanese industry, the research found that chemicals, ceramics, non-ferrous metals and electrical/electronic equipment act as intermediaries between the respective groups and are linked to the transportation equipment, electrical/electronic equipment and information and communication services industries that are currently driving the Japanese economy. However, the technical connections between these groups are relatively loose. Over the last 15 years, the propagation structure of technical knowledge information has not changed. The progress of technological fusion remains within the scope of commerce and is conditioned by commerce. Originality/value Studies focusing on the technological development capability between companies and the technological structure of the Japanese manufacturing and service industries are almost non-existent since 2000 when Japan's economic growth slowed. The analytical methods presented in this research can be applied to individual companies to gain an understanding of technical positions of companies and can be useful for planning a technical environment, business or R&D strategy.",2024,Information Science & Library Science,1
KNOWLEDGE AS A PUBLIC GOOD AND KNOWLEDGE AS A COMMODITY,proprietary knowledge; common knowledge; patenting; knowledge monopolies; social inequality; ,"In order to shed some light on the issue of public knowledge, particularly scientific and technological knowledge, I will first examine the thesis that incremental in the sense of 'new' knowledge is rarely found in the public domain. Additional knowledge mainly produced in the scientific community and by research outside of science tends to be treated as a commodity. The restriction on a wide distribution of new knowledge may be based on a number of factors. I will concentrate on contemporary legal restrictions, especially, modern patenting laws. The second part of my observations deals with some of the complexities linked to the thesis that knowledge is a public good. I conclude with remarks about the link between the ownership of knowledge and social inequality.",2020,Philosophy,1
Impact of Patents on the Practice of Synthetic Biology in Australia: A Qualitative Study,; EMERGING SCIENCE; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PARTS; STANDARDIZATION; PRINCIPLE; CRISPR; LAW,"Synthetic biology is a developing field at the convergence of molecular biotechnology, biochemical engineering, genomics, and digital information technology. The field aims to transform how we tackle pressing global problems, including climate change and infectious diseases. It offers Australia an economic opportunity of $27 billion annually by 2040. As we invest in the scientific research, it is also important to explore intellectual property (IP) issues in this field. Based on interviews with synthetic biologists in Australia, this article examines how the potential IP impediments to innovation in synthetic biology anticipated in the literature play out in practice. While these conversations reveal some concerns and challenges with broad patents on foundational technologies, patent thickets, and issues with standardisation, many of the hypothetical problems identified in the legal literature are not playing out as expected. Scientists work around IP issues and those in university settings take comfort in the cover of academic use. While this immediately appears promising it also has important implications for innovation and the development of synthetic biology as a field which we explore.",2023,Government & Law,1
Can you patent the sun? Towards a sui generis inclusive right to manage the relationship between intellectual property and Commons,; HEALTH; THICKETS,"center dot This paper, by adopting the Covid-19 vaccine as a case study, argues that some pharmaceutical drugs should be considered as Commons, ie goods that are managed and owned by the public at large, and not as private property-exclusivity-of pharmaceutical companies. The reasons of such a strong argument are, on the one side, the conspicuous public-funding contribution to develop Covid-19 vaccines and other essential life-saving treatments, and, on the other side, the search for a human and equity-oriented Global Health Security. center dot It is true that, from a legal perspective, vaccines can be patented, leading to questionable practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as patent thickets. However, an alternative and fairer path, which would result in the theorization of a Commons for the vaccine, can be pursued. In particular, the actual types of Commons in the IP law field-the public domain, exceptions/limitations to patents and open innovation instruments such as IP pledges-present some issues in relation to enforceability. By forwarding the concept of 'negative spaces' to the patent realm, these spaces should not only claim to not enforce IP but also be able to 'enforce that non-enforcement'. center dot Therefore, this paper, by building on the work of the author Dusollier, advances the idea that from the inclusivity, which is the typical feature of every Commons, a sui generis inclusive right can be envisaged and applied in the context of the vaccine, by rethinking the relationship between IP and Commons.",2024,Government & Law,1

Applying the theological method of See-Judge-andAct, this article argues that the suspension of patents for COVID vaccines is morally justifiable in the light of CST's principles on the universal destination of earth's goods, the common good, and preferential option for the poor. The top pharmaceutical companies cannot claim absolute ownership to their vaccines as they do not totally own and fund the entire development and production process. Furthermore, the right to private ownership and patents has a social dimension and must serve the common good and welfare of the poor, especially in times of global emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Patent holders have a moral obligation to promote the common good and save the lives of the poor which must prevail over their capitalist quest for profit. This article recommends that Catholics and Christians must join this crusade for the suspension of patents as part of their spirituality of social transformation. Summary: Applying the Roman Catholic Church's set of moral principles on social concerns called CST and utilizing some secondary data and scientific research literature, this article examines the morality of India and South Africa's request to the World Trade Organization to temporarily suspend the property rights and patents of top pharmaceutical companies to their vaccines to allow low-income countries to locally manufacture them to save the lives of the poor during the current pandemic. Applying the theological method of See-Judge-and-Act, this article argues that the suspension of patents for COVID vaccines is morally justifiable in the light of CST's principles on the universal destination of earth goods, the common good, and preferential option for the poor. It recommends that Catholics and Christians must join this crusade for the suspension of patents as part of their spirituality of social transformation.

The study applied data envelopment analysis model to estimate relative efficiency and productivity changes in 141 Indian pharmaceutical firms during 2000-2001 to 2012-2013 which encompass pre- and post-product patent regimes. The present study found negative impact of Product Patent Act on the efficiency scores. The technological change factor is found to have played positive role in the growth of productivity, whereas technical efficiency change depicts the judicious utilization of input resources for improving performance. A sensitivity analysis with the inclusion of R&D expenditure in input variables, confirmed the validity of our selected variables. It found marginal bearing of new patent regime on the efficiency of R&D active firms, though it was found to have significantly impacted efficiency scores of large firms, R&D intensive firms, and group-owned firms. The study reported that large size, R&D intensive, private-foreign owned and those engaged in drug formulations exhibit better performance. Further, it is found that ownership, capital imports intensity and size have a positive and significant relationship with efficiency scores, whereas the age, time dummy and size square variables are inversely related. The results suggest that Indian firms need substantive improvements in efficiency by adopting best managerial practices, ensuring optimum utilization of resources, and investing significantly in the technology and products innovation.",2020,Business & Economics,1

However, since courts are expected to be neutral and act independently, a question arises whether (and why) they discriminate against foreign firms. We argue that the courts are nationalistic, which emanates from judges differentiating between in-group (domestic) and out-group (foreign) members. In a sample of 58,754 patent disputes adjudicated by US federal district courts between 1983 and 2016, we find domestic patent holders and challengers are more successful than their foreign counterparts. Rulings involving foreign firms are more likely to exhibit nationalistic rhetoric. Judicial ideology moderates the differential odds of success between domestic and foreign firms. Thus, the legal system is another source of economic nationalism.Managerial SummaryMultinational firms might face a disadvantage relative to domestic firms because politicians and regulators are nationalistic; they routinely adopt policies that favor domestic firms. If courts are neutral, this disadvantage should not exist in litigation between multinational and domestic firms. On the contrary, if courts are also nationalistic, domestic firms should enjoy an advantage and greater success than multinational firms in judicial verdicts. Using data on patent disputes in the United States observed over a 33-year period, we find domestic patent holders and challengers are more successful than their foreign counterparts suggesting that the legal system is another source of economic nationalism. Rulings involving multinationals are more likely to exhibit nationalistic rhetoric.

This study analyzes the economic impacts of a theoretical international agreement that eliminates patent rights for any nuclear aggressor (i.e., free global compulsory licensing of all intellectual property (IP) for a nuclear aggressor). The results found that all but one of the nuclear states would have a significant economic disincentive to start a nuclear attack if the proposal was put into force. Payback times ranged from 1.2 to 40 years, where the entire GDP of a nuclear aggressor would be needed to offset the loss for aggression, indicate such a mechanism as a whole would be an effective nuclear deterrent. This method would not be universally effective without ensuring all nuclear states are members of the international economy and IP processes. With the growth of open-source products and reduced value of patents, this mechanism does have a limited effectiveness time. Currently it appears to be a policy trajectory worthy of future work that can enhance safety from nuclear threat without causing harm to countries of goodwill.",2022,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
"Myco Indus., Inc. v.

On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed and vacated the preliminary injunction, finding that the district court had abused its discretion. The Federal Circuit pointed out that federal law requires a showing of bad faith before a patentee can be enjoined from communicating his patent rights, and that a showing of bad faith must be supported by a finding that the claims asserted were objectively baseless, i.e., that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits. In this case, the district court neither made a finding of bad faith nor even adverted to the requirement. To the extent the district court made any factual findings relevant to bad faith, moreover, it had expressly declined to find that any of BlephEx's statements were either false or misleading. The Federal Circuit also vacated the district court's finding that the plaintiff was likely to succeed on merits of its non-infringement contention, pointing to serious errors in the district court's claim construction and infringement analysis, such as the court's habit of frequently conflating the invention claimed in the patent with the patentee's product.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1
"Accountability, secrecy, and innovation in AI-enabled clinical decision software",machine learning; clinical decision software; accountability; secrecy; innovation; intellectual property; PATENT; ECONOMICS,"This article employs analytical and empirical tools to dissect the complex relationship between secrecy, accountability, and innovation incentives in clinical decision software enabled bymachine learning (ML-CD). Although secrecy can provide incentives for innovation, it can also diminish the ability of third parties to adjudicate risk and benefit responsibly. Our first aim is descriptive. We address how the interrelated regimes of intellectual property law, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation, and tort liability are currently shaping information flow and innovation incentives. We find that developers regard secrecy over training data and details of the trained model as central to competitive advantage. Meanwhile, neither FDA nor adopters are currently asking for these types of details. In addition, in some cases, it is not clear whether developers are being asked to provide rigorous evidence of performance. FDA, Congress, developers, and adopters could all do more to promote information flow, particularly as ML-CD models move into areas of higher risk. We provide specific suggestions for how FDA regulation, patent law, and tort liability could be tweaked to improve information flow without sacrificing innovation incentives.",2021,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,1

Technology Improvement Rate (TIR) is a measure that describes a technology's rate of performance improvement, and is represented in a generalization of Moore's Law. Estimating TIR is important for R&D purposes to forecast which competing technologies have a higher chance of success in the future. The present contribution estimates the TIR for different subdomains of applied and industrial AI by quantifying each subdomain's centrality in the global flow of technology, as modeled by the Patent Citation Network and shown in previous work. The estimated TIR enables us to quantify and compare the performance improvement of different AI methods. We also discuss the influencing factors behind slower or faster improvement rates. Our results highlight the importance of Rule-based Machine Learning (not to be confused with Rule-based Systems), Multi-task Learning, Meta-Learning, and Knowledge Representation in the future advancement of AI and particularly in Deep Learning.",2024,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,1
Patents for self-replicating technologies: Game theoretic analysis of genetically modified seed,evolutionary game theory; genetically modified organisms; intellectual property rights; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; BT COTTON; MODIFIED CROPS; MODIFIED FOOD; COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; FARM-LEVEL; ADOPTION; GM; BIOTECHNOLOGY,"This paper examines the implications of patents for farmers' decisions to use genetically modified (GM) seed versus traditional non-GM seed. We consider a game theoretic approach employing the replicator equation to assess the conditions for farmers' adoption decisions. The results show that farmers may choose GM seeds even when this decision leads to lower profits than using traditional seeds. This result emerges because of the self-replicating characteristic of the technology of seeds and their dispersion via acts of nature and/or intentional infringement. This result is robust across our baseline model and extended model that includes the option for farmers to intentionally infringe upon the GM seed technology. This result is also robust with respect to a wide range of initial conditions and parameter values representing economic conditions including the dispersal of the GM technology, monitoring effort, payoff of GM seed relative to traditional seed, cost of patent infringement, cost of contamination, and added cost of legally using GM seed.",2020,Government & Law,1
Patterns of collaboration for technology transfer in Spanish universities,University patents; collaboration; knowledge generation; technology transfer; BAYH-DOLE ACT; TRIPLE-HELIX; INNOVATION SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE; NETWORKS; INTERNATIONALIZATION; ORGANIZATIONS; DETERMINANTS; INDICATORS; FIRMS,"Universities are relevant actors in research and development (R&D) and, increasingly, in innovation. These institutions play a significant role in the generation and transfer of scientific and technical knowledge. They may also adopt an orchestration role, in order to combine diverse national and international sources of knowledge through collaboration networks that can enhance their ability to transfer it to industry and society. In this paper, we seek to demonstrate that, if this pattern is confirmed, larger benefits can be achieved and translated into better performance and greater impacts on the development of local innovation ecosystems. Using data on patents granted to universities by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 1990 to 2017, we study the technological performance of Spanish universities to illustrate how collaboration patterns affect the relative impact on their innovative activities. Our contribution identifies a dual complementary and geographically dispersed pattern of collaboration in the evolution of universities' technological performance, while the existence of public-private partnerships and the generation of international linkages are found to be prevalent factors (even dominant over R&D).",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,1
COMPULSORY LICENSES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PATENTS IN CHINA IN LIGHT OF THE TRIPS AGREEMENT,compulsory license; pharmaceutical patents; TRIPS flexibility; the balance of interests; China; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; SYSTEM,"The recurrence of public health emergencies has made the issue of access to drugs a pertinent problem for developing countries. As a public health safeguard, the compulsory license system for patented pharmaceuticals is embodied in the international intellectual property (hereinafter IP) norms related to public health. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter TRIPS Agreement) flexibility is a double-edged sword for the pharmaceutical patent system in developing countries. On the one hand, the exception clauses to IP protection under the TRIPS Agreement, especially the compulsory licensing system, give member states the possibility of exempting their treaty obligations in the event of a public health crisis. On the other hand, the different interpretations deriving from the ambiguity of TRIPS ''flexibility defer members from implementing compulsory licensing in response to a public health crisis. China has established a systematic set of rules, including legislation and policies on compulsory licensing and integrated the TRIPS flexibility into Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). However, it still lacks clear procedural provisions regarding the compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical patents in the context of the public health crisis, which affects China's ability to use TRIPS flexibility of Compulsory licenses effectively.Furthermore, China's compulsory license law is never implemented despite the increasing need to ensure drug access and effectively respond to public health emergencies. This article aims to assess China's compulsory license system in light of the TRIPS Agreement. The article analyses how and why China's domestic compulsory license system fails to take advantage of TRIPS flexibility in substance and implementation. It suggests points for reform to enhance China's compulsory license system for pharmaceutical patents, which can effectively be utilized in public health emergencies, as well as heading towards better integration and implementation of the TRIPS flexibility, referring to the interest-balanced guiding principle.",2023,Health Care Sciences & Services; International Relations; Government & Law,1
The role of research outcome quality in the relationship between university research collaboration and technology transfer: empirical results from China,Research collaboration; Technology transfer; Outcome quality; Patent reassignment; University patents; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; BAYH-DOLE ACT; NATIONAL INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; PATENT QUALITY; UNITED-STATES; INDUSTRY; US; COMMERCIALIZATION; ENTERPRISES,"This paper aims to determine whether and how quality of research outcome mediates the relationship between university research collaboration and technology transfer. Based on the resource-based view, we propose and test several hypotheses on the relationships between research collaboration, outcome quality and technology transfer using Chinese universities' granted patents in USPTO. The findings suggest that the size of university research collaboration has an inverted U-shaped influence on their outcome quality and that university collaboration with firms-compared with other academic institutions-has a positive influence on outcome quality. In turn, the quality of research outcome has a positive influence on the technology transfer. Furthermore, there is a partial mediating role of outcome quality in the relationships between university research collaboration and technology transfer. The size and type of university research collaboration affect technology transfer indirectly; through outcome quality. Specifically, outcome quality has a mediation effect on the relationship between collaboration size and technology transfer when collaboration size is not too large. Outcome quality has a partial mediation effect on the relationship between collaboration type (collaboration with firms) and technology transfer. Our findings provide new insights into the process of university technology transfer taking into account the idiosyncrasies of institutional environments in emerging countries such as China.",2020,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,1
A FRAGILITY THEORY OF TRADEMARK FUNCTIONALITY,; BRAND; GOODS; CONSUMERS; MEDICATION; PREFERENCE; ANTITRUST; TASTE,"According to functionality doctrine, trademark protection cannot be granted for any feature that is essential to a product's use or purpose, or that affects the product's cost or quality. But because of the placebo effect, even seemingly inert names and symbols are imbued with precisely this kind of power. In fact, a wide variety of realworld phenomena challenge the prevailing understanding of trademark functionality, from the social uses of high-fashion marks to the cost reductions enabled by certification marks. More fundamentally, a valuable trademark of any kind should act to reduce search costs for consumers and improve quality through reputation. And yet, rather than leading to invalidation, all of these well-documented functionalities are apparently tolerated by trademark law-sometimes merely ignored, but often celebrated explicitly. This Article proposes a more unified theory of functionality: fragility. Some product features affect cost, quality, use, and purpose in ways that are non-fragilethe effects would persist even if every producer were to copy the same feature. But some features affect the product in ways that are fragile-the effects would be degraded or broken through unchecked copying. In reality, only non-fragile functionalities are actually prohibited, whereas fragile functionalities are permitted and even encouraged. In a manner surprisingly similar to patent or copyright law, trademark law appears to carefully distinguish between improvements that require its protection in order to manifest, and those that do not. This fragility theory not only better explains real-world case outcomes and the functionality doctrine's full history, but also offers a conceptual improvement that can be applied to all types of trademarks. A generic term, for example, exhibits non-fragile linguistic functionality. Moreover, fragility theory provides consistent answers to divisive boundary issues in trademark law, such as overlapping protection under copyright, anti-dilution rights, and post-sale confusion doctrine. At the same time, recognizing this fragility pattern calls attention to potentially adverse consequences in terms of distributive justice and market competition-consequences that trademark law itself may not be able to remedy.",2021,Government & Law,1
Intellectual property law in the field of sports: specifics of manifestations and features of legal regulation,WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization); Intellectual Property; Trademark; Design; Image Rights; ,"The article aims to explore the relationships that arise with respect to intellectual property rights in sports. The objectives of the article are to establish points of contact between intellectual property law and sports, as well as a detailed analysis of relevant public relations in terms of intellectual property law and sports law. To achieve the objectives of the article, the authors used a number of scientific methods, among which the main methods are analysis, synthesis and comparative-legal method. The authors of the study concluded that modern sport is developing in close intertwining with intellectual property rights, because only in this way can a sports spectacle be conveyed to a wide range of spectators and consumers in a broad sense. In addition, the range of points of contact between intellectual property and sports law is constantly growing and such can now be called not only patents and trademarks in sports, but also copyright, image rights, know-how in sports and the like.",2021,Government & Law,1

The panel estimation techniques are used for annual data for the period of 1990-2018. The empirical evidence affirms that patent rights and innovation act as a policy factor in controlling carbon intensity, i.e. creativity leads to energy-efficient and environment friendly society. However, innovations have higher magnitude compared to patent. Contrarily, urbanization and economic growth are the key determinants in enhancing carbon intensity, while renewable energy has insignificant impact on carbon intensity. The empirical analysis, especially for creativity, can add practical implications for related authorities in controlling carbon intensity and improving energy efficiency.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Medical Countermeasures for Pandemic Response and Intellectual Property Rights Articulating and Enabling Community Interests under International Law,medical countermeasures against COVID-19; immunization as a global public good; community interests under international law; international intellectual property rights; TRIPS Agreement; TRADE,"The current article addresses the question of whether and under which circumstances access to medical countermeasures against pandemics, such as COVID-19, may constitute a community interest under international law. First, the intertwined concepts of global public goods and community interests arc fleshed out. Second, the analysis expounds whether the protection against pandemics, including immunization, can be framed as a community interest, and which obligations would result. Third, the relationship between community interests and intellectual property rights as enshrined in international law is explored. Fourth, the conclusions try to reconcile the goals of international intellectual property rights and the protection against pandemics. Positive obligations to furnish medical countermeasures may not attain the consent of a sufficiently large number of states. Nevertheless, articulating the protection against pandemics as a community interest should entail obligations to refrain from resorting to international intellectual property law to impede developing patent-protected medical countermeasures in other countries.",2022,Government & Law,1

Starting in 2000, Delaware, followed by several other states, allowed boards to waive their duty. We show that public firms covered by waiver laws invest less in R&D, produce fewer and less valuable patents, and exhibit abnormally high inventor departures. Remaining innovation activities contribute less to firm value, a fact confirmed by the market reaction when firms reveal their curtailed internal growth opportunities by announcing acquisitions. Consistent with the laws' intent to provide contracting flexibility to emerging firms, we find evidence of positive impacts for small firms.",2023,Business & Economics,1

Both are developments of the last four decades. In this paper, we look at how change in antitrust and patent law and thus change in market power in the largest four subsectors of healthcare, hospitals, physician groups, prescription drugs, and net medical insurance, have contributed to the increasing cost of medical care in the United States. We show that the annual rent - the degree to which health care is overpriced as a result of market power - was between 2.47 and 4.30 percent of GDP in 2016 - truly a big cost for big medicine.",2022,Business & Economics,1
The Patents Māori Advisory Committee of Aotearoa New Zealand: Lessons for indigenous knowledge protection,indigenous knowledge; New Zealand; patent law; ,"Using freedom of information requests, we examine the operation of the Patents Maori Advisory Committee of Aotearoa New Zealand. The Committee advises the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand on whether inventions claimed in a patent application are derived from Maori traditional knowledge or from indigenous plants or animals; and if so, whether the commercial exploitation of that invention is likely to be contrary to Maori values. There is limited publicly available information on the operations of the Committee and the decision-making process undertaken in reviewing applications. The requests and our searches identified 13 patents referred to the Committee, of which most (9 of 13) dealt with inventions related to Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), a taonga species known for its role in producing unique honey. Only two applications have been found to be contrary to Maori values, and these applications have both since been abandoned. The review of applications found to be 'not contrary to Maori values' is instructive, identifying important considerations taken into account by the Committee in reaching a decision, including the importance of benefit sharing and engagement with Maori in considering whether an invention may be contrary to Maori values. The analysis highlights the limitations of the Committee in reviewing only those applications filed in Aotearoa New Zealand and referred to the Committee for advice and identifies the importance of mechanisms such as disclosure of origin to ensure all relevant applications are reviewed by the Committee. The paper concludes by highlighting how the operation of the Committee may inform the development of similar bodies in other jurisdictions, such as Australia.",2024,Government & Law,1

Grounded in the work of critical race theory and intellectual property scholars, this study analyzes the inconsistencies in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office application practice. The contradictions signal a limited or misunderstanding of the utility of citizen-created hashtags and online social movement slogans. We propose a provisional networked trademark that would grant limited protection to social movements to show that their marks demonstrate the kind of secondary meaning required for a traditional trademark.",2021,Communication,1
THE FLEXIBLE DYNAMICS OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REGIME TO DEAL WITH HEALTH EMERGENCIES: CASE STUDIES FROM AIDS AND COVID-19,Intellectual property; compulsory licences; health crises; health; innovation; ,"The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that intellectual property rights become flexible enough to expand the supply of medicines and vaccines, in addition to enabling development and innovation. In order to understand this dynamic, we started with a systematic literature review, with the object of analyzing three case studies in which the performance of different international and national actors is observed. The first deals with the legislative actions in the country, which made possible the decree of the compulsory license of the Efavirenz patent, by the Executive Power in 2007, during the sanitary crisis of AIDS. The second demonstrates that the Covid-19 pandemic was strong enough to spur vaccine innovation and development; but it still has problems with production capacity, whose solution proposed at the World Trade Organization (WTO) was the waiver of patents. Finally, the Brazilian Judiciary, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, made the Intellectual Property Law more flexible, by removing the sole paragraph of art. 40 of the Law of Intellectual Property (LPI), in Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADI) 5,529, and the Power promoted several changes in the LPI, to face the crisis. It is concluded that the dynamics of the norms that govern Intellectual Property Law allow for different possibilities of flexibility, depending on each concrete problem, to function as a kind of emergency intellectual property right.",2023,Government & Law,1
Evolution of the Chinese Intellectual Property Rights System: IPR Law Revisions and Enforcement,China; intellectual property protection; legal enforcement; INSTITUTION-BASED VIEW; PROTECTION; REFORM,"Since the first Trademark Law was enacted in China in 1982, the Chinese intellectual property rights (IPR) system has undergone significant changes in both the design of the legislation and its enforcement. In this article, we analyze the evolution of IPR legislation and enforcement in China. To this end, we illustrate the evolutionary changes of the Chinese IPR system and analyze the changes introduced in four revisions (1992-1993, 2000-2001, 2008-2013, and 2019-2020). Our analysis shows that Patent Law, Trademark Law, and Copyright Law have been substantially enhanced, especially since 2000, when China improved its IPR system to comply with the TRIPS Agreement and join the WTO, and especially the most recent amendments of these three IP Laws. We discuss the number of IPR infringement cases handled by both relevant administrative authorities and courts to analyze IPR enforcement in China. Results indicate that the development of IPR protection enforcement followed the improvement of relevant IPR laws. The two revisions introduced after 2008, changes in the Chinese IPR system, and an increasing number of IPR infringement cases handled by relevant authorities also suggest the willingness of the Chinese government to further enhance its IPR protection.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Analysing the current status of open access patent repositories: a global perspective,Open access repositories; Web 2.0 tools; OAI-PMH; OpenDOAR; Open access policies; Patents; INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORIES; BANGLADESH,"PurposeAccess to patent-related information is facilitated in large part by repositories of patents. Additionally, patent repositories support transparency and knowledge exchange, both of which can spark new alliances and collaborations. In addition to serving as a source of inspiration for future inventions, they allow companies, researchers and inventors to look up current patents and prevent infringement. Globally, the scientific and academic communities are becoming increasingly interested in open-access repositories. Countries throughout the world have kept up their repositories because of their significance. A directory of open access repositories (OpenDOAR) is a reliable source with minimally inaccurate or dubious content, having been meticulously chosen and validated. It acts as a global registration hub, enabling the visibility and accessibility of research contributions. Hence, this study aims to look into the current status of open-access repositories for archiving Patents, at the global level in OpenDOAR by analysing the different characteristic features of repositories.Design/methodology/approachThe advanced search strategy of the directory of open-access repositories (www.opendoar.org/) is used to extract the data. The data extraction process was carried out on 28th March 2023. The study limited its search to Patents only, among the different content types listed in it. A total of 253 repositories were retrieved that contained the selected content type. However, the advanced search feature was combined one by one with other available parameters to retrieve the data. The gathered data was saved in MS Excel for further analysis. Moreover, the open access policies, open archives initiative protocol for metadata harvesting (OAI-PMH) and language interface of repositories were manually looked up from each repository/record information. To present the findings, charts and tables were used to visualize the gathered data effectively.FindingsThe study shows that repositories have increased over the years, with the highest number established in 2022. The UK has emerged as the most prominent country contributing to the development of repositories for archiving patents. The majority of the repositories are institutional, and DSpace is the most commonly used software for their creation. While Web 2.0 tools are not widely used, however, a significant number of repositories have incorporated RSS feeds, Atom and social media. Open access policies play a vital role in managing the content archived in the repositories, and only a small percentage of the repositories were found to be following them. However, the majority of the repositories have shown OAI-PMH compliance. English is the most commonly preferred interface language by repositories for archiving patents. These findings suggest that there is still significant room for improvement in the development and management of repositories, and adherence to open-access policies could play a crucial role in ensuring their sustainability and usefulness in the future.Originality/valueTo the best of the author's knowledge, the study is the first of its type that examines the global landscape of open-access patent repositories.",2024,Information Science & Library Science,1
Vietnam's Regulation on Intellectual Property Rights Protection: The Context of Digital Transformation,Digital transformation; Copyright; Patents; Intellectual property rights; ,"Vietnam is home to a prospering technology community and numerous enterprises that range from small start-ups to development giants. Virtually all public services are offered online. In fact, the country even has a system for e-residency and data embassies. This achievement derives in part from the nation's transparent and enduring political preferences, but more importantly from Vietnamese law and its regulatory system regarding information, the digital general public, and intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. In this examination of the most pertinent aspects of Vietnam's digital economy legislation, this study explores the nation's regulatory structure regarding copyright and patents within the context of digital transformation. The study discusses the relationship between foreign and national regulations in terms of IPR protection and the advancement of digitalization. Research on Vietnamese regulations and the practical application of major patent and copyright regulations has revealed that in many respects, the nation is highly reliant on the effective operation of a broader foreign institutional and legal framework. Thus, in the near future, technological advancement will necessitate the establishment of additional transnational regulatory systems.",2024,Government & Law; Linguistics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
"Syngenta Crop Prot., LLC v. Willowood, LLC United States Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit, 2019 No. 2018-1614, 2019 WL 6884529, _F.3d _",; ,"Syngenta markets fungicide products containing the active ingredient azoxystrobin. Willowood filed applications with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to register generic me-too'' versions of Syngenta's azoxystrobin-based products, and Syngenta sued for copyright infringement, based on Willowood's copying of Syngenta's corresponding product labels. The district court dismissed the copyright claims, finding that because the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) contemplates copying by a generic applicant in ways that would otherwise infringe copyright, Congress intended a narrow exception to copyright protection for the required elements of a fungicide label. On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed, holding that unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act, which requires a generic drug to have essentially the same label as its branded counterpart, FIFRA does not necessarily mandate that a generic fungicide use the same label as its branded counterpart, and for that reason does not necessarily preempt the Copyright Act. The district court further found that Syngenta had not proven that Willowood infringed patents claiming methods of manufacturing azoxystrobin under 35 U.S.C. 271(g), based on the court's assumption that 271(g) infringement requires that a single entity perform all of the steps of a claimed method. The Federal Circuit reversed, holding that while 271(a) does require all of the steps of an infringing process to be attributable to a single party, there is no such limitation on 271(g). The Federal Circuit pointed out that the infringing act creating liability under 271(g) is the importation into the U.S. of a product manufactured using a process that is patented in the U.S., and that Congress did not intend to limit the application of 271(g) to situations in which a single entity performs all of the steps of the claimed method.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1
SEPs licensing across the supply chain: an antitrust perspective,standard essential patents; licensing levels; FRAND; supply chain; automotive industry; antitrust; FRAND COMMITMENTS; PATENTS,"The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of 5G are set to add a new layer of complexity to the current practice of standard essential patents (SEPs) licensing. While, until recently, the debate has centred on the nature of fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) commitments and the mechanisms to avoid hold-up and reverse hold-up problems between licensors and licensees, a new hotly-debated issue has now emerged. At its core is the question of whether SEP holders should be required to grant a FRAND licence to any implementer seeking a licence, including component makers (the so-called 'licence-to-all' approach), or if they should be allowed freely to target the supply-chain level at which the licence is to be granted (the so-called 'access-for-all' approach). After providing an up-to-date overview of the current legal and economic debate, this article focuses on the most recent antitrust case law dealing with the matter on both sides of the Atlantic and argues that no sound economic and legal bases which favour licence-to-all solutions can be identified.",2021,Government & Law,1
Rise of the (3D printing) machines in healthcare,3D printing; Pharmaceuticals; Intellectual property; Additive manufacturing; Patent law; Innovation; Regulatory development; TABLETS; PHARMACEUTICALS; FORMULATION; FABRICATION,"Three-dimensional printing (3D printing) or additive manufacturing first came to prominence in the field of engineering, in particular in the transport sector where the value of its fast and accurate prototyping and manufacture of spare parts was quickly recognised. However, over the last ten years, this revolutionary technology has disrupted established manufacture in an increasingly diverse range of technical areas. Perhaps the most unexpected of these is pharmaceuticals - not merely the manufacture of products such as surgically inserted implants, but also of dosage formulations themselves - now available in all manner of printed delivery forms and vehicles and showing promising control of release properties though 3D printing process choices. This review will provide an overview of how 3D printing technology has developed and expanded across technological boundaries during the past decade, with a closer look at the current opportunities and barriers to its widespread adoption, particularly in the medical and pharmaceutical sectors.

Thus, we contribute to knowledge of new investment models in entrepreneurial finance and how they manage agency risks.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Intangible Assets and the Financialized Business Enterprise: A Veblen-Commons Approach,business enterprise; intangible assets; financialization; Thorstein Veblen; John Commons; DIFFERENTIAL ACCUMULATION; PATENTS; INNOVATION; DICHOTOMY; ECONOMY; COSTS; AYRES,"In the Veblen-Commons view of the business enterprise as going concern, the primary goal of the enterprise is to engage in sequential acts of production through time. To that end, intangible assets play a crucial role in providing a differential advantage, granting the owners an income stream separate from normal activity that more easily allows them to achieve this purpose. Therefore, understanding the business enterprise from a Veblen-Commons perspective requires first and foremost an understanding of the way in which such assets confer this differential advantage. In doing so, two things become clear: First, such assets are grounded in law and accounting, and as such, any discussion of them must include a discussion of how they emerge in a legal process and how accountants treat them on the balance sheet. Second, as the enterprise evolves, so too does the form of the differential advantage. This article incorporates both of these points to provide a clear, coherent framework of intangible assets within the business enterprise from a Veblen-Commons perspective that can be used to understand a financialized economy.",2020,Business & Economics,1
Reimagining Pharmaceutical Market Exclusivities: Should the Duration of Guaranteed Monopoly Periods Be Value Based?,data exclusivities; drug pricing; healthcare reform; health law; health spending; health technology assessment; patents; pharmaceutical policy; PATENTS; DRUGS,"Objectives: To describe the main features of a pharmaceutical market in which the duration of guaranteed monopoly periods would correspond to a new pharmaceutical product's value. Methods: After reviewing patent and regulatory exclusivity-based mechanisms for protecting prescription drug markets from competition to incentivize drug innovation in developed countries, we model market protection mechanisms within the current framework to give the longest-lasting market protections to drug developers that bring the most affordable products to market with highest public health and clinical value. Results: An approach tying pharmaceutical market exclusivity to value would have 3 main features. First, it would be based on regulatory exclusivity (ie, the drug regulator refrains from authorizing generic entry for a certain amount of time), rather than patents. Second, the duration of exclusivity period would be pegged to the magnitude of a product's anticipated health impact and its proposed price by using modified methods from the field of health technology assessment. Third, the duration of the value-based exclusivity period would be reassessed routinely 3 years after the product's launch to account for its realworld effectiveness. Conclusions: Linking a drug's proposed price to the duration of its regulatory-based exclusivities would both incentivize the development of high impact, low-cost products and motivate drug developers to introduce these products at lower prices.",2021,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,1

Just as pills contain an active pharmacological ingredient so too do they contain active legal ingredients. Where the molecular composition of pills are designed by chemists their legal-semic aspects are designed by lawyers. These are collaborative projects. Where the former are interested in the effects of molecules at bio-sites, the latter are concerned with the effects of legal signifiers in relation to each other as interpreted in a range of hermeneutic sites through cultural practices of reading and meta-reading. These meanings are built into the molecule itself thus resulting in the fabrication of legal molecules.",2021,Government & Law,1

The risk of complications are enhanced by poor glycaemic control including hypoglycaemia. Long-acting insulin analogues were developed to reduce hypoglycaemia and improve adherence. Their considerably higher costs though have impacted their funding and use. Biosimilars can help reduce medicine costs. However, their introduction has been affected by a number of factors. These include the originator company dropping its price as well as promoting patented higher strength 300 IU/ml insulin glargine. There can also be concerns with different devices between the manufacturers. Objective: To assess current utilisation rates for insulins, especially long-acting insulin analogues, and the rationale for patterns seen, across multiple countries to inform strategies to enhance future utilisation of long-acting insulin analogue biosimilars to benefit all key stakeholders. Our approach: Multiple approaches including assessing the utilisation, expenditure and prices of insulins, including biosimilar insulin glargine, across multiple continents and countries. Results: There was considerable variation in the use of long-acting insulin analogues as a percentage of all insulins prescribed and dispensed across countries and continents. This ranged from limited use of long-acting insulin analogues among African countries compared to routine funding and use across Europe in view of their perceived benefits. Increasing use was also seen among Asian countries including Bangladesh and India for similar reasons. However, concerns with costs and value limited their use across Africa, Brazil and Pakistan. There was though limited use of biosimilar insulin glargine 100 IU/ml compared with other recent biosimilars especially among European countries and Korea. This was principally driven by small price differences in reality between the originator and biosimilars coupled with increasing use of the patented 300 IU/ml formulation. A number of activities were identified to enhance future biosimilar use. These included only reimbursing biosimilar long-acting insulin analogues, introducing prescribing targets and increasing competition among manufacturers including stimulating local production. Conclusions: There are concerns with the availability and use of insulin glargine biosimilars despite lower costs. This can be addressed by multiple activities.",2021,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1

Preliminary conclusions on preferences in choice of countries for patenting and fields where innovations are made have been given. It is well known that the development of a competitive economy depends on the innovative activity of enterprises in the market. Understanding of terminology of innovation and invention opens up their economic and legal essence. A special and basic characteristic of innovation is creativity. In the Japanese business and management system, creativity is a production slogan and an inspiring idea, since creativity generates a person's desire to improve in work through intelligence. A product that is new on a global level is recognized as an invention and is regulated by patent law. The state of the art for the invention includes all information that became publicly available in the world before the date of applying with the State Department of intellectual property. The aim of our study is to analyze the economic aspect of patenting made by the innovative companies in the world with attention to Russia, taking into account the role of innovation infrastructure. Modern concepts of innovative development of economic systems at various levels (state, region, industry, business entity) increasingly focus on the need for new forms of integration of scientific, industrial, commercial, and other resources to increase competitiveness. Domestic and foreign researchers, government, and business representatives pay attention to clusters as a promising form of integration and practical implementation of the idea of Public-Private Partnership for Innovative Industrial Development. The cluster approach allows combining the advantages of specialization, integration, and cooperation in increasing the competitiveness of business entities in a higher-level organizational and economic system (regional, industry cluster) by consolidating production, financial, intellectual, and managerial resources. Clustering of the innovation system in industry allows transition from supporting individual production enterprises or organizations that carry out scientific research to stimulating the development of relationships between them and other subjects of commercialization of scientific research.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Matching With Complementary Contracts,Complementarities; matching with contracts; stability; contract design; COMPETITIVE-EQUILIBRIUM; STABILITY; NETWORKS; DESIGN,"In this paper, we show that stable outcomes exist in matching environments with complementarities, such as social media platforms or markets for patent licenses. Our results apply to both nontransferable and transferable utility settings, and allow for multilateral agreements and those with externalities. In particular, we show that stable outcomes in these settings are characterized by the largest fixed point of a monotone operator, and so can be found using an algorithm; in the nontransferable utility case, this is aone-sideddeferred acceptance algorithm, rather than a Gale-Shapley algorithm. We also give a monotone comparative statics result as well as a comparative static on the effect of bundling contracts together. These illustrate the impact of design decisions, such as increased privacy protections on social media, or the use of antitrust law to disallow patent pools, on stable outcomes.",2020,Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,1
Biotechnology and Intellectual Property Law: Theoretical and Practical Reflections on Albanian National Law and Jurisprudence in Comparison with EU Acquis and ECJ Case Law,biotechnology; intellectual property rights; EU acquis; Albanian legislation; legal approximation; ,"Biotechnology is a fast-emerging sector with enormous commercial and scientific development potential. It is impossible to overstate the prominence of intellectual property (IP) in securing and fostering innovation in the biotechnology sector. Albania, as a candidate country for EU membership, has made significant efforts to align its legislation with the EU acquis, including in the field of biotechnology and IP. The ambit of biotechnology and intellectual property laws in Albania includes patent law, trade secrets, and plant variety rights. In general, Albania's law is mostly aligned with the EU acquis, while there are a few areas that need additional development. For instance, further work is needed to define the perquisites for patentability and expand the scope of protection afforded to biotechnological innovations in Albania. There have not been many high-stakes court decisions in Albania concerning biotechnology and intellectual property, hence the country's case law is still evolving. In comparison to the EU, Albanian laws and case law in the fields of biotechnology and intellectual property are still in their infancy. Nonetheless, Albania has made substantial progress in aligning its legislation with the EU acquis, and its judges are becoming more conversant with EU case law. Albania's legislation and case law in this field is projected to continue converging with those of the EU as the country draws closer to EU membership, which will assist to encourage innovation and economic development in Albania.",2023,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1
The Antibody Patent Paradox,; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; DOCTRINE; TOLERANCE; THERAPIES; HISTORY; POLICY; VIRUS,"Antibodies constitute a staggering $145 billion annual market-an amount projected to almost double by 2026. Consequently, patents covering antibodies are among the most valuable in the patent system. But antibody patents are being struck down left and right, victims of the Federal Circuit's recent shift to strengthen two doctrinal areas of patent law: enablement and the written description requirement. For each, the Federal Circuit has heightened requirements that patentees disclose or teach how to make and use the full scope  of their inventions.There are good reasons to be skeptical of the Federal Circuit's attack on genus claims in chemistry generally. But it seems to be a particular problem for antibodies. Applying the Federal Circuit's reinvigorated written description and enablement requirements to antibodies and their chemical structure fits poorly with the science underlying the molecules themselves. Immune -receptor production, a semi-random and galactically expansive process, produces antibodies that are startlingly different in both structure and function. There is no way to describe genus claims to antibodies that satisfy the court's current tests. The science simply doesn't allow it. At the same time, this change in the Federal Circuit's jurisprudence is a legitimate reaction to some of the problems with the long-standing (and long-permitted) practice of claiming antibodies in functional terms. Functional claiming can lead to overbroad patents that stifle future innovation, as it has done in the software industry. Perhaps the Federal Circuit is wary of a similar result in biotechnology. Fortunately, we think there is a middle ground. A new (or, really, quite old) form of patent -claim drafting would give inventors effective control over true substitutes without giving them the power to block real improvements: means-plus-function claims and infringement by the equivalents. Those doctrines limit patentees to claiming only the specific structural features of antibodies they both possessed and described, but also entitle them to assert their patents against antibodies with equivalent functions but different structural characteristics. If the economics of intellectual property center on balancing a need for protection beyond the literal invention with a desire to allow improvements, this seems a step in the right-or, at least in a doctrinally permissible and economically sensible-direction.Whether patentees go for such a solution remains to be seen. Recent empirical evidence on antibody claims has yet to document such a shift. Patent attorneys may need to get over their his-torical reluctance to writing their claims in such a fashion. Our solution won't give patentees eve-rything they want. But they just might find it gives them what they need.",2023,Government & Law,1
Oil discoveries and innovation,Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives; Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital; Resource Booms; Comparative Studies of Countries; Exhaustible Resources and Economic Development; Institutions and Growth; NATURAL-RESOURCE BOOMS; CURSE; INVESTMENT,"This paper explores the effects of giant oil discoveries on innovation for a sample of 179 countries for the period 1975-2005. Evidence indicates that innovation activity slows down after oil discovery. Using a difference-indifferences design, we show that, on average, patent citations decline by 2.4% per year, and the number of actual patents slows down by approximately 2.5% per year. These results are consistent with the notion of the natural resource curse, a phenomenon where resource-rich economies have inferior growth performance relative to resource-poor economies. Cross-sectional analyses indicate that changes in innovation activities are greater in common law countries. We show that governance quality is a possible channel through which a decline in innovative activity occurs after a resource windfall.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Patient and Payer Incentives to Use Patented Brand-Name Drugs vs Authorized Generic Drugs in Medicare Part D,; ,"This cross-sectional study of Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Formulary and Pricing Information Files and Medicare Part D plan enrollment assessed examined coverage for 4 brand-name insulin drugs and direct-acting antiviral agents and their authorized generic formulations. Questions Are authorized generic versions of insulin and direct-acting antiviral agents for hepatitis C covered by Medicare Part D plans, and do they provide value for patients, plans, and the Medicare program compared with the brand-name drug? Findings This cross-sectional study of Medicare formulary and pricing data for quarter 3 of 2020 found that most Part D plans offered brand-name drug-only or both brand-name and authorized generic drug coverage. Although Medicare beneficiaries who filled insulin and direct-acting antiviral prescriptions would spend less out of pocket with authorized generic drug use, plans and Medicare would likely spend more on these authorized generic drugs than brand-name drugs for beneficiaries with total drug spending below Medicare's catastrophic threshold. Meaning This study suggests that authorized generic drugs available before patent expiration may lower patient spending but are unlikely to provide savings for Part D plans or Medicare, giving them little incentive to offer authorized generic drugs over brand-name drugs. Importance In response to scrutiny over high drug prices, manufacturers of insulin and direct-acting antiviral agents for treating hepatitis C have recently introduced authorized generic alternatives to their patented brand-name products. These authorized generic drugs have list prices at least 50% lower than the list price of the brand-name drugs, which should result in savings to patients. However, it is unclear whether these authorized generic drugs are offered on Medicare Part D formularies because they may not provide savings to plans or Medicare. Objective To assess Medicare Part D formulary coverage for 4 brand-name formulations of insulin and direct-acting antiviral agents and their authorized generic formulations. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Formulary and Pricing Information Files from quarter 3 of 2020 and Medicare Part D plan enrollment for September 2020. Four patented brand-name drugs (sofosbuvir and velpatasvir fixed-dose combination tablets [Epclusa], ledipasvir and sofosbuvir tablets [Harvoni], insulin lispro [Humalog], and insulin aspart [Novolog]) and their authorized generic formulations for all Part D stand-alone prescription drug plans (n = 959) and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (n = 3148) were studied. Main Outcomes and Measures Beneficiary-weighted formulary coverage of brand-name and authorized generic products; beneficiary out-of-pocket costs; and prerebate plan, manufacturer, and Medicare spending on brand-name and authorized generic products. Results In quarter 3 of 2020, 97% of beneficiaries were in plans that covered brand-name drugs only or both brand-name and authorized generic drugs; approximately 3% were in plans that covered authorized generic drugs only. Observed authorized generic drug list prices were 67%, 62%, and 50% lower than list prices for Epclusa, Harvoni, and each brand-name insulin product, respectively. Medicare beneficiaries using authorized generic drugs could save $270 per year for 12 vials of Humalog and $2974 for a full course of Harvoni. Plans, however, have limited incentives to encourage authorized generic drug use because rebates for brands likely exceed savings available with authorized generic drugs, particularly for beneficiaries with spending that reaches the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Conclusions and Relevance The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that authorized generic drugs for insulin and direct-acting antiviral agents may lower out-of-pocket spending for patients but are unlikely to provide savings for Part D plans or Medicare. Instead, these drugs allow manufacturers to offer products at a lower list price without materially lowering net prices or profits.",2021,General & Internal Medicine,1
Supporting decision making in design creativity through requirements identification and evaluation,Requirements; market potential; natural language process; decision making; patents; ,"Product innovation, based on the identification and implementation of new solutions, is essential to keep a company competitive. However, the risk of failure of a new solution must be properly weighted during the decision-making in the design activity. This study proposes a method to evaluate a new design solution through the comparison with an old one to be substituted, and based on their requirements. In order to better evaluate the new solution, new requirements about its specific peculiarities are extracted from patents of similar solutions and considered in the evaluation. Requirements extraction is carried out automatically, through natural language processing, while the evaluation considers technical, marketing, and economic criteria. In particular, financial proceeds and patents investments were considered. The proposed method was applied in a real industrial case study were the substitution of carbon fiber heating mat over the copper heating mat was assessed. This study contributes to support creativity in innovation design by providing unknown requirements on which to work on the new product. In addition, it can stimulate the designer on this aim, by presenting the requirements along with new ideas, already implementing them in other fields/contexts that can act as sources of inspiration or creativity triggers.",2023,Engineering,1

The increased susceptibility to infections in patients on hemodialysis can be attributed to decreased immunity, though age, other comorbidities, and properties of the catheter act as modifiers. Hematogenous spread of the infection can lead to sepsis and seeding into other organs. In this article, we report an unusual case of septic emboli to the brain in a 30 -year -old male on prolonged use of a right internal jugular vein (IJV) catheter for hemodialysis. An interesting finding in the case was the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO), a persisting embryonic structure that allows right -to -left shunting. It is suspected that this PFO led to the passage of septic emboli from the right IJV site to the brain. Before our case, septic emboli to the brain have been reported to occur from valvular vegetation in case of infective endocarditis. The mainstay of managing patients with septic emboli is the use of antibiotics; additional interventions may be needed on a case -to -case basis.",2024,General & Internal Medicine,1

E-fuels, which are produced using renewable electricity from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, could act as a possible large-scale solution for achieving climate-neutral mobility, as they allow us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while leveraging the existing energy infrastructure. Against such a background, it is critical to examine how the related technological landscape is constructed and might affect the subsequent knowledge generation. By adopting a social-network perspective, the aim of this study is to investigate the degree of technological knowledge relatedness of e-fuel technology using patent data. This is accomplished by analyzing the influence of individual knowledge areas and categorizing them into a matrix model, with each quadrant playing a unique role. The main findings show that the patent landscape is dominated by applications from the private sector, and the main knowledge base is centered around chemical engineering and production techniques for liquid hydrocarbon mixture. Furthermore, the analyzed knowledge flows are dominated by intra-technology knowledge flows, thereby being less prone to convergent technology evolution. In particular, the knowledge areas C10L 01 and C10J 03 demonstrated a high influencer role. The findings can also support R&D advisors and decision makers in policy development in reducing their efforts required for conducting technical intelligence activities and determining adequate policies for R&D portfolio management.",2023,Energy & Fuels,1
Idealists and capitalists: ownership attitudes and preferences in genomic citizen science,citizen science; participatory research; intellectual property; patent; commons; ETHICAL-ISSUES; LAW,"The perspectives of genomic citizen scientists on ownership of research outputs are not well understood, yet they are useful for identifying alignment of participant expectations and project practices and can help guide efforts to develop innovative tools and strategies for managing ownership claims. Here, we report findings from 52 interviews conducted in 2018 and 2019 to understand genomic citizen science stakeholders' conceptualizations of, experiences with, and preferences for ownership of research outputs. Interviewees identified four approaches for recognizing genomic citizen scientists' ownership and related credit interests in research outputs: shared governance via commons models; fractional ownership of benefits; full and creative attribution; and offensive and defensive patenting. Interviewees also agreed that the model selected by any project should at least maximize access to research outputs and, as appropriate and to the extent possible, broadly distribute rights of control and entitlements to research benefits.",2022,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences,1

Using two countries, a developed North and a developing South, the model examines Northern firms employing researchers in the South in order to produce new varieties of a good. The Northern firms risk their product being imitated when offshoring research. Southern researchers may take information learned while employed by the Northern firm and start their own competing firm. The model's main predictions are supported empirically by a data set constructed with U.S. patent data. For high-tech industries, stronger IPR protection in the South increases both industry-level and firm-level offshoring at a rate faster than low-tech industries. Southern import tariffs do not affect firm-level innovative R&D offshoring.",2021,Business & Economics; International Relations,1

Incentives to promote the US pharmaceutical innovation: empirical research based on the case of Epogen,Incentives; pharmaceutical innovation; Epogen; empirical research; pharmaceutical industry; POLICY,"Objective This study aims at emphasizing the significant impact of the incentives to promote the United States (US) pharmaceutical innovation. Methods We carried out a retrospective single-case study. We analyzed the innovation process of Epogen: basic research, applied research, regulatory, and marketing. Results Incentives and policies of pharmaceutical innovation significantly facilitates the entire life cycle of Epogen. The transfer of patent presented by the Bayh-Dole Act allowed Amgen to purchase the research results of Epogen. Relying on the intellectual property mechanisms and financing incentives, Amgen raised the funds needed for Epogen in applied research. Special review shortened the regulatory of Epogen. Epogen obtained orphan drug designation twice and 8 years of market exclusivity. Tax deduction and research funding provided direct economic compensation. The patent system enabled Epogen to obtain 32 years of patent protection (1983-2015). Monopoly pricing was a significant determinant to increase the sales of Epogen through pricing strategies. Conclusion We pointed out that Amgen has developed the successful innovation of Epogen taking advantages of the incentives. Effective and flexible incentives and policies are essential to support the entire life cycle of new drugs, ultimately forming a sustainable driver for the long-run pharmaceutical innovation.",2021,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Patent as security in insolvency process: Problems and solutions,insolvency; key topics; patent; security; ,"There are various ways by which a company can raise funds. The easiest is through debt financing, that is creating debt securities. When a debt is created, a security equivalent to the debt amount is given by the debtor as collateral. The collateral can either be a tangible or intangible asset. Tangible assets are those which could be perceived by senses while intangibles include intellectual property rights of a company. Usually, the documents of IP rights are used to create security interest. The created IP sometimes will be again used to create a pledge, in that case, the question as to who will have the authority of the property is still not clarified in Indian laws.

Commons thought that prices should be stable and that the law of supply and demand should be controlled by the power of the state through patent law and by protecting bargaining equality. Commons also thought that prices should be stabilized by macro monetary policy. These means would allow the realization of a reasonable price. Commons called the objective and measurable value in money, which is determined by a court ruling, reasonable value. Analysis of Commons's price and business cycle theories point toward the realization of both reasonable price and reasonable value and toward reasonable capitalism that can replace banker capitalism.",2020,Business & Economics,1
"Global licences under threat of injunctions: FRAND commitments, competition law, and battles",Licences; Injunctions; FRAND; Jurisdiction; SEPs; Competition law; PATENT HOLDUP,"This article examines three, intertwined questions arising from the recent case law on global FRAND licences under threat of injunction. First, whether the obligation of an implementer to enter into a global licence of all the standard-essential patent (SEP) owner's relevant SEPs on pain of a national injunction is consistent with the policies underpinning a SEP owner's obligation to grant a FRAND licence. Secondly, whether the conduct of a SEP owner insisting on an implementer entering into a global licence under threat of an injunction is compatible with the UK Chapter II prohibition and Article 102 TFEU. Thirdly, whether the assumption and exercise by national courts of the power to settle the terms of global licences is a rational way of resolving global FRAND licensing disputes. On all three counts, the conclusion is that departing from territorial jurisdiction in the matter of FRAND licences is not advisable as it has the effect of distorting the incentives of SEP owners and implementers in such a way that FRAND licences and FRAND negotiations are less likely to reflect, or be driven by, the value of the underlying technology. As a result, global FRAND licences may apply excessive royalties or royalties for SEPs that are invalid, not essential, or not infringed. A system of national enforcement is better suited to striking a right balance between the interests of SEP owners and implementers, producing better outcomes in terms of effects on social welfare and productivity.",2023,Government & Law,1
Grafting Traditional Knowledge onto a Common Law System,; GENETIC-RESOURCES; PROPERTY; AUSTRALIA; BIOPIRACY; HERITAGE; CULTURE; PLANTS,"Modern legal systems are not usually designed to protect Indigenous traditional knowledge or traditional cultural expressions but are, more often, historically complicit in their misuse or suppression. The undefined status of traditional knowledge has left Indigenous communities vulnerable to harms not readily cognizable by either common or civil law systems: exploitation of those communities' genetic resources and medical knowledge, demeaning of their sacred symbols, and further alienation from their culture and land following colonial dispossession. Indigenous groups have therefore sought greater protection of traditional knowledge through a range of domestic and international legal avenues. This Article examines the experience of Australia as the common law jurisdiction that has likely gone furthest in protecting traditional knowledge. Aboriginal Australian claimants have found varying degrees of success through mechanisms such as copyright law, patent law, consumer protection, fiduciary claims, and privacy rights. Even at their most successful, however, these claimants have not obtained recognition of the unique interests represented by traditional knowledge. Instead, they have been forced to translate their claims into terms close to the conventional utilitarian or personality-based justifications for intellectual property. Australia therefore illustrates the potential of a common law system's ability to incrementally adapt to novel claims-but also that system's ultimate inadequacy.",2021,Government & Law,1

The Debauched Commons: A Dark Parable,Intellectual property rights; Agamben; Biopolitics; First nations peoples; Wadawurrung; Australia; ,"'The Debauched Commons: A Dark Parable' summarizes issues regarding intellectual property rights and immaterial culture through a nuanced reading of how First Nations Peoples worldwide have been forced by forms of neoliberal-capitalist exploitation of the knowledge commons to ring-fence and/or commodify their lived traditions, in many cases dating back 100,000 years and clearly predating any and all Western (First World) concepts of ownership. The intention of the structuralist-inspired reading of this enforced defensive position is to emphasize and clarify issues concerning prior art and moral rights, two of the most ambiguous and gamed elements of copyright and patent law. Drawing upon the international context of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) and the Convention for Safeguarding Intangible Heritage (2003), this essay will focus, in part, on the travails of Aboriginals in Australia as representative of First Peoples worldwide and their long-exploited and long-expropriated traditions, inclusive of land, but foremost lived knowledge, but also their often compromised position vis-a-vis various Australian state and Commonwealth legislation concerning recognition of their copyright, moral rights, and intellectual property rights. In this complex dance between tradition, heritage, and law, the so-called public domain often also becomes a de facto warehouse for the eventual conversion of intangible rights to collectively held and stored cultural property, which is then leveraged and/or converted to cultural capital by both public institutions and private companies. The primary premise of the analytic to be applied is that commodification of knowledge is more or less co-equal to the digitization of culture and the regimes of expropriation and/or outright theft associated with platform cultures. Platform culture, in turn, implicates otherwise benign, or apparently benign institutions (for example, academia and the art world) claiming to advance understanding and resolution of the twin nemeses of post-contemporary cultural politics-diversity and justice. The subtle machinations of what has come to be called the art-academic industrial complex will thus be analyzed for implicit and explicit practices that are reducible to the appropriation of native rites and rights, and laws and lores, for self-serving reasons inclusive of radical-chic posturing and politically correct tokenism.",2023,Government & Law; Linguistics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,1

In this study, we take advantage of regulatory changes in patent prosecution in the United States to provide plausibly causal evidence linking increases in coordination requirements with insourcing. Moreover, we examine the role of plural sourcing, that is, simultaneously making and buying, when responding to changes in coordination requirements. We find that the move toward insourcing is more pronounced for plural-sourcing firms as compared to firms relying on outsourcing. These results are consistent with the view that plural sourcing provides firms with flexibility to switch between sourcing modes when facing changing coordination requirements. Managerial Summary We study the sourcing of patent prosecution services in large innovative companies and show that in-house production is more beneficial when coordination requirements between inventors and attorneys increase. Importantly, we find that plural-sourcing firms, that is, firms that work with both internal attorneys and external law firms, are more likely to respond to these increases and move toward insourcing as compared to firms relying only on outsourcing. This suggests that plural sourcing can be regarded as a strategic investment in sourcing flexibility, allowing firms to respond to changing coordination requirements. This is an adaptive capability which is especially useful in knowledge-intensive sectors.",2022,Business & Economics,1

We find a positive association between innovation and nonsmoking laws enacted near companies' headquarters locations, particularly in earlier years when smoking rates were highest. We use multiple difference-in-differences specifications, matched samples, companies headquartered in contiguous counties across state lines, and falsification tests to establish the robustness of the observed association and reduce the likelihood of alternative explanations. We then use an inductive approach to explore multiple potential mechanisms behind this correlation. We find evidence suggestive of the following mechanisms: improved health; improvements to employee creativity, productivity, and absenteeism; and increases in the local employee pool. Other mechanisms likely exist, but the collective evidence suggests that policy-based efforts to improve health are associated with a positive externality-increased corporate innovation.",2023,Business & Economics,1

The short-acting antimicrobial sulfa drug sulfathiazole is known for its concomitant crystallization, which has five known polymorphs, due to conformational flexibility and hydrogen-bond synthon variation. In its development stage of a drug the issue of concomitant crystallization needs to be addressed with respect to patent litigation, including legal actions to protect patents against infringement. A functional self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of organic thiol on a gold surface has been employed as an efficient approach to control concomitant nucleation of such flexible drugs. The crystallization on a SAM surface is mostly kinetically driven and often leads to the nucleation of novel metastable forms. Spectroscopic, thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction studies reveal that a previously unknown, sixth form of the drug nucleates on the designed SAM surface.",2020,Chemistry,1
Can the water resources tax promote the water-saving innovation performance of high water consumption companies? -Empirical analysis from the pilot provinces in China,Water-saving innovation performance; Groundwater over-exploitation; Green authorized patent; Annual reports; Patent data; High water consumption companies; Water resources tax; GREEN INNOVATION; MODEL; GOVERNMENTS; POLICIES; GROWTH; LAW,"Water resource shortages and groundwater overexploitation in China restrict high-quality economic development and cause serious environmental issues. To promote the intensive use of water resources, suppress groundwater overexploitation and force high water consumption companies to save water, the Chinese government implemented interim measures for expanding the reform of the water resources tax in 2017. We represent water-saving innovation performance as the number of authorized green patents promoted by the water resources tax. By selecting the annual reports and patent data of 818 high water consumption listed companies and 727 nonhigh water consumption listed companies in pilot and nonpilot provinces, we use double difference and triple difference methods to verify the influence of the water resources tax policy on promoting the water-saving innovation performance of high water consumption companies in pilot provinces. Then, the parallel trend test, PSM-DDD robustness test and placebo test are used to demonstrate the rigor and effectiveness of this study, where all possible factors that interfere with the results of the study are excluded. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis shows that the water resource tax policy is more significant for promoting the watersaving innovation performance of nonstate-owned and small and medium-sized companies than it is for promoting that of state-owned and large-scale companies.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
How can sectoral green economic growth alter energy transformation?,Sectoral green growth; Energy transition progress; Non-renewables consumption; Green technological accessibility; ASEAN; Q56; O10; Q41; F55; ,"This study explores the relationship between sustainable economic growth in ASEAN's industrial and agricultural sectors and energy transformation (2005-2021). Using the Cross-Sectionally Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) approach, it uncovers the positive impact of green economic growth on reducing fossil fuel consumption. Discrepancies are influenced by sector size, technological accessibility, and strategy complexity. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development shows dual effects on consumption: an initial increase in the short term and a subsequent decrease in the long term. Conversely, the influence of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and patent applications is constrained by the absence of green patent mechanisms and economic intricacies. The poverty ratio acts as a diminishing factor, reflecting its impact on demand-supply dynamics.

The labor effects of R&D tax incentives: evidence from VC-backed startups,venture capital; entrepreneurship; R&D tax credits; payroll tax credits; skilled labor; startup scaling; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; INVESTMENT; SCIENTISTS; RIGHTS; POLICY; STATE,"We evaluate the impact of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015, which allowed some existing venture-capital-backed startups to monetize their research and development (R&D) tax credits against payroll taxes in the United States. We show that marginally eligible startups increase their demand for R&D workers more than marginally ineligible startups after the PATH Act's enactment. These effects are stronger among startups that are financially constrained. Marginally eligible startups subsequently recruit workers with more education and experience and file more patents with new inventors. Our findings suggest payroll tax credits are effective in scaling startups and stimulating R&D activities through skilled labor recruitment.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Organic impurity profiling of fentanyl samples associated with recent clandestine laboratory methods,clandestine laboratory; fentanyl; gas chromatography; mass spectrometry; GC; MS; illicit drugs; impurity profiling; synthesis; ALKYLATION,"Nearly a decade ago, fentanyl reappeared in the United States illicit drug market. In the years since, overdose deaths have continued to rise as well as the amount of fentanyl seized by law enforcement agencies. Research surrounding fentanyl production has been beneficial to regulatory actions and understanding illicit fentanyl production. In 2017, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began collecting seized fentanyl samples from throughout the United States to track purity, adulteration trends, and synthetic impurity profiles for intelligence purposes. The appearance of a specific organic impurity, phenethyl-4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (phenethyl-4-ANPP) indicates a shift in fentanyl production from the traditional Siegfried and Janssen routes to the Gupta-patent route. Through a collaboration between the DEA and the US Army's Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center (DEVCOM CBC), the synthesis of fentanyl was investigated via six synthetic routes, and the impurity profiles were compared to those of seized samples. The synthetic impurity phenethyl-4-ANPP was reliably observed in the Gupta-patent route published in 2013, and its structure was confirmed through isolation and structure elucidation. Organic impurity profiling results for illicit fentanyl samples seized in late 2021 have indicated yet another change in processing with the appearance of the impurity ethyl-4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (ethyl-4-ANPP). Through altering reagents traditionally used in the Gupta-patent route, the formation of this impurity was determined to occur through a modification of the route as originally described in the Gupta patent.",2023,Legal Medicine,1
Biosimilars in Belgium: a proposal for a more competitive market,Biosimilars; off-patent biologicals; competition; sustainability; Belgium; IBD,"More than ten years after the first biosimilars were authorized for use in the European Union, Belgium still experiences limited competition from biosimilars, as exemplified by low market shares. Achieving high biosimilar market shares is not necessarily a goal in itself, as cost savings are also realized by mandatory price reductions on originator medicines in Belgium. However, we believe that biosimilars play a role in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the off-patent biologicals market. It is therefore crucial to list what has been done and what is needed to support the Belgian government in establishing a policy framework for a competitive off-patent biologicals market. We provide a comprehensive overview of the Belgian biosimilar market, including existing hurdles for biosimilar use in Belgium. Based on these hurdles and supplemented with learnings from other European countries, we propose practical recommendations that can be implemented to overcome them. Several Belgian stakeholders had the opportunity to comment on these recommendations. Specifically, we suggest to evolve towards a long-term consistent, integrated policy framework via i) the creation of a proactive and transparent climate supporting a level playing field for both biosimilar and reference product, including public dissemination of how savings at the level of the Belgian healthcare system are used, ii) investment in educational activities, including raising awareness of societal responsibility, iii) enforcement of the practical implementation of public procurement law, and iv) the development of incentives for physicians, who are key stakeholders in the Belgian off-patent biologicals market.",2021,General & Internal Medicine,1
Technology Emergence as a Structuring Process: A Complexity Theory Perspective on Blockchain,technology emergence; blockchain; complexity theory; structuring; innovation; patents; LOCAL SEARCH; INNOVATION; DYNAMICS; COLLABORATION; SCIENCE; DISCONTINUITIES; PERFORMANCE; HIERARCHIES; ADAPTATION; SPECIATION,"Drawing on complexity theory, we investigate the structuring processes and underlying mechanisms underpinning the emergence of a new technology. Empirically, we track the emergence of blockchain technology by examining international patents issued between 2009 and 2020. Our results indicate that technology emergence follows an evolutionary trajectory that progresses from disordered to structured interactions among the technological elements, culminating in the formation of a technological core that acts as a pole of attraction for further interactions and delineates boundaries within the technological domain. Technology structuring is fueled by what we term technology fitness and self-reinforcing mechanisms that progressively transform primitive structures into more complex, self-organized configurations. Our study offers a novel framework of technology emergence, highlighting how dispersed bits of technological knowledge gradually aggregate into complex structures that define the specific trajectory of a particular domain.",2024,Business & Economics; Psychology,1
Unveiling the intrinsic interactions of science and technology in the fuzzy domain: A visual and quantitative analysis,The fuzzy domain; Science -technology interaction; Machine learning algorithms; Network analysis; PATENT CITATIONS; BIBLIOMETRICS; PUBLICATIONS; DECADES; LINKAGE,"The progression of the fuzzy domain is propelled synergistically by the evolution of science via academic papers and the advancement of technology through technical patents. However, the intrinsic interrelationships within the science and technology (S&T) interactive landscape of this domain remain largely unknown, as few studies attempt to explore these close interrelationships. To bridge this research gap, based on 161,060 academic publications and 36,693 granted patents, we measured their mutual attribution between S&T from the perspective of textual semantics and structure information on top of a quantitative network monitoring process. The results showed that the fuzzy domain lacked technology-oriented topics in terms of semantic relations and presented an interactive pattern where science was ahead of technology; that is, science worked as an engineer to expand the knowledge boundaries of the research field, and technology existed more as a beneficiary. This article presents cutting-edge insights into the intrinsic S&T interactions of the fuzzy domain in a visual and quantitative approach for the first time and aims to aid researchers in theoretically grasping the S&T innovation laws.",2024,Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,1

The predictive model for future trends is based on the evolutionary model of the TRIZ theory, with particular attention to the evolutionary law, from macro to micro, which explains how technical systems evolve towards increasingly smaller, controlled, and resource-efficient interactions. In our case, we applied the focus to the interface between the heat source and the pyrolyzed raw material. The proposed evolutionary model showed a substantial alignment with chronological trends, and the model was consistent with both patent trends and those of the scientific literature. To make the analysis quantitatively more robust, a comparison of the different technologies has also been introduced in terms of percentage distribution and the number of patents/papers referring to the different classes of heating rates and reaction temperatures and types of flash/fast/intermediate/slow reaction. Finally, a quantitative metric based on the innovation index has been adopted, to take into account the number of citations normalized on the years of publication. The main outputs of this study identified that radiations-based pyrolysis, involving microscopic interaction, seem more interesting in term of technical performances (i.e. heating rate and reaction temperature), although their technological growth has yet to occur, unlike fluidized bed and hot balls, which typically work at a macroscopic level and seem to have already reached maturity. According to a bibliometric index, laser corpus resulted three time more innovative then fluidized bed reactors papers, especially for heating rates and reactions temperature.",2021,Chemistry; Energy & Fuels; Engineering,1
Analysis of medication rules and application characteristics of Chinese patent medicine containing borneol based on data mining,Borneol; Internal prescriptions; External prescriptions; Primary diseases; Proprietary Chinese medicines; Medication rules; ,"Background: In this study, the regularity of drug containing borneol proprietary Chinese medicine was mined, to provide reference for the clinical application and new drug research and development of borneol.Methods: The database of proprietary Chinese medicines on Pharmaceutical Intelligence Network was searched for internal and external prescriptions that contained borneols and the diseases they treat. Microsoft Office Excel 2019 and SPSS Modeler 18.0 were used to analyze the properties, flavors, meridians tropisms and association rule analysis of the medicines, and Origin 21.0 software was used to draw the association rules diagram.Results: Among them, 528 prescriptions of internal Chinese patent medicine containing borneol and 387 prescriptions of external Chinese patent medicine were included. The diseases treated by internal prescription were mainly neurological diseases and heart diseases, among which Chinese medicines with higher frequency of compatibility with borneol were bezoar, licorice, cinnabar, musk and scutellaria. The diseases treated by external prescription were mainly physical disabilities, paralysis diseases, sore and ulcer diseases and so on. Among them, menthol, camphor, frankincense, angelica, and carthami flos and so on are the most frequently combined with borneol.Conclusion: The prescription of Chinese patent medicine containing borneol is composed of cold or warm, pungent or bitter Chinese medicine. Internal prescription primarily targets the meridians of the heart, liver, and lungs, and is often combined with sedative, antipyretic and detoxicating drugs to treat stroke, infantile convulsion and angina pectoris. External prescription mainly acts on liver, heart and spleen meridian, and is often combined with drugs for clearing heat, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis to treat rheumatic arthralgia syndrome and sore and ulcer diseases.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Off-Patent Biologicals and Biosimilars Tendering in Europe-A Proposal towards More Sustainable Practices,tender; procurement; off-patent; biological; biosimilar; award criteria; switching; interchangeability; sustainability; competition; ,"Background: In Europe, off-patent biologicals and biosimilars are largely procured by means of tender procedures. The organization and design of tenders may play a key role in the evolving biosimilar market, and currently, it is not fully elucidated how tenders for off-patent biologicals and biosimilars are designed and if approaches are aligned with sustaining market competition and societal savings for healthcare systems over the long term. This study aims to (i) explore the design and implementation of tender procedures for off-patent biologicals and biosimilars in Europe, (ii) identify learnings for sustainable tender approaches from purchasers and suppliers, and (iii) formulate recommendations in support of competitive and sustainable tender practices in the off-patent biologicals market. Methods: A mixed methods design was applied. A quantitative web-survey was conducted with hospital pharmacists and purchasers (N = 60, of which 47 completed the survey in full), and qualitative expert-interviews with purchasers and suppliers (N = 28) were carried out. Results: The web survey results showed that the organization and design of tenders for off-patent biologicals and biosimilars, and the experience of hospital pharmacists and purchasers with this, considerably varies on several elements across European countries. From the qualitative interviews, signals emerged across the board that some of the current tender approaches might negatively affect market dynamics for off-patent biologicals and biosimilars. The focus on generating short-term savings and existence of originator favouring tender practices were identified as elements that may limit timely competition from and market opportunity for biosimilar suppliers. The need to optimize tender processes, considering a more long-term strategic and sustainable view, was expressed. In addition, challenges appear to exist with differentiating between products beyond price, showing the need and opportunity to guide stakeholders with the (appropriate) inclusion of award criteria beyond price. Due to the variety in tender organization in Europe, a 'one size fits all' tendering framework is not possible. However, on an overarching level, it was argued that tender procedures must aim to (i) ensure market plurality and (ii) include award criteria beyond price (warranted that criteria are objectively and transparently defined, scored and competitively rewarded). Depending on the market (maturity), additional actions may be needed. Conclusions: Findings suggest the need to adjust tender procedures for off-patent biologicals and biosimilars, considering a more long-term strategic and market sustainable view. Five main avenues for optimization were identified: (i) safeguarding a transparent, equal opportunity setting for all suppliers with an appropriate use of award criteria; (ii) fostering a timely opening of tender procedures, ensuring on-set competition; (iii) ensuring and stimulating adherence to laws on public procurement; (iv) securing an efficient process, improving plannability and ensuring timely product supply and (v) safeguarding long-term sustainable competition by stimulating market plurality.",2021,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Sovereignty for Sale? Tribal Patent Shelters and the Risky Business of Sovereign Derivatives,; MONEY,"Sovereign tribal nations frequently conduct business with public and private entities. These transactions include routine transfers of goods and services, as well as more creative extraction technologies that locate revenue streams within tribal communities in desperate need of economic resources. One form of creative extraction involves tribal patent shelters. With this unique and emerging business partnership, nontribal corporations compensate an American Indian tribal nation for temporarily sheltering intellectual property from federal review using their sovereign immunity. These shelters demonstrate how the opportunities and challenges of tribal economic development are shifting in the current era of accelerated financialization. Using a set of court and legislative documents involving a patent partnership between the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and Allergan, a global pharmaceutical corporation, this article examines how the law has addressed these shifts and their expanding intersections between tribal sovereignty and commerce. Analyses show that the market value of sovereign immunity to protect the profits of intellectual property derives from a tribe's sovereignty and, when mobilized in this way, this valuation threatens to contract tribal sovereignty while expanding opportunities to increase corporate capital. Attention to this subtle but striking form of predation is key to preserving the future of tribal sovereignty and reflecting on the appeal these transactions have for economically depressed communities considering similar financial arrangements.",2022,Ethnic Studies,1

Employing the staggered adoption of data breach disclosure laws across various US states, we show that mandatory disclosure exacerbates CEOs' real earnings manipulation through production and operation management, which is more pronounced for firms of which the outbreak of data breaches is more of a concern and under stronger short-term market pressure. The law adoption is associated with higher stock price crash risk and fewer patenting activities.

Still, little is known about the central individual in this context: the CVC unit head, who acts as a knowledge broker between portfolio ventures and the parent organization. We combine human capital theory with the attention-based view to investigate the effects of various facets of CVC unit heads' experience on parent firms' innovative inputs in the form of explorative and exploitative patenting and innovative outputs, specifically market and technological breakthrough innovation. Drawing on a dataset of U.S.-listed firms with CVC units, our findings contribute to the CVC literature in three ways. First, we introduce CVC unit heads' career experiences as new individual-level antecedents of parent firms' innovative performance. Second, we enhance the understanding of the CVC-core paradox, which is the tension between exploration and exploitation in the parent firm. Finally, by employing a combination of patents and new product introductions as metrics for innovative performance, we bridge the gap between learning and innovation in extant CVC research, demonstrating that the effects of CVC unit heads include customer-facing outcomes.",2024,Business & Economics,1

However, research has mainly focused on the early stages of the innovation process, such as R&D and patenting. This study examines the role of EPLs in the later stages of the innovation process: the commercialization of new products. In particular, we focus on EPLs' relationship with two different new product commercialization outcomes: the launch and subsequent sales of new products. Using data on small European firms, we find that, controlling for invention, stricter EPLs are negatively associated with firms' likelihood of launching new products, but positively associated with the sales from new products. We discuss the implications of our results for theory and practice.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Is your search query well-formed? A natural query understanding for patent prior art search,Prior art search; Patent analysis; Deep learning; Bert-for-patents; PQAI; ,"Recent advances in Deep Learning based prior art search has enabled the development of easy -to -use prior art search engines that accept natural language search queries and provide improved search performance. However, unlike conventional keyword -based techniques where the results are readily interpreted by the presence of queried keywords, Deep Learning based techniques act like a black box. As a result, it is difficult for users to articulate their information in order to obtain optimal results. In this paper, we share insights on query well-formedness from extensive experimentation with PQAI,1 an open source Deep Learning based prior art search engine. We study the effects of various query parameters such as grammar, specificity, and verbosity on the search results and show that ill -formed queries containing grammatical errors, non -essential content, and broad terminology adversely affect the relevance of search results. We also develop a number of Machine Learning models, viz. Grammatical Error Detection Model (GEDM), Query Specificity Model (QSM), and Query Verbosity Model (QVM), to identify and mitigate commonly encountered issues with ill -formed queries. The data, survey forms, and code relating to this work will be released to the community2.

It turns out that there are few certainties in this area. Instead, there is a bewildering array of standards for assessing the consequences of agreements on the relevant market. Time and again, it is unclear how 'abstract' or 'concrete' the assessment has to be. Not much more clarity comes from the recent judgments in Generics, Lundbeck, and Budapest Bank on patent settlement agreements and price fixing, respectively. Nevertheless, they contain the elements of a simple and comprehensive test that dispenses with the complications that have built up in the case law.",2023,Government & Law,1
Recent Advancements and Patent Search on Polymeric Nanoparticles,Polymeric nanoparticles; Patent search; Targeted medication delivery; Generation of nanotechnology; Safe-by-design; DELIVERY; CHALLENGES; RELEASE; DESIGN,"Nanosized particles have enticing properties that have received significant attention in recent decades. Polymeric nanoparticles (PNs) are particulates ranging from 1 to 1000 nm that can be loaded with active chemicals that are either entrapped within or surface-adsorbed onto the polymeric core. The term nanoparticle refers to both nanocapsules and nanospheres, which differ in morphological aspect. Polymeric nanoparticles have shown technological breakthroughs in the detection and management of many diseases. This review provides an overview of polymers used in PNs for the treatment of cancer and ocular diseases. PNs used for the treatment of different types of cancer and ocular disorders are listed with recent patents. This review also focuses on technological advancements with special reference to the safe-by-design concept. From the literature survey, it was observed that PNs can be used as nanocarriers for the effective delivery of nanomedicines to cancer cells and improve ocular drug delivery. PNs act by increasing solubility, controlling pharmacokinetics, extending release, reducing side effects, and achieving a therapeutic effect with a reduced dose. PNs have shown promising potential in targeting anticancer agents to specific tumor cells by active targeting.

To do that, we rely on data from a recent survey conducted by the Brazilian Innovation and Technology Transfer Managers National Forum (FORTEC Innovation Survey). Employing negative binomial models, we find that the quality of technology-transfer-related regulations has a positive impact on both patenting and licensing activities, whereas the mere existence of those regulations has no (or only little) effect on technology transfer outcomes. This suggests that the presence of regulations per se may not provide (i) the incentive necessary to outweighing the opportunity costs and motivate academics to engage in technology transfer; and/or (ii) the necessary level of clarity, flexibility and consistency to mitigate uncertainties and transaction costs for both firms and university inventors. We also find a negative relationship between regional economic development and patenting outcomes. In contrast, we determine that universities located in regions with higher levels of economic and innovative activity generate more licensing agreements. Finally, our results suggest that the marginal effects of the quality of both IP protection and licensing regulations are higher in more developed regions.",2020,Business & Economics; Public Administration,1
"Abusive copyright litigation, proposed solutions, and the implications for Creative Commons licenses",Copyright; Abusive litigation; Creative Commons; Open licenses; US copyright law; Statutory damages; Troll; ,"US Copyright Law empowers rights holders to enforce their rights and to defend the market value of their intellectual property through litigation. So-called copyright trolls are rights holders who exploit the law and the court system by pursuing allegations of infringement primarily to generate revenue through court-awarded statutory damages or settlements outside of court. Such abusive litigation undermines the intention of the US Constitution's Patent and Copyright Clause as well as the public's respect for copyright. Yet legislative reform intended to deter abuse may impact those offering their work under Creative Commons (CC) licenses when they seek to enforce their rights.

Ties that bind: Ethnic inventors in multinational enterprises' knowledge integration and exploitation,Migration; Inventors; Multinational enterprises; Knowledge integration; Knowledge exploitation; Ethnic ties; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PATENT CITATIONS; BRAIN-DRAIN; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; INNOVATION; FIRM; US; SPILLOVERS,"Geographically dispersed reservoirs of knowledge represent significant opportunities for multinational enterprises (MNEs), both in terms of feeding the firm's innovation process, as well as adapting technology to new markets. They face serious challenges in accomplishing these tasks, due to the well-known barriers associated with the transfer of knowledge out of its local context. We argue that ethnic inventors might play a role in alleviating these challenges, by acting as a bridge between their countries of origin (CoO) and the MNE headquarters. Using USPTO data on internationally connected patents granted to US-based MNEs operating in knowledge-intensive industries over the period 1975-2009, our empirical exercise shows that patents involving ethnic inventors from a given CoO are associated with greater integration of knowledge originating from that CoO in the MNE innovation process. Further investigation indicates that this effect is probably limited to knowledge developed within the MNE's network, suggesting that ethnic ties - per se - might not be sufficiently powerful to overcome the joint barriers of national borders and organizational boundaries. Finally, our analysis reveals that ethnic inventors may also be associated with knowledge exploitation in their CoO. This mainly seems to occur in CoOs plagued by market-related institutional voids.",2020,Business & Economics,1
Cross-Instance Regulatory Compliance Checking of Business Process Event Logs,Business; Runtime; Regulation; Monitoring; Computational modeling; Computational complexity; Patents; Business process; event log; compliance; regulations; cross-instance; instance-spanning; runtime verification; EFFICIENT; VERIFICATION,"Event logs capture the execution of business processes, such that each task is represented by an event and each individual execution is a chronological sequence of events, called an event trace. Event logs allow after-the-act and runtime analysis of deployed business processes to verify whether their execution complies with regulations and business requirements. Checking the compliance of a single sequence of events in a trace is straightforward and a number of approaches have been proposed to address this. However, some regulations or business rules span multiple process instances, requiring a cross-instance analysis. In order to check whether such requirements are maintained at all times, multiple traces need to be analysed together, which can result in a combinatorial computational complexity. In this article, we present a novel approach that efficiently checks runtime regulatory compliance based on event logs, while supporting cross-instance rule evaluation and extensible function evaluation over sequences of attribute data values. The efficiency and applicability of the proposed method is tested in a two-pronged evaluation, showing a significant improvement over existing techniques with respect to capabilities as well as computational complexity. The approach presented in this paper is subject to a patent application, with patent number WO2021/248201.",2023,Computer Science; Engineering,1
How do intercultural proximity and social fragmentation promote international patent cooperation?,Innovation; Culture; Gravity model; Trust; Acceptance and tolerance; L26; O30; Z10; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION PERFORMANCE; GRAVITY MODEL; DIVERSITY; RELIGION; TECHNOLOGY; LANGUAGE; CULTURE; TRUST,"Joint innovation across countries plays a vital role in international networks of knowledge-intensive businesses. We study how the cultural backgrounds of collaborators influence success in international innovation. Intercultural proximity implies shared values and norms that can engender trust and cooperation in innovation. However, social fragmentation can induce conflict and mistrust, whereas joint innovation can progress through the tolerance and acceptance of different views. Our gravity model analysis of international patent cooperation data shows that social fragmentation complements intercultural proximity along the social identity dimensions of religion, ethnicity, and language to promote joint innovation. Intercultural proximity operates through trust, especially for countries with weak intellectual property rights laws, while social fragmentation operates through tolerance and acceptance, especially for countries with strong IPR laws. Economic strength, trade, and institutional differences are also important predictors of collaborative innovation. We confirm that geographical distance between countries lowers cooperation, but it cannot explain away the positive effects of intercultural proximity and social fragmentation. Co-innovation increases with intercultural proximity - and even more so when countries are socially fragmented. International joint innovation allows knowledge-intensive businesses to synergistically draw upon the ideas, expertise, and experience of innovators from their respective cultures (countries). However, such collaborations are often hampered by the uncertainty of partner exploitation and free-riding especially in the absence of formal institutions such as strong intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. In such cases, while intercultural proximity (e.g., along the dimensions of religion, ethnicity, and language) can promote cooperation through the informal institution of trust, social fragmentation can induce mistrust and in turn hamper collaboration. This is puzzling in light of evidence that fragmentation also promotes innovation. Thus, we empirically show that the positive effect of intercultural proximity operates through trust especially when IPR protection is weak. The positive effect of fragmentation on international patent cooperation operates through tolerance and acceptance especially when IPR protection is strong. This implies that nurturing tolerance and acceptance while strengthening IPR and developing the intellectual property ecosystem in fragmented societies, building intercultural trust, and increasing diversity in countries, alliances, or firms can promote co-patenting success.",2024,Business & Economics,1
The U-shaped impact of export quality on firms' innovation output: Empirical evidence from China,; ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; PRODUCT INNOVATION; CHANGING WORLDS; VALUE CHAIN; MANAGEMENT; ADOPTION; CONVENTIONS; MARKET; COMPETITION; GOVERNANCE,"Ensuring product quality plays a pivotal role in the successful execution of new product development and serves as a cornerstone for fostering innovation within enterprises. In this study, we investigate the impact of export quality at the firm level on innovation outcomes, utilizing data from Chinese publicly listed companies and customs data spanning the period from 2010 to 2015. Our analysis uncovers a notable U-shaped relationship between export quality and innovation output in Chinese manufacturing enterprises, particularly with respect to invention patents and utility model patents. Subsequent exploration of heterogeneity reveals that this U-shaped relationship is consistent for non-state-owned enterprises, firms operating in high-technology sectors, young firms, firms exporting to high-income countries, firms situated in the eastern region, and firms engaged in processing trade. Additionally, we find a positively significant effect of Chinese manufacturing export quality on the innovation output of firms exclusively involved in general trade. This paper's key contribution lies in identifying the U-shaped influence of export quality on firms' innovation output and its applicability. The findings suggest that Chinese manufacturing enterprises need to improve the quality of their export products on a long-term and sustained basis. A series of quality standards for the dynamic development of different industries should be formulated, and actively safeguard the innovation needs of these enterprises, thereby enhancing the value chain position of Chinese manufacturing enterprises.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Can directors' liability reduction promote corporate innovation?,Corporate innovation; Director liability reduction; Korean market; INCENTIVES; OWNERSHIP,"Purpose This study aims to explore the effects of director liability reduction (DLR) laws on corporate innovation strategies in South Korea. Design/methodology/approach Regression analysis is used to investigate the effects of the directors' liability reduction coverage on the corporate innovation. The data includes 7,517 firm-year observations spanning from 2011 to 2017. Findings The authors provide empirical evidence that directors feel protected by the coverage and are able to focus more on innovative projects. Using research and development expenditure and the number of patents registered to measure the firm's innovation, we find that covered firms spend more on R&D and register more patents than non-covered firms.

The research on the evolution characteristics of its cooperative network is beneficial to the research on the mechanism of improving the innovation capability of the industry. Based on the cooperative invention patent application data in 2002-2020, using the social network analysis method and Gephi 0.9.2 visualization to construct a patent cooperation network and knowledge network, this paper analyzes the overall characteristics and evolution law of the patent cooperation network in the advanced nonferrous metal industry. It is found that, first, the structure of the innovation network in China's advanced nonferrous metals industry is becoming more and more complex. The scale of the cooperation network and knowledge network is increasing, and the small world is obvious. Second, some innovation subjects, as key nodes, play the role of bridge and grasp the general direction of technology. The structure of the key nodes in the network has changed, and the cooperative innovation network of industry-university-research has gradually evolved from enterprise-led to university-led. Third, the number of technical categories has increased and the depth of technology has been enhanced in China's advanced nonferrous metal field.

The other view is that the Antitrust Law inhibits innovation by monopolistic firms and fosters rent-seeking, which is bad for economic growth. To provide a possible perspective for clarifying the controversy, this paper aims to answer the following two questions: first, will the Antitrust Law inhibit corporate innovation? Second, does the antitrust enforcement agency discriminate against private enterprises? Design/methodology/approach Based on the samples of A-share listed companies from 2003 to 2013, the authors use the implementation of China's Antitrust Law in 2008 as a policy shock, take the monopoly enterprises in each industry as the treatment group and competitive enterprises as the control group, using the difference-in-differences method to test the impact of the implementation of the Antitrust Law on corporate innovation activities. Findings The results show that compared with competitive enterprises, the patent output of monopolistic enterprises was significantly reduced after the implementation of the Antitrust Law, which indicates that the Antitrust Law does inhibit the innovation activities of monopolistic enterprises. Further research finds that the innovation suppression effect of the Antitrust Law is more prominent in state-owned enterprises, which means that the government does not have selective law enforcement against private enterprises in the process of law enforcement. Therefore, the results provide evidence for the idea that government intervention is neutral. Originality/value First, the paper enriches and expands the research on the factors affecting corporate innovation from the perspective of market structure. Second, it enriches and expands relevant research on the consequences of implementing the Antitrust Law from the perspective of corporate innovation. Third, it not only provides the relevant empirical evidence for clarifying the dispute about the Antitrust Law but also is helpful to clarify whether the Chinese Government has selective law enforcement against private enterprises.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Interaction between English and Irish as a Factor of Irish Migration in 14th-15th Centuries,Irish migration in the Middle Ages; interaction between the Irish and English; Irish colony; Anglicization; IRELAND,"Based on the analysis of the acts of the Irish Parliament, patent lists and charters of the English king, as well as petitions, the author identifies the main directions of interaction between the English and the Irish in the 14th 15th centuries, and examines the privileges of coastal towns in southern Ireland. Factors of migration are established. Attention is paid to the connections between landlords, established through client-patronage relationships and land grants. The relevance of the topic is due to the underestimation in historiography of the degree of connections between England and Ireland, which were a determining factor in choosing the country for migration, as well as the lack of works on the specific problem. Source analysis demonstrated that interaction was established not only in the sphere of trade and law, but also at a cultural and everyday level. The author concludes that the active development of trade in the Irish Sea, the spread of English legislation and language, helped the Irish adapt more quickly in coastal towns in England. The emigration of Irish people from four counties to England, in turn, stimulated internal migration of native Irish to Dublin, Meath, Louth, and Kildare.",2023,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,1
The interplay between antitrust law and intellectual property: stages of the European evolution,IPRs; antitrust; power of disposal of IPRs'; essential facilities doctrine; IPR entitlement and misuse thereof; strategic patenting; ,"The interplay is reconstructed in an evolutionary perspective along three main stages. In the first one, Commission focused on IPRs holders' power of disposition in order to prevent that profiting from the statutory 'territorial scope' of national exclusive rights, agreements were enacted partitioning the European market thus frustrating the goal of the Single Market. In the second phase, in order to avoid monopolization of top-level innovation, the statutory excludent power itself of holders of patents and copyrights on non-workably substitutable (thus 'essential') innovative solutions-and also holders of a dominant position-was tempered by a duty to grant access, on FRAND terms, to competitors willing licensees. In the third stage, in order to clear the market from 'unworthy' IPRs, thus ensuring a fairly competitive playing field, the attention focused on the acquisition itself of IPR entitlement and various forms of its anticompetitive misuse.",2023,Government & Law,1
Technological improvement rates and recent innovation trajectories in automated advanced composites manufacturing technologies: A patent-based analysis,Composite manufacturing technologies; Technological change; Technology trajectories; Performance improvement rates; FUNCTIONAL-APPROACH; MOORES LAW; SCIENCE; EXTENSION; PROGRESS; TRENDS,"The importance of advanced composites in industries such as aerospace, defense, automotive, clean energy, and hydrogen has grown at a fast pace and is expected to keep enlarging its strategic importance. Using objective patent-based methodologies, this paper estimates the yearly performance improvement rates and traces the most recent technological trajectories of Automated Tape Laying (ATL), Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) and Additive Manufacturing (AM) for advanced composites. For each technology, a set of representative patents is retrieved. A robust predictor based on the centrality of patents within the citation network is used to estimate yearly performance improvement rates. A knowledge persistence algorithm is applied to trace the most important technological trajectories. Results show that ATL (13.0%) and AFP (9.3%) are improving faster than milling technology (3.4%), a high grade metal technology, which indicates that composites applications should continue to grow relative to metal based components. AM for advanced composites is improving at a substantially faster rate (31.5%) suggesting potential to penetrate further as a viable solution in the advanced manufacturing landscape. ATL and AFP trajectories show developments mainly targeted to increase process productivity and reliability. Productivity increases are fostered primarily by innovations in automatic inspection, tow/tape heating, and material dispensing. Improvements over tow/tape cutting and steering systems and closed-loop control of operations contribute to reliability increase. AM appears to be evolving from cartesian motion to robotic arms machines. These allow for deposition over three dimensional paths which greatly increase component design freedom and mechanical properties further fostering AM's penetration.",2022,Engineering; Materials Science,1
Government's awareness of Environmental protection and corporate green innovation: A natural experiment from the new environmental protection law in China,Environmental protection regulation; Green innovation; Information disclosure; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PORTER HYPOTHESIS; INVESTMENT EVIDENCE; RISK EVIDENCE; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITIVENESS; DISCLOSURE; INCENTIVES; EMISSIONS,"Based on the impact of the new environmental protection law promulgated by the Chinese government in 2015, we employ the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to investigate the impact of government environmental regulation on corporate green innovation. The evidence shows that government environmental regulation can significantly increase the number of green patents of heavily polluting industries. This result holds after a series of robustness tests. The analysis of the economic mechanism indicates that the new environmental protection law brings supervision pressure to heavily polluting firms, prompting them to improve the quality of information disclosure, thus improving green innovation. In addition, the regional economic development level, government subsidies, and public supervision can significantly affect the positive impact of the new environmental protection law. Meanwhile, the effect is more prominent in non-stateowned enterprises and in firms with small scale, low profitability, and weak internal governance.

Just Sharing: The Virtues of Digital Sequence Information Benefit-Sharing for the Common Good,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; GENETIC-RESOURCES; NAGOYA PROTOCOL; OPPORTUNITIES; DISCOVERY; PATHWAY; ACID; LAW,"Genome sequence information is being used to develop improvements in diverse product areas from agriculture to therapeutics. In fact, the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines required access to the genome sequence of the virus. Beyond the COVID-19 context, however, vast amounts of what is being called digital sequence information (DSI) are being used and patented, without permission from the countries that own the genetic resources from which the sequences are derived. This issue is stymieing negotiations in several international fora, including the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Nagoya Protocol. These treaties obligate users of genetic resources to share the benefits of resource utilization with the resource providers. But parties disagree profoundly on whether these obligations extend to DSI. And as DSI often obviates the need for access to tangible material, monetary benefits are likely to decline even further. This Article identifies challenges to and opportunities for achieving just sharing outcomes on DSI under the CBD and Nagoya Protocol and argues for the development of a global multilateral benefit -sharing mechanism as a more just and efficient vehicle for compliance with benefit -sharing obligations while retaining open access to sequence information. The prime benefit -sharing beneficiaries are intended to be the indigenous peoples and local communities who conserve and safeguard global biodiversity, yet who often are the most socioeconomically deprived among us. As such, this Article also situates the DSI benefit -sharing controversy within the larger societal moments focused on justice for the vulnerable and climate change mitigation.  When we're not hungry for justice, it's usually because we're too full with privilege. ",2022,Government & Law,1
The evolution of intellectual property rights in metaverse based Industry 4.0 paradigms,Metaverse; Intellectual property; Copyrights; Patents; Trademarks; Business; EXPERIENCE,"Inventive property rights (IPR) issues became very important after the announcement of the metaverse. As in the metaverse, the traditional laws of IPR are applicable, and research on new laws that are dedicated to the metaverse has started. In this research paper, we analyze development in this area. We use the Scopus database to examine how metaverse entrepreneurship and IPR rights have evolved over time. We used different parameters such as collaboration index, citation analysis, and keyword co-occurrences to measure the growth in the respective area.

Secrecy by Default: How Regional Trade Agreements Reshape Protection of Source Code,; FORCED TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; WTO LAW; US; CHINA; ECONOMICS; AUTONOMY; POLICY,"A growing number of regional trade agreements include articles prohibiting access to or the transfer of source code as a condition of the import, distribution, sale, or use of software. We challenge this new approach to protecting source code in international economic law. Using Katharina Pistor's theory of the 'code of capital', we find that this approach protects source code as capital at the expense of the regulatory power of states. The new approach differs from existing ways of protecting source code as well as from the protection based on copyrights, patents, trade secrecy, and provisions on forced technology transfer. We show that it establishes the secrecy of source code by default and leaves only a small window for states to require access to source code.",2022,Government & Law,1
Redesigning Copyright Protection in the Era of Artificial Intelligence,; RIGHTS,"How to protect the creations of artificial intelligence (AI) systems through copyright law is one of the most significant and complex legal issues of our time. Debated by stakeholders around the world, the issue has so far evaded consensus. However, a series of administrative and judicial rulings has altered the landscape. In 2019, a Chinese district court affirmed the copyrightability of a news article written by an AI-powered robot, clarifying that it was the AI developer that should be deemed copyright owner of the news article. In 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, and the United Kingdom High Court prominently denied patent applications designating an AI system as an inventor. This Article reveals the profound implications of these recent AI rulings for copyright protection of AI-generated works. It examines how these rulings shed new light on the nature and scope of authorship and ownership, two legal issues that are central to deciding whether and how AI-generated works merit copyright protection. Drawing on its in-depth study of the recent AI rulings, the Article proposes a broad-based, forward-looking approach to protecting AI-generated works through a two-tiered legal mechanism. It suggests that legislators may consider awarding sui generis rights to AI works generated with human contributions, while those generated autonomously by AI systems without such contributions should be placed in the public domain without copyright protection.",2022,Government & Law,1
Spatial and historical drivers of fake news diffusion: Evidence from anti-Muslim discrimination in India,Discrimination; Fake news; Religion; Covid; India; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; PATENT CITATIONS; GEOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; INSTITUTIONS; INFORMATION; VIOLENCE; TWITTER; LEGACY; RADIO,"What drives the propagation of discriminatory fake news? To answer this question, this paper focuses on India at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic: on March 30, a Muslim convention (the Tablighi Jamaat ) in New Delhi became publicly recognized as a COVID hotspot. Using Twitter data, we build a comprehensive novel dataset of georeferenced tweets to identify anti -Muslim fake news. First, we document that fake news about Muslims intentionally spreading the virus spiked after March 30. Then, we investigate the geographical and historical determinants of the spread of fake news in a difference-in-difference setting. We find that the diffusion of anti -Muslim false stories was more pronounced (i) in districts closer to New Delhi, suggesting that fake news spread spatially; and (ii) in districts exposed to historical attacks by Muslim groups, suggesting that the propensity to disseminate fake news has deep-rooted historical origins.",2024,Business & Economics; Urban Studies,1
Patent law and 3D printing applications in response to COVID-19: Exceptions to inventor rights,3D printing; Art. 30 exceptions; COVID-19; medical equipment; patent rights; right to repair; ,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology offers promise in relation to much-needed health technologies associated with COVID-19. Additive manufacturing, which allows the rapid conversion of information from digital 3D models into physical objects, is uniquely well-positioned to address the shortage of critical medical devices by enabling the fabrication and repair of medical devices in a timely and cost-effective manner. This paper examines the issue of patent rights being at odds with access to critical 3D printable health technologies during COVID-19 crisis. It undertakes an in-depth analysis of the right to repair and calls for a clearer recognition of the right to repair exemption at the global level. It also evaluates the private and noncommercial use exception and proposes the use of a reasonably broad form of this exception to make it practically significant. It also considers the experimental use exception and calls upon World Trade Organization Member States to provide legislative clarity that a defense of an experimental use extends to repairs. This study is crucial because access to necessary health technologies, in a pandemic context, is a matter of life and death for millions of patients around the globe, especially for underprivileged patients in resource-constrained countries.",2022,Government & Law,1
Seller liability versus platform liability: optimal liability rule and law enforcement in the platform economy,Infringement of intellectual property right; Joint and several liability; Liability rule; Property rule; Platform liability; Seller liability; Trademark; K13; PRIVATE; DAMAGES,"In this paper, we examine whether the platform as well as the sellers violating the intellectual property right (IPR) should be liable. We first show that platform liability is socially better if the number of potential victims is very large. This is mainly due to the general enforcement effect of the platform's monitoring activity. In the case of specific enforcement in which each patent or trademark holder selling legitimate products tries to detect only the IP violations of its own brand, the monitoring activity of each seller has no spill-over effect, so that the deterrence effect of its monitoring activity remains the same regardless of the number of patent holders. However, in the case of general enforcement in which the platform monitors the possibility of any IP infringement including all legitimate products on the platform, the deterrence effect of its monitoring activity exceeds the monitoring cost if the number of patent holders is large. Then, in a simple model of two sellers without general enforcement effect, we show that under seller liability, awarding punitive damages with punitive multiplier equal to the reciprocal of the enforcement probability induces social optimum in which infringing entry occurs if and only if it is efficient, while platform liability may not induce social optimum.",2024,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1

Such protection is needed to maintain the integrity of Indigenous relationship to and control over such resources, while allowing for potential benefits from such resources to support tribal social and economic development. Using the case study of taramea (Aciphylla aurea), a sub-alpine speargrass, traditionally used to make fragrance by Ngai Tahu (a large tribe from the South Island, New Zealand), we assess potential approaches to protection, ranging from national and international intellectual property approaches such as trademarking, copyright and patenting to extra-legal approaches such as supply chain auditing, blockchain, biocultural trademarks and biocultural labels. From this assessment, we evaluate approaches' usefulness against a range of Indigenous and market-oriented attributes. We find that while each approach has advantages and disadvantages, no one method is superior, so we recommend a mix of approaches.",2023,Ethnic Studies,1

Its preparation method and medical use thereof have been patented in the United States (Patent No.US9751875B2). Objective In this study, the pharmacokinetics, mass balance, tissue distribution and metabolism of radioactive 101BHG-D01 were investigated in rats after an intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg [C-14]101BHG-D01 (100 mu Ci/kg). Methods Radioactivity in rat plasma, urine, feces, and tissues was measured by liquid scintillation counting (LSC), and metabolite profiling and identification were conducted by UHPLC-beta-RAM and UHPLC-Q-Exactive Plus MS. Results The total radioactivity of the study drug in rat plasma rapidly declined with an average terminal elimination half-life of 0.35 h. The radioactivity in most tissues reached the maximum concentration at 0.25 h post-dosing. The radioactivity mainly concentrated in the kidney and pancreas. The drug-related substances tended to be distributed into the blood cells in the circulation. At 168 h post dosing, the mean recovery of the total radioactivity in urine and feces was 78.82%. Fecal excretion was the major excretion route, accounting for approximately 61% of the radioactive dose. The study drug was metabolized extensively, and a total of 17 metabolites were identified in rat plasma, urine, and feces. The major metabolic pathways involved oxidation, oxidation and dehydrogenation, and O-dephenylation. Conclusion In conclusion, the study results are useful for better understanding the pharmacokinetic profiles of 101BHG-D01 and provide a robust foundation for subsequent clinical studies.",2023,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
"Voluntary licensing of long-acting HIV prevention and treatment regimens: using a proven collaboration- and competition-based mechanism to rapidly expand at-scale, sustainable, quality-assured and affordable supplies in LMICs",affordability; generic competition; global health; long-acting medicines; low- and middle-income countries; voluntary licensing; OPPORTUNITIES; FORMULATIONS; CHALLENGES; THERAPIES; PRODUCTS,"Introduction: Emerging long-acting (LA) prevention and treatment medicines, technologies and regimens could be game-changing for the HIV response, helping reach the ambitious goal of halting the epidemic by 2030. To attain this goal, the rapid expansion of at-scale, sustainable, quality-assured, and affordable supplies of LA HIV prevention and treatment products through accelerated and stronger competition, involving both originator and generic companies, will be essential. To do this, global health stakeholders should take advantage of voluntary licensing of intellectual property (IP) rights, such as through the United Nations-backed, not-for-profit Medicines Patent Pool, as a proven mechanism to support broad access to existing HIV medicines across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Discussion: While voluntary licensing may unlock the possibility for generic competition to take place ahead of patent expiry, there are additional elements-of amplified importance for more complex LA HIV medicines-that need to be taken into consideration. This paper discusses 10 enablers of voluntary licensing of IP rights as a model to rapidly expand at-scale, sustainable, quality-assured, and affordable supplies of LA HIV prevention and treatment regimens in LMICs: 1. Identifying promising LA technology platforms and drug formulations at an early developmental stage and engaging with patent holders 2. Consolidating a multidisciplinary network and strengthening early-stage coordination and collaboration to foster innovation 3. Embedding public health considerations in product design and delivery 4. Building innovative partnerships for product development and commercialization 5. Raising awareness of and creating demand for emerging LA products 6. Estimating the market size, ensuring sufficient competition and protecting sustainability 7. Using technology transfer and hands-on technical support to reduce product development timelines and costs 8. Exploring de-risking mechanisms and financial incentives to support generic manufacturers 9. Optimizing strategies for generic product development and regulatory filings 10. Aligning and coordinating efforts of stakeholders across the value chain. Conclusions: Rapid access to emerging LA prevention and treatment regimens and technologies can be facilitated by voluntary licensing-catalyzed and supplemented by enabling collaborative and non-duplicative efforts of various other stakeholders. This can effectively lead to improved-accelerated and cheaper-access to quality-assured medicines for populations in LMICs.",2023,Immunology; Infectious Diseases,1
Elucidation of an Allosteric Mode of Action for a Thienopyrazole RORγt Inverse Agonist,Nuclear Receptors; ROR gamma t; Allosteric Modulators; Structure Elucidation; Drug Discovery; MODULATORS; REFINEMENT; TARGETS,"The demand for allosteric targeting of nuclear receptors is high, but examples are limited, and structural information is scarce. The retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (ROR gamma t) is an important transcriptional regulator for the differentiation of T helper 17 cells for which the first, and some of the most promising, examples of allosteric nuclear receptor modulation have been reported and structurally proven. In a 2015 patent, filed by the pharmaceutical company Glenmark, a new class of small molecules was reported that act as potent inverse agonists for ROR gamma t. A compound library around the central thienopyrazole scaffold captured a clear structure-activity relationship, but the binding mechanism of this new class of ROR gamma t modulators has not been elucidated. Using a combination of biochemical and X-ray crystallography studies, here the allosteric mechanism for the inverse agonism for the most potent compound, classified in the patent as example 13, is reported, providing a strongly desired additional example of allosteric nuclear receptor targeting.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Is productivity of Indian pharmaceutical industry affected with the introduction of product patent act?,Data envelopment analysis; Indian pharmaceutical industry; Malmquist index; Productivity; Efficiency; Indian patent act; R&D; C02; C61; D24; L65; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; TECHNICAL PROGRESS; EFFICIENCY CHANGE; GROWTH; TRADE; DECOMPOSITION; SPILLOVERS; INVESTMENT; RESOURCE,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically study the impact of product patent regime on the productivity of different categories such as ownership, R&D, size and product-wise of Indian pharmaceutical firms using non-parametric data envelopment analysis. Design/methodology/approach The present study has applied Ray and Desli's Malmquist productivity index and its decomposition to measure total factor productivity (TFP) change, pure technical efficiency change, scale efficiency change and technical change under variable returns to scale (VRS) technology assumption for 141 Indian pharmaceutical firms during 2000-2001 to 2014-2015. Findings The study found the negligible impact of product patent regime on productivity. The technological change has played a positive role in the growth of productivity, whereas technical efficiency change depicts the judicious utilization of resources for improving performance. From the results, it is found that R&D intensive firms depict better stability in the TFP than the non-R&D firms. However, Granger causality between R&D and productivity found no relationship. Productivity is more directly affected by investment in fixed assets rather than in R&D, which focusses on incremental value additions in a largely branded/plain generic product market. In case of ownership, private foreign firms found to have registered progress in TFP while others have recorded marginal regress, which probably could be attributed to the superior marketing and management skills of the foreign firms, besides possessing proprietary technology. Both small and large firms have shown positive growth in the new regime as compared to the pre-patent regime. These small firms are able to compete with large firms because of their up-gradation of the technological base by improving access to better foreign technology. TFP growth for all the firms can be attributed to improvement in technology, and innovation in terms of high capital-output ratio. Further, the paper tried to identify the determinants of productivity from panel random effect regression, and it is found that export intensity, age and the new patent regime have negative and significant relationship with productivity, whereas other variables such as R&D, ownership, size and capital imports are insignificant. In the end, the results of sensitivity analysis have confirmed the validity of the selected variables. Practical implications The results suggest that Indian pharmaceutical firms need substantive improvement in TFP by improving managerial and scale efficiency. Indian pharmaceutical industry (IPI) needs to improve productivity across the network and drive cost excellence initiatives across the spend base through operational excellence and digital initiatives. The results of this paper can be applied in framing policies for future growth and improvement in the productivity of IPI. Originality/value The paper aims to make several new contributions to the existing literature. Most of the research papers only analysed TFP of the industry as a whole and detailed firm-wise analysis is needed to capture the true impact at a unit level. This study has analysed the impact of different categories such as ownership, R&D, size and product-wise, and determinants of productivity. The study has used a broader time period and larger panel data to predict the better picture.",2020,Development Studies,1

Patent foramen ovale in carcinoid heart disease: The potential role for and risks of percutaneous closure prior to cardiothoracic surgery,carcinoid heart disease; contrast echocardiography; neuroendocrine tumour; patent foramen ovale; percutaneous closure; DEVICE,"Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare but once metastasised, can lead to the release of vasoactive substances into the systemic circulation, and the classical features of carcinoid syndrome (CS) such as flushing and diarrhoea. A consequence of CS is carcinoid heart disease (CHD) which primarily affects the right-sided heart valves and can eventually lead to right heart failure. In this cohort, tricuspid and/or pulmonary valve replacement provides symptomatic relief. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) in patients with CHD can lead to the shunting of oxygen deficient blood to the systemic circulation causing hypoxaemia and reduced exercise tolerance. Additionally, the haemodynamic changes caused by regurgitant right-sided heart valves can increase the patency of a PFO allowing the passage of vasoactive substances to the systemic circulation thereby affecting the left-sided heart valves. We present data on the incidence of PFO in patients referred for surgery at our centre, in which the standard approach is to close the defect at time of cardiothoracic surgery. In addition, we present a series of four cases that highlight how the option of percutaneous PFO closure prior to open valve surgery may reduce haemodynamic instability and open a window of opportunity to enhance preoperative status. Percutaneous PFO closure then acts as a bridge to definitive cardiothoracic surgery, although there are risks in such an approach.",2023,Endocrinology & Metabolism; Neurosciences & Neurology,1

In addition, the increasing reports of the emergence of viral epidemics highlight, the need for novel molecules with antiviral potential. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with antiviral activity or antiviral peptides (AVPs) have turned into a research hotspot and already show tremendous potential to become pharmaceutically available antiviral medicines. AMPs, a diverse group of bioactive peptides act as a part of our first line of defense against pathogen inactivation. Although most of the currently reported AMPs are either antibacterial or antifungal peptides, the number of antiviral peptides is gradually increasing. Some of the AMPs that are shown as effective antivirals have been deployed against viruses such as influenza A virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), HIV, HSV, West Nile Virus (WNV), and other viruses. This review offers an overview of AVPs that have been approved within the past few years and will set out a few of the most essential patents and their usage within the context mentioned above during 2000-2020.

"Why Can't We Be FRANDs?: Anti-Suit Injunctions, International Comity, and International Commercial Arbitration in Standard-Essential Patent Litigation",; ,"Picking up a smartphone to contact someone across the globe is facilitated by technical standards like 5G. These standards allow for technological compatibility worldwide. For instance, a 5G capable device can connect to 5G networks anywhere in the world because the same 5G standard is used globally. Standards, particularly those integral to the telecommunications industry, are also highly complex and contain many patents that are necessarily infringed when the standard is implemented. To avoid rampant patent infringement, owners of these standard-essential patents (SEPs) are required to license them to standard implementers at fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) rates when their patents are incorporated into a standard. Apart from that, standard setting organizations (SSOs) provide minimal guidance about what rates are FRAND. As a result, SEP litigation over whether a rate is FRAND has spiked. Courts hearing FRAND cases can set global rates, but patent rights are territorial. In response to the threat of foreign courts setting rates on patents granted in their jurisdiction, some courts have issued anti-suit injunctions to prevent parties from litigating a FRAND dispute elsewhere. This rise in antisuit injunctions has resulted in some courts turning to anti-anti-suit injunctions as a response or preemptive measure. Parties have even petitioned courts for anti-anti-anti-suit injunctions. This spiral poses a threat to international comity because these injunctions, although directed at the litigants, interfere with a foreign court's ability to decide what to do with a matter before it. Within the FRAND context, an added danger is the potential breakdown of future technological interoperability if some parts of the world adopt different standards than others. For example, this might make some smartphones incompatible with some cellular data networks. In place of litigation, international commercial arbitration has been used with some success in FRAND disputes, but there are downsides to using arbitration alone. This Note recommends federal courts grant anti-suit injunctions in SEP litigation only under a restrictive test, rather than maintaining the current variation by circuit. Injunctions that up the anti should face greater scrutiny under a stricter test with international comity guiding the decision through concrete factors outlined in the sections on nonrecognition of foreign judgments in the Restatement (Fourth) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States. The Note further suggests that Congress should codify this test, but in the event of an injunction spiral that might preclude litigation altogether, SSOs should require the parties arbitrate the dispute before experts at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Together, litigation and arbitration can help preserve the interconnected and technologically compatible system currently in place around the world.",2022,Government & Law,1
CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR THE TRAFFICKING IN COUNTERFEITED MEDICINAL PRODUCTS: PROBLEMS OF LEGISLATION AND ENFORCEMENT IN UKRAINE,counterfeiting; criminal liability; drugs; superpotent; toxic; ,"The paper focuses on consideration of factors of international, socio-economic and legal nature that determine the dynamics and content of criminal liability for trafficking in counterfeit medicines in Ukraine. Some discussion points, both theoretical and legal, concerning trafficking in counterfeit medicines are considered. Attention is drawn to the fact that counterfeits' volume is highly dependent on the amount of patent advertising of medicines, which is an appropriate benchmark for criminals who manufacture low-quality and unregistered medicines, mainly in underground handicraft production. Particular attention is paid to the ratio of counterfeiting and patent advertising of medicines. It is investigated Art. 321-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, in accordance with the perfection and clarity of legislative definitions, their compliance with requirements of systematic interrelation of criminal law provisions, justice principles and differentiation of criminal liability. It is proved that it is important to develop our own legislative and enforcement experience in the field of preventing the trafficking in of counterfeit medicines, systematic principled approaches in the part of regulatory legal formulations and their judicial interpretation during practical application.

PROPERTY RIGHT ACQUISITION AND PATH DEPENDENCE: NINETEENTH-CENTURY LAND POLICY AND MODERN ECONOMIC OUTCOMES,; DETERMINANTS; LANDSCAPE; ORIGINS; IMPACT; GROWTH; SHOCKS; WEST,"In this paper we compare lands settled between 1862-1940 under the Homestead Act to lands that sold for cash during the same time. We combine recently digitised individual land patents with modern satellite data and find a negative effect of homesteading on modern land use that cannot be explained by land quality, title characteristics or unobserved differences in settlers. We test the hypothesis that early homestead settlement put homesteaders 'in the way' of future development, creating a path dependence in land use decisions for homesteads, despite the fact that their legal rights were identical to purchased lands.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Health Care and the Limits of Progressive Neoliberalism: Re-Evaluating the Trade-Health Interface 2006-2019,trade policy; health policy; progressive neoliberalism; investment law; drug policy; ,"From 1995 to 2006, Canadian trade policy purported to insulate the Canadian health care system from the effects of trade liberalization, largely through reliance upon key general exclusion clauses in the NAFTA and the GATS and other legal strategies. During the Conservative years 2006-2015 the government de-emphasized these strategies, and (more importantly) the international trade agenda increasingly emphasized investment promotion and patent protection. When the Liberal Party returned to government in 2015, personal, structural, and ideological factors all pointed to the retention of the neoliberal trade agenda, but one which was legitimated by more 'progressive' features, such as side-agreements. This paper traces the evolution of 'progressive neoliberalism' in the trade-health interface and argues that we need to recognize the inherent limitations of an approach that preaches harmony and coherence between domestic health care and international trade law.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Addressing the Risks That Trade Secret Protections Pose for Health and Rights,; INFORMATION; COMPETITION; BIAS,"Human rights frameworks afford everyone the right to health and the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications. Both come together to create state obligations to ensure access to medicines and other health technologies. Though the impact of patents on access to high-quality, affordable medicines and health technologies has been well described, there has been little attention to the impact of trade secrecy law in this context. In this paper, we describe how trade secrecy protection comes into conflict with access to medicines-for example, by preventing researchers from accessing clinical trial data, undermining the scale-up of manufacturing in pandemics, and deterring whistleblowers from reporting industry misconduct. The paper proposes measures to diminish the conflict between trade secrecy and health that are consistent with international law and will advance health without undermining innovation.",2021,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
Does Conjoint Analysis Reliably Value Patents?,; ,"Modern technology products are often covered by thousands of patents. Yet awards for a single component have averaged a surprisingly high 9.98% of the infringing product's price. To curb such disproportionate awards, the law insists that damages reflect the contribution made by the patent. But determining how to apportion damages in this way has proved to be elusive. One emerging technique that appears to offer rigor is conjoint analysis, a type of survey borrowed from the marketing world. This article explores the validity of the conjoint analysis technique by running two conjoint analysis surveys. Unfortunately, we found serious problems. First, the results of our surveys yielded irrationally high numbers. Most survey features suffered from bizarrely high valuations. Second, we demonstrate how experts can manipulate the results by selecting among a number of different ostensibly reasonable statistical choices and picking the one that yields the most desirable outcome. Based on these findings, we provide several recommendations. First, we argue that courts should not allow evidence of conjoint analysis to show the monetary value of specific features. However, we recognize that there is support for using conjoint analysis to provide relative valuations (i.e., feature A is worth significantly more than feature B). To the extent that courts permit this use, we suggest ways to ensure that experts employ the best science available. These recommendations include assuring that experts accurately depict variability in their results and requiring experts to preregister the approach they intend to use with the court.",2021,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1
Human to machine innovation: Does legal personhood and inventorship threshold offer any leeway?,AI personhood; artificial intelligence; DABUS; inventorship; patent; ,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to be a powerful tool in the research and development ecosystem. AI computers are invented to assist human invention and also created to invent. Where an AI is created to invent, through self-learning, they can interact with set of data presumably created by humans and as a result, a new patentable invention(s) can emerge. However, where the AI inventors and the resulting inventions sit within the inventorship legal framework, and the theory of legal personhood continues to raise legal and policy questions that challenge some underlying or presumed settled intellectual property law assumptions. One of the contentions has been the implications of the AI machine's autonomous inventions on the legislative and judicially established threshold for patent inventorship and the jurisprudential theory of legal personhood. The judicial decisions in the United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (UK), and Australia in the Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience (DABUS) patent applications have given judicial certainty on whether AI machine inventors qualify as inventors. However, they also reawakened the debate about the need to sustain patent incentives for AI innovations. This article draws from the inventorship threshold in the UK and US following the court decisions in the DABUS cases. The judicial decisions of courts and the administrative judgements of national Intellectual Property Offices (IPOs) relating to inventorship as well as the theory of legal personhood, reveal that an AI machine invention can be patent eligible. However, the machine does not satisfy the inventorship criteria and consequently is incapable of being named an inventor. On the other hand, the inventorship requirement of contemporaneous conception and reduction to practice meant that an AI owner/programmer may not satisfy the requirement of inventorship, even though he/she programmed the inventing machine. These decisions and judgements favour an implied situation where autonomous AI inventions could be without named inventors and owners. Consequently, those inventions will automatically form part of prior arts thereby rendering myriads of future human and AI inventions obvious or already existing in the public domain. In contributing to the discourse, this article advances the argument that to optimise the patent system, national IPOs and the courts can rely on 'simultaneous conception and reduction to practice' to recognise the programmer/owner or other relevant stakeholders in AI innovation as the inventor of AI autonomous inventions.",2024,Government & Law,1
COMPULSORY LICENSING IN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY: CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS AND PROSPECTS,compulsory licensing; competition in pharmaceutical industry; drugs; PEST-analysis; COMPETITION,"The problem of compulsory licensing (CL) in the pharmaceutical industry is being discussed worldwide. The aim of this paper was to analyze the effects of using CL for pharmaceutical drugs (PD) as part of competitive policies aimed at safeguarding the life and health of the population. Using PEST-analysis, we identify the main political, economic, social and technological problems associated with using CL in the pharmaceutical industry. We demonstrate the potential of CL as a tool for countering the threats to public health caused by the abuse of market dominance by pharmaceutical patent holders. At present, both developers of pharmaceutical innovations (patent-holders) and other entities involved in drug circulation are protected by law. There is ongoing debate about the efficacy of CL as a tool ensuring the implementation of competitive policies aimed at safeguarding the rights to life and health. However, in Russia CL is applied only under exceptional circumstances. An economic balance should be sought between the incentives for innovation, long-term profits from selling PDs and PD accessibility.",2021,General & Internal Medicine,1
Legal incentives for innovations in the emotional AI domain: a carrot and stick approach?,; ,"center dot Emotions strongly influence the human way of living and life experiences. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are crucial to pushing developments further. Although emotional AI-driven innovations are welcome in our society, they might also have negative effects on the interdependence and autonomy of natural persons. Thus, they might be challenged by several legal provisions in the EU such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the draft AI Act. Yet these inventions require considerable investment, where legal incentives such as intellectual property rights (IPR) are crucial. Indeed, it is also important to secure certainty as to the legal and ethical acceptability of such innovations. center dot This article looks at emotional AI to investigate the interlinkage between technological innovations, legal incentives and ethics, through the lenses of patent law and fundamental rights, in order to shed light over the challenges, limitations, but also opportunities for the protection, commercialization and exploitation of emotional AI-related inventions. center dot Our research offers new scientific knowledge on the largely under-explored issue of legal incentives for emotional AI-related inventions in the European framework.

We use the timing and geography of the French occupation of different German regions after the French Revolution of 1789 as an instrument for institutional quality. We find that the number of patents per capita in counties with the longest occupation was more than double that in unoccupied counties. Among the institutional changes brought by the French, the introduction of the Code civil, ensuring equality before the law, and the promotion of commercial freedom through the abolition of guilds and trade licenses had a stronger effect on innovation than the abolition of serfdom, which increased labor market mobility, and agricultural reforms that broke up the power of rural elites. The effect of institutions on innovation is particularly pronounced for high-tech innovation, suggesting that innovationmight be a key channel through which institutions ultimately affect economic growth. Our findings highlight inclusive institutions as a first-order determinant of innovation.",2023,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,1

This study analyzed the spatial characteristics of the Urban Cooperative Innovation Network in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, found out the dynamic evolution law of innovation, provided suggestions for policy management departments, and effectively planned the industrial layout. According to the data of the State Intellectual Property Office of China, this study researched invention patents from 2005 to 2019. This paper constructed the urban cooperative innovation network, and took 11 cities in the bay area as the research objects, and used social network analysis to study the spatial structure and dynamic evolution of the urban innovation network. Every indicator reflected the urban cooperative innovation, but they all showed a certain decline in 2008-2010. And it is inferred that the innovation network space of each city will be obvious fist advantages, significant spillover effect and weakening role of Hong Kong and Macao.

Summing up the characteristics of each stage is helpful to recognize the changes of urban cooperative innovation and to do a good job in industrial layout planning.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Antisuit Injunctions in Chinese Courts,; SUIT INJUNCTIONS,"The increasingly intensified competition arose among national courts over their judicial authority to resolve standard-essential patents (SEPs) disputes. This competition drove courts and litigants to resort to antisuit injunctions (ASIs) more frequently. However, ASIs Chinese courts issued in SEP-related cases raised concerns in foreign countries. Chinese ASIs' legal basis has evolved through decades of legislation regarding injunctions, including compulsory maritime orders, IPR preliminary injunctions, and general rules of act preservation, despite containing inherent defects that troubled the subsequent antisuit practice. Likewise, Chinese antisuit practice did not emerge overnight but took years to develop, growing from a mere sprinkle in maritime litigations to a respectable drizzle in SEP-related actions. It encompasses orders to prevent foreign collateral proceedings, the injunction to inhibit foreign antisuit orders, and orders to halt foreign substantive proceedings. Chinese antisuit practice is at its nascence and exhibits striking features in SEP cases. However, closely examining Chinese antisuit decisions in SEP cases reveals that so-called Chinese worldwide ASIs were justifiable and legitimate, in terms of substantive conditions and actual operation, even by the EU and US standards. Nevertheless, China needs to reform the relevant laws regarding antisuit relief and refine its antisuit practice in various aspects to fend off due process and other equitable concerns. Only through international coordination can national courts efficaciously tackle the proliferation of antisuit relief in SEP cases.",2023,International Relations; Government & Law,1
Cybercrimes and Alternative Settlement of Intellectual Property (IPR) Disputes in Indonesia,alternative dispute resolution; cyberspace; intellectual property; arbitration; ,"This study aimed to analyze the violation of IPR in the context of cybercrimes in Indonesia, particularly those where foreign investors are involved and an alternative arbitrary mechanism was adopted. The data was collected through a review of archives, previous literature and the government regulations that regulate foreign arbitration in international agreements. The study found out that the Indonesian government has filled the void in foreign arbitration regulations though IPR laws such as Law No. 31 of 2000 concerning Industrial Design, Law No. 30 of 2000 concerning Trade Secrets, Law No. 32 of 2001 concerning Layout Design of Integrated Circuits, Law No. 28 of 2014 concerning Copyright, Law No. 13 of 2016 concerning Patents, and Law No. 20 of 2016 concerning Trademarks and Geographical Indications. The study also found out that currently there is no statute in the country which explicitly permits the arbitration for disputes regarding cybercrimes or online crimes committed in IPR domains like copyrights and trademark disputes. However, when arbitration is chosen as the alternative dispute resolution mechanism for IPR reacted issues, Intellectual Property Rights Arbitration and Mediation Body (Badan Arbitrase dan Mediasi Hak Kekayaan Intelektual, BAMHKI) is entrusted the task to work as an arbitration agency. Despite these regulatory initiatives, however, it was found that there is still a need to adopt a protection mechanism against cybercrimes that are exceeding in number owing to the abuse of Internet and technology. The study recommends the Indonesian government to provide remedies against cybercrimes to all capital providers and foreign investors in order to attract foreign investors and to give confidence to entrepreneurs from developed countries.",2022,Criminology & Penology,1
DISABILITY AND DESIGN,; HEDONIC ADAPTATION; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; LAW; WHEELCHAIRS; INNOVATION; HISTORY; POLICY; RIGHTS; WORLD; REHABILITATION,"When scholars contemplate the legal tools available to policymakers for encouraging innovation, they primarily think about patents. If they are keeping up with the most recent literature, they may also consider grants, prizes, and taxes as means to increase the supply of innovation. But the innovation policy toolkit is substantially deeper than that. To demonstrate its depth, this Article explores the evolution of designs that help people with disabilities access the world around them. From artificial limbs to the modern wheelchair and the reshaping of the built environment, a variety of legal doctrines have influenced, for better and for worse, the pace and direction of innovation for accessible design. This Article argues that two of the most important drivers of innovation for accessible design have been social welfare laws and antidiscrimination laws. Both were responsible, in part, for the revolution in accessibility that occurred in the second half of the twentieth century. Unlike standard innovation incentives, however, these laws operate on the demand side of the market. Social welfare laws and antidiscrimination laws increase the ability and willingness of parties to pay for accessible technology, ultimately leading to greater supply. But in doing so, these laws generate a different distribution of the costs and benefits of innovation than supply-side incentives. They also produce their own sets of innovation distortions by allowing third parties to make decisions about the designs that people with disabilities have to use. The law can promote innovation, and it can hinder it. For example, the law's relationship to the wheelchair, the most important accessibility innovation of the twentieth century, produced both results. Policymakers have choices about which legal incentives doctrines they can use and how they can use them. This Article evaluates those tools, and it provides guidelines for their use to encourage accessible technology in particular and innovation generally.",2020,Government & Law,1
Design Litigation in the EU Member States: Are Overlaps with Other Intellectual Property Rights and Unfair Competition Problematic and are SMEs Benefitting from the EU Design Legal Framework?,Copyright; Design right; EU law; Patents; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Trade marks; Unfair competition; ,"Genuine overlaps (several intellectual property rights (IPR) applying to the same intellectual effort) can create overprotection. There is hardly any empirical legal research done on how claimants have litigated at national level not only on their design rights but also on another IPR or unfair competition. This article fills this gap by examining the decisions on all types of design rights (registered and unregistered) from the courts of the 28 Member States since the entry into force of the Design Directive and Design Regulation until August 2017, where claimants also sued on the basis of another IPR namely patents, utility models, trade marks, copyright, and the tort of slavish imitation. The article also determines the proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and big companies who litigate and their rate of winning. This gives the extent of the use of the EU design right system by type of company and an indication of its success.",2021,Government & Law,1

However, indigenous peoples have been using ayahuasca therapeutically for a very long time, and thus we question the epistemic authority attributed to scientific studies, proposing that epistemic injustices were committed with practical, cultural, social, and legal consequences. We question epistemic authority based on the double-blind design, the molecularization discourse, and contextual issues about safety. We propose a new approach to foster epistemically fair research, outlining how to enforce indigenous rights, considering the Brazilian, Peruvian, and Colombian cases. Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect, and develop their biocultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and cultural expressions, including traditional medicine practices. New regulations about ayahuasca must respect the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples according to the International Labor Organization Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention no. 169. The declaration of the ayahuasca complex as a national cultural heritage may prevent patenting from third parties, fostering the development of traditional medicine. When involving isolated compounds derived from traditional knowledge, benefit-sharing agreements are mandatory according to the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity. Considering the extremely high demand to treat millions of depressed patients, the medicalization of ayahuasca without adequate regulation respectful of indigenous rights can be detrimental to indigenous peoples and their management of local environments, potentially harming the sustainability of the plants and of the Amazon itself, which is approaching its dieback tipping point.",2022,Anthropology; Psychiatry,1
The International Legal Problems of Ensuring the Availability of Medications in Conditions of the COVID-19,Pharmaceutical market; COVID-19; medications; patent protection; parallel imports; medical law; ,"In the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the risks of individual pharmaceutical market players or groups of players taking measures to supply medications that may lead to an economically unjustified increase in drug prices or artificially create a shortage of products are increasing worldwide. Aims: Finding the best way to protecting intellectual property rights for medications in conditions of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Methods: The methodological basis of the study was formed by an integral and coordinated system of scientific methods that contributed to the study of such a complex socio-legal phenomenon as the availability of medicinal products in conditions of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, a synergistic approach was applied, which combined the special research methods of various branches of law, pharmaceutical science and practice. Results: The article reveals and identifies the distinctive features of using patent protection measures and parallel imports in the drug markets of various countries of the world and the impact of the TRIPS Agreement on the availability of medications for the public in conditions of the COVID-19. Conclusion: For many countries, including Ukraine, the introduction of parallel imports can be efficient in the short term. Allowing parallel imports of medications has significantly fewer negative consequences for the copyright holder, since the improper quality of the products, in which the invention is used without the use of a trademark, most often does not affect the business reputation of the patent owner. Nevertheless, the chosen model of permitting the use of parallel imports to ensure the availability of medications in Ukraine remains a topical and controversial issue that requires a lot of professional discussion. Legislators should be very careful and cautious about the development and implementation of the institution of parallel imports of medications to Ukraine paying attention to the development of a whole system of quality and transparency control for procedures related to parallel imports to this country.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

The bulk composition of the body and the glaze have been found to have a Ca-Al-Si composition and therefore demonstrate congruency with the specification of the Edward Heylyn and Thomas Frye patent of 1744. The patent specification required the porcelain paste to be prepared using unaker clay from the Carolinas and a lime-alkali glass in varying proportions from 1:1 to 4:1, which when fired at temperatures now shown to range upwards of 1280 degrees C vitrifies to form a refractory porcelain containing beta-wollastonite, the calcic plagioclase feldspar anorthite, diopside and mullite. The glaze used was similarly formulated but required lower levels of aluminous clay and a higher proportion of the glass flux to enable vitrification to occur at a lower melting temperature and therefore acting as an optical pyrometer. Crystallites of wollastonite, diopside and cassiterite were recorded in the glaze. Compositions of the blue, black, brown, gold, green, red and purple decorations applied as overglaze enamels have been determined. It is concluded that this porcelain group is attributed to Bow manufacture in East London c. 1744-1745.",2022,Spectroscopy,1

Aim Based on this document, a Southeast Asia Working Group (SEAWG) wished to see how the new ESCEO algorithm developed in 2019 was perceived by Southeast Asian experts and how it was integrated into their clinical practice. Methods A SEAWG was set up between members of the international ESCEO task force and a group of Southeast Asian experts. Results Non-pharmacological management should always be combined with pharmacological management. In step 1, symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis are the main background therapy, for which high-quality evidence is available only for the formulations of patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. In step 2, oral NSAIDs are a useful option, considering the cardiovascular/renal/gastrointestinal profiles of the individual patient. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid and corticosteroids are a possible alternative to oral NSAIDs, but limited evidence is available. If steps 1 and 2 do not give adequate relief of symptoms, tramadol can be used, but its safety is debated. In general, the indications of the ESCEO algorithm are important in Southeast Asian countries, but the reimbursement criteria of local health systems are an important aspect for adherence to the ESCEO algorithm. Conclusion This guidance provides evidence-based and easy-to-follow advice on how to establish a treatment algorithm in knee OA, for practical implementation in clinical practice in Southeast Asian countries.",2021,Geriatrics & Gerontology,1

This article explores the reasons for this decline and suggests a structure, the open science partnership, as one mechanism through which to slow down or reverse this decline. The article examines the empirical literature of the last century to document the decline. This literature suggests that the cost of research and innovation is increasing exponentially, that researcher productivity is declining, and, third, that these two phenomea have led to an overall flat or declining level of innovation productivity. The article then turns to three explanations for the decline ? the growing complexity of science, a mismatch of incentives, and a balkanization of knowledge. Finally, the article explores the role that open science partnerships ? public-private partnerships based on open access publications, open data and materials, and the avoidance of restrictive forms of intellectual property ? can play in increasing the efficiency of the innovation system.",2021,Business & Economics,1
INTEGRATING FARMERS' RIGHT TO TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL KNOWLEDGE INTO MALAYSIA PLANT VARIETY LAW,Farmers' rights; Right to traditional agricultural knowledge; FAO Treaty 2004; Plant variety law; Malaysia; ,"Lauded as stewards of agricultural biodiversity, successive generations of farmers have engaged in collective systems of conservation and innovation in improving crops since the earliest plant domestications. Their ancestral knowledge and practices have witnessed the sharing of the reproductive material between them since thereon. Modern agricultural expansion and development have contributed to the flow of crops globally. Intellectual property rights in the agricultural field such as patents and plant breeders' right, to a certain extent have affected these traditional agricultural practises of the farmers. Nonetheless in many parts of the world, where small farming communities still form an integral part of their food production chain, farmers' traditional farming practices and knowledge are still widely used. This paper argues that over reliance on modern system of agricultural and intellectual property rights in the long run might threaten these small farmers' communities and suggest that the Farmers' Rights concept as enshrined in the FAO Treaty 2004 should be integrated into national legislations affecting farmers. Applying doctrinal analysis on existing plant variety law in Malaysia, this article investigates the extent to which the concept of Farmers' Rights to their traditional agricultural practices has been incorporated into the law. By way of comparison with the practices in India, a country quoted as having best practices in implementing Farmers' Right, the paper attempt to suggest on the possible way to integrate their practices into the Malaysia plant variety law.",2020,Business & Economics,1
Proprietary information and the cost of bank debt,Proprietary Information; Bank loan fee structure; Competitive bid option (CBO); G21; G28; G32; INNOVATION; CREDIT; INVESTMENT; INCENTIVES; MARKET; LINES,"Purpose This study explores how the firm's proprietary information has an impact on the bank loan contracts. It explains the propensity of using the competitive bid option (CBO) in the syndicate loans to solicit the best bid for innovative firms and how it changes based on industry competition and the degree of innovations. This research also examines how the interstate banking deregulation (Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act) in 1994 affected the private loan contracts for innovative borrowers. Design/methodology/approach The study uses various econometric analyses. First, it uses the propensity score matching analysis to see the impact of patents on pricing terms. Second, it uses the two-stage least square (2SLS) analysis by implementing the litigation and non-NYSE variables. Finally, it studies the impact of the policy change of the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 on the bank loan contracts. Findings Firms with more proprietary information pays more annual facility fees but less other fees. The patents are the primary determinants of the usage of CBO in the syndicate loans to solicit the best bid. While innovative firms can have better contract conditions by the CBO, firms with more proprietary information will less likely to use the CBO option to minimize the leakage of private information and the severe monitoring from the banks. Finally, more proprietary information lowered the loan spread for firms dependent on the external capital after the interstate banking deregulation. Originality/value The findings of this research will help senior executives with responsibility for financing their innovative projects. In addition, these findings should prove helpful for the lawmakers to boost economies.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Racial and Ethnic Diversity in Studies Funded Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act,; HEALTH-CARE ACCESS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; MINORITY PARTICIPATION; SERVICES; FILIPINO; CHINESE; BURDEN,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes the study of on-patent medicines in children and mandates that the National Institutes of Health sponsor research on off-patent drugs important to pediatric therapeutics. Failing to enroll cohorts that reflect the pediatric population at large restricts the generalizability of such studies. In this investigation, we evaluate racial and ethnic minority representation among participants enrolled in BPCA-sponsored studies. METHODS: Data were obtained for all participants enrolled in 33 federally funded studies of drugs and devices conducted from 2008 through June 2020. Observed racial and ethnic distributions were compared with expected distributions by sampling Census data at the same geographic frequency as in the studies. Racial and ethnic enrollment was examined by demography, geography, study type, study burden, and expected bias. Standard descriptive statistics, chi(2), generalized linear models, and linear regression were applied. RESULTS: A total of 10 918 participants (51% male, 6.6 +/- 8.2 years) were enrolled across 46 US states and 4 countries. Studies ranged from treatment outcome reviews to randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Minority enrollment was comparable to, or higher than, expected (+0.1% to +2.6%) for all groups except Asian Americans (-3.7%, P < .001). American Indian and Alaskan Native and multiracial enrollment significantly increased over the evaluation period (P < .01). There were no significant differences in racial distribution as a function of age or sex, although differences were observed on the basis of geography, study type, and study burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study revealed no evidence of racial and ethnic bias in enrollment for pediatric studies conducted with funding from BPCA, fulfilling the legislation's expectation to ensure adequate representation of all children.",2021,Pediatrics,1

We document that IP protection enforcement can significantly and negatively mitigate the infringer's innovation investment persistence but positively enhance that of the infringed firm. This effect is more pronounced for non-high-tech or non-state-owned firms. Moreover, IP protection mainly reshapes a firm's perceptions of innovation investment persistence through the efficiency and fairness of law enforcement. Our findings provide insights into optimizing the IP protection environment, especially for emerging economies.",2024,Business & Economics,1

After a bankruptcy, U.S. inventors produce fewer and less impactful patents. Moreover, teams become less stable. Consequently, compared to inventors that rely less on teamwork, the performance of team inventors deteriorates more. These findings point to the loss of team-specific human capital as a cost of resource reallocation through bankruptcy.

Evidence from Medical Implants,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TORT REFORM; IMPACT; STANDARDS,"Liability laws designed to compensate for harms caused by defective products may also affect innovation. We examine this issue by exploiting a major quasi-exogenous increase in liability risk faced by US suppliers of polymers used to manufacture medical implants. Difference-in-difference analyses show that this surge in suppliers' liability risk had a large and negative impact on downstream innovation in medical implants, but it had no significant effect on upstream polymer patenting. Our findings suggest that liability risk can percolate throughout a vertical chain and may have a significant chilling effect on downstream innovation.",2022,Business & Economics,1

Cleaner production promotion law and pollution: Firm level evidence from China,Pollution emission; Cleaner production; Sulfur dioxide; Firm heterogeneity; Porter effect; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; INTERMEDIATE INPUTS; KUZNETS CURVE; GROWTH; CONSEQUENCES; ENFORCEMENT; ABATEMENT; INDUSTRY,"Using the formulation and implementation of China's Cleaner Production Promotion Law (CPPL) in 2003 as a quasi-natural experiment and a unique combined dataset of Annual Survey of Industrial Production Database and China Industrial Enterprise Pollution Emissions Database over 1998-2013, we investigate the impact of ex -ante prevention policies on firm pollution emissions. Our DID and DDD results show that: 1) The CPPL has significantly reduced firm's per unit of output emissions of SO2 and COD; 2) China's CPPL reduced firm pollution emissions intensity by reducing resource consumption, increasing firms' TFP and the number of green patents (Porter effect), and increasing the total amount of pollutants removal per unit of output; 3) The impact of CPPL on pollution shows modest firm heterogeneity, with larger effects on SOEs and on largescale enterprises. The conclusions of this paper reveal that China's CPPL, as a formal rule of law regulation and ex -ante prevention policy, not only reduces the pollution intensity of enterprises from the input side, but also stimulate the Porter effect, and reduces the pollution removal level.",2024,Business & Economics,1
What drives the production and diffusion of mobile apps? An international investigation,; INNOVATION,"Mobile apps have proliferated online in recent years, but related formal research has lagged behind. Using data on a large sample of nations over the years 2018-2020, we estimate the drivers of mobile app production. Results show that more mobile subscribers (capturing demand-pull effects) increase mobile app production. However, overall E-participation fails to exert a significant influence. Both FDI inflows and ICT imports contribute to mobile app production, as do the inputs and outputs of overall technological change (patents, researchers, and knowledge workers).

Theatrical Arbitration in Georgian England,Arbitration; ADR; theatre; business; politics; culture; Georgian; Sheridan; THEATER,"The connection between theatre and the law has been much explored, and especially the theatricality of the courtroom, which developed in the late Georgian era. This article seeks to look beyond the law to a wider culture of dispute settlement, of which legal proceedings were only a single subset, and in some ways a deeply unpopular one. The business of theatre provides a window onto this culture, not least because theatre proprietors were extremely disputatious, both due to their personality and for a range of structural and legal reasons, including the monopolistic regime of theatre patents. The resolution of disputes was often performative, requiring a repertoire including legal threats and suits, but mediation and arbitration might provide cheaper and quicker resolution, with less reputational damage. Indeed, arbitration was so familiar to theatre folk that it featured in plays, which explored its wider cultural meaning. Managing theatre arbitrations was also politically charged, because of the political language used, the involvement of the political and aristocratic elite, and the immediate need to resolve disputes with audiences and even pacify riots. This article thus seeks to affirm the importance of arbitration in the interconnected areas of Georgian theatre, law, business and politics.",2022,History,1
"COVID-19, vaccines and international knowledge governance on trial",TRIPS Agreement; patents; regulatory approval; innovation incentives; COVID-19 vaccines; compulsory licensing; national security; LESSONS; TRIPS,"The production, distribution and availability of vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are all impacted by the international rules of knowledge governance. These rules include patents, trade secrets and health and efficacy regulatory approval processes. This article discusses how these intellectual property related mechanisms all interfered with vaccine availability. It analyses the international rules, related exceptions (including compulsory licensing and national security) and the possible waiver of the relevant rules found in the World Trade Organization TRIPS Agreement. Throughout the first two years of the pandemic, vaccines were not available widely enough. Although most of the developed world had enough vaccine doses by late 2021, that was not the position in much of the developing world, where the problem became the distribution of vaccines. Distribution may have always been difficult, but the failures in timely local supply exacerbated the problem of vaccine inequality between the developed and developing world. The inequality had several likely causes including intellectual property rules. The problem was not necessarily the existence of patents (or other rules) but the insufficiency of checks and balances that are necessary to address global public health needs. This resulted in private interests, whose primary goal is not public health, wielding too much power. The article concludes that collectively the effect of the international rules enacted in domestic laws supports a regime that was not fit for purpose to address the COVID- 19 pandemic and is not fit to address future pandemics.",2022,Government & Law,1
Competition and Congestion in Trademark Law,; US PATENT; TAKE-UP; COST; TOO,"Trademark law exists to promote competition. If consumers know which companies make which products, they can more easily find the products they actually want to purchase. Trademark law has long treated source significance-the fact that a particular trademark is identified with a particular producer-as both necessary and sufficient for establishing a valid trademark. That is, trademark law has traditionally viewed source significance as the only necessary precondition for a trademark being pro-competitive. In this Article, we argue that this equation of source significance and pro-competitiveness is misguided. Some marks use words that are so closely connected with the product being branded that giving just one firm a monopoly over those words provides that firm with a meaningful competitive advantage-an artificial advantage granted by the state. This problem becomes worse as the number of firms producing (and branding) a type of product increases. The more words cordoned off by trademark law, the more trouble a new entrant will have in describing or attracting attention to its product. Trademark law is thus being hijacked by strategic firms for anticompetitive purposes. Traditional doctrinal tools are inadequate to address this problem because the goal should be to limit the number of such trademarks rather than eliminate them completely. However, costly screens could be used to impose a form of congestion pricing on trademarks, eliminating them in all but the most worthwhile cases. In this Article, we develop a theory of the anticompetitive nature of certain trademark rules. We then propose a series of overlapping doctrinal rules and costly screens to address the problem of rampant anticompetitive trademarks.",2024,Government & Law,1
Cobalt recycling patents dataset selected using 'green' classification codes: Focus on the nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) batteries recycling,Patent intelligence; Circular economy; Green transition; ,"The Critical Raw Materials Act has been emanated to address perceived risks around supply chains for critical raw materials in light of expected demand growth [1] . Cobalt is one of the critical raw materials for the EU: it plays a central role in transition to a low-carbon economy and is crucial for batteries powering electric vehicles. The cobalt industry is important not only because of the green transition, it also creates employment opportunities as Europe is the third largest region for total global cobalt value chain employment [2] . The global market for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is continuously increasing which results in higher material demand for the production of Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Especially Lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) batteries are one of the leading types of batteries deployed on BEVs and recovering of materials from used batteries for producing new battery materials may mitigate the material supply risk [3 , 4] . The present survey concerns the creation and comparison of two datasets of patents concerning Cobalt recycling, respectively achieved without (dataset 1) and with (dataset 2) the addition of one specific 'green' CPC classification code to a huge list of classification codes concerning recycling. Namely, the CPC Y02P10/20 determines a significant improvement on the exhaustivity of the search regarding Cobalt recycling in dataset 2, on the other hand it might also generate issues evidenced by a subsequent selection of those records in prin ciple focused on the recovery of NMC batteries and characterized by several false positives. Therefore, a refinement strategy is recommended, to make the accuracy of the NMC dataset comparable to that characterizing the NMC results from dataset 1 achieved without any refinement.

Our main goal is to assess whether structural heterogeneity in the context of the urban-rural dichotomy and international borders can explain differences in the regions' engagement in inter-regional innovation cooperation. We estimate a gravity equation to model innovation cooperation, proxied by inter-regional co-patent applications, as a function of region-specific context conditions as well as technological and geographical distance. Our data comprise dyadic information on 203 NUTS2 regions in 15 European countries (EU-15) for the year 2010. The empirical results show that the basic gravity mechanisms drive the direction and strength of innovation cooperation between EU regions; i.e., geographical distance acts as an impediment to inter-regional co-patent applications. Regarding the importance of structural heterogeneity, we find that pairs of rural regions have lower levels of innovation cooperation compared to urban regions. Similarly, border regions are generally disadvantaged compared to non-border regions in terms of the intensity of innovation cooperation. However, while the latter result points to a negative border effect, our gravity model estimates also show that pairs of border regions are more active in terms of close geographical innovation cooperation (e.g., through international cross-border cooperation), which partly compensates for the negative border effect. This finding not only holds for urban but also rural border regions and may reflect policy attempts to support border regions, e.g., by strengthening the level of international cross-border cooperation within the EU.",2020,Geography; Public Administration,1
Legitimising a 'zombie idea': childhood vaccines and autism - the complex tale of two judgments on vaccine injury in Italy,vaccine injury; vaccine liability; vaccine hesitancy; autism; causation; zombie idea; public health; LAW; IMPLEMENTATION; HESITANCY; ANT,"The impact of 'bad' science on judicial decision-making is a thorny aspect of the relationship between science and law. This study employs doctrinal and empirical analysis to explore two Italian judgments that asserted a causal link between childhood vaccines and autism. Using a combination of actor network theory and legal pragmatism, we uncovered a network of actors and institutions internal and external to the legal system enabling these impactful decisions that went on to contribute to a crisis in vaccination coverage in Italy. These include trial strategies, resources, communication practices between arms of government, awareness and responsiveness of institutional actors, and institutional mechanisms governing the integration of scientific expertise into the legal process. By forensically analysing how a 'zombie idea' received a patent of legitimacy in the Italian context, this study provides useful lessons for legal systems grappling with complex and contested public health matters.",2021,Government & Law,1
Regulatory exclusivity protection for undisclosed test data in China: an innovative approach to implementing the TRIPS Agreement,access to medicine; China-US trade disputes; regulatory exclusivities; undisclosed test data; TRIPS Agreement; ,"Regulatory exclusivity, the TRIPS-plus protection for undisclosed test data, is considered as the principal means to extend market protection for brand-name pharmaceutical companies. When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it promised to enact new laws or regulations that will comply with article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement. China's choice of implementing the TRIPS Agreement through regulatory exclusivity resulted mainly from intrinsic demands for China's strategy of innovative-driven development, and partly from the pressure of China-US trade disputes. There are two categories of regulatory exclusivities under China's laws. One is the market exclusivity for New Drugs and Traditional Chinese Medicine. The other is the data exclusivity for Innovative Drugs, Orphan Drugs, Paediatric Drugs, Innovative Biologics; and a 'Generic Exclusivity' for the first generic drug company that succeeds in challenging weak patents of pharmaceutical products.",2020,Government & Law,1
Exploring the role of R&D collaborations and non-patent IP policies in government technology transfer performance: Evidence from US federal agencies (1999-2016),; BAYH-DOLE ACT; UNITED-STATES; PATENT POLICY; DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES; DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; RESEARCH INSTITUTES; TRANSFER OFFICES; GOVERNANCE MODE; UNIVERSITY,"Around the world, governments make substantial investments in public sector research and development (R&D) entities and activities to generate major scientific and technical advances that may catalyze long-term economic growth. Institutions ranging from the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the French National Centre for Scientific Research to the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers conduct basic and applied R&D to create commercially valuable knowledge that supports the innovation goals of their respective government sponsors. Globally, the single largest public sector R&D sponsor is the U.S. federal government. In 2019 alone, the U.S. government allocated over $14.9 billion to federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), also known as national labs. However, little is known about how federal agencies' utilization of FFRDCs, their modes of R&D collaboration, and their adoption of non-patent intellectual property (IP) policies (copyright protection and materials transfer agreements) affect agency-level performance in technology transfer. In particular, the lack of standardized metrics for quantitatively evaluating government entities' effectiveness in managing innovation is a critical unresolved issue. We address this issue by conducting exploratory empirical analyses of federal agencies' innovation management activities using both supply-side (filing ratio, transfer rate, and licensing success rate) and demand-side (licensing income and portfolio exclusivity) outcome metrics. We find economically significant effects of external R&D collaborations and non-patent IP policies on the technology transfer performance of 10 major federal executive branch agencies (fiscal years 1999-2016). We discuss the scholarly, managerial, and policy implications for ongoing and future evaluations of technology transfer at federal labs. We offer new insights and guidance on how critical differences in federal agencies' interpretation and implementation of their R&D management practices in pursuit of their respective missions affect their technology transfer performance outcomes. We generalize key findings to address the broader innovation processes of public sector R&D entities worldwide.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1

We also compared their views with those of other justice stakeholders (N = 210) from the same country (Romania). Judges showed greater endorsement and less variability in views on the use of genetic data and technologies than the other groups. The agreement among the judges was strikingly strong for some controversial issues, including gene editing; patenting of genetic findings; and the State using genetic information for crime prevention. Judges and other lawyers recognized the need for amending the relevant laws.

We use content analysis to identify the efficiency of institutional investors' communication, and find that institutional investors' communication promotes corporate green innovation. The mechanism analysis indicates that institutional investors' communication improves managers' awareness of green transformation, promotes corporate green investment efficiency and mitigates the extent of greenwashing. The positive impacts of institutional investors' communication are more effective on corporate utility patents than on invention patents. Such green governance effects are more pronounced in non-state-owned firms, green investors and close-distance to the institutional investors. By introducing exogenous shocks of the New Environmental Protection Law and China's regional carbon emissions trading market pilots, we find that the impact of institutional investors' communication on green innovation is enhanced after the implementation of environmental policies. Overall, our research contributes to the existing literature on institutional investors' green activism and the factors of green innovation, and also enriches the cross-disciplinary research on environmental regulation affecting institutional investors' green governance.",2024,Business & Economics; International Relations,1

It bridges the legal literature and the economics literature by emphasizing and explaining the information asymmetries in employment relationships regarding the informal IP strategies. NDAs need to be supplemented by CNCs or trade secret law. Enforceable CNCs and trade secrets have a reward function, but trade secrets are more efficient in informal IP management and innovation. Beyond the legal risks imposed by informal IP, companies should actively improve employee loyalty and their security culture through employee management.",2021,Business & Economics; Public Administration,1
THE VALUE IN SECRECY,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; TRADE SECRETS; LAW; INFORMATION; PROTECTION; KNOWLEDGE; ECONOMICS; COPYRIGHT; CONTRACT,"Trade secret law is seen as the most inclusive of intellectual property regimes. So long as information can be kept secret, the wisdom goes, it can be protected under trade secret law, even if patent and copyright protections are unavailable. But keeping it a secret does not magically transform information into a trade secret. The information must also derive economic value from being kept secret from others. This elusive statutory requirement-called independent economic value -might at first glance seem redundant, especially in the context of litigation. After all, if information had no value, why would the plaintiff have bothered to keep it secret, and why would the parties be arguing over the right to use or disclose it? Surely, well-kept secrets that end up in court must be valuable. That assumption is pervasive. But it is wrong. Secrecy does not demonstrate value. Even a company's best-kept secrets might be commercially worthless if vetted against what is known in the rest of the industry. Nor does the decision to pursue litigation indicate value. Trade secret litigants have plenty of exogenous reasons for pursuing lawsuits that have little to do with information's inherent value. Most importantly, value  is not the statutory standard; the standard is economic value that comes specifically from secrecy. Some federal courts have begun to call out weak assertions of independent economic value and, in the process, are redefining the role of this neglected statutory requirement.

As an emerging market of the world, Asian developing countries experience various issues related to intellectual property rights protection. Meanwhile, the current literature on intellectual property rights with an emphasis placed on Asia is quite scarce. Therefore, this study explores the determinants of the strength of intellectual property rights in 25 Asian developing countries during the 11-year period from 2006 to 2016. Using the fixed effects model (FEM) and random effects model (REM) with the Hausman test, the paper discovers the positive impacts of economic growth, trade openness, and WTO participation on the protection level of intellectual property rights. Unexpectedly, education is a negative determinant of intellectual property rights protection. This study aims to demonstrate the overall status quos of intellectual property rights regimes across Asian developing countries, so provide an important theoretical background for innovators, governments, and policymakers to design optimal intellectual property rights strategies.",2023,Business & Economics,1

Yet, market value spillovers stemming from firms' resource bases have received scarce attention in the literature. This article provides evidence of such spillovers in the context of technological acquisitions. I hypothesize that acquisitions act as signals, revealing to investors that the acquired technologies are more valuable than initially expected. These signals should affect firms owning similar technological resources. Measuring technological similarity with the text similarity of firms' patent portfolios, I find that the announcement of an acquisition brings a positive revaluation of firms with technological resources like those of the target. These spillovers also reach firms with a product market focus different from those of the merging firms. Managerial Summary Technological resources are key strategic resources that significantly contribute to firms' valuations. These resources are often acquired through corporate acquisitions. This study explores whether acquisitions affect the valuation of technological resources of other companies not involved in the transaction. The results show that a firm that owns patents similar to the company being acquired experience positive stock market returns at the acquisition announcement, which suggests that the deal signals to investors that the acquired resources are more valuable than initially expected. This effect holds regardless of whether the firm belongs to the same industry as the target or the acquirer. These spillovers change the market value of technological resources and are likely to affect the gains from later acquisitions or divestures of similar resources.",2022,Business & Economics,1

Design/methodology/approach In this study, a longitudinal analysis of European ICT companies was conducted, contrasting internal knowledge creation, in the form of patent accumulation and research and development (R&D) efforts, with external learning through merger-and-acquisition (M&A) activities to uncover the best strategies for performance maximization. Findings Results suggest that the two knowledge generation strategies are not complementary and demonstrate only marginal impact on organizational performance. However, intriguing patterns in combining the two became apparent. It was found that patent accumulation improves learning achieved through M&A activities, while also acting as a protection against corporate takeover. At the same time, the internal knowledge generation strategy was found to have a negative impact on financial performance, with external knowledge generation demonstrating somewhat mixed results. Practical implications This paper provides practical insights into the patterns of internal and external knowledge generation activities. The two strategies were found not to be complementary, implying that companies must carefully choose their preferences. Originality/value This large-scale study tackles the interplay between internal and external knowledge generation strategies, which are mostly studied separately. It reveals new patterns in corporate acquisition and divestment strategies as sources of new knowledge. It also ties the knowledge paradigm to organizational performance.",2020,Business & Economics,1

Taking Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2010 to 2019 as samples, this paper divides environmental regulations into three categories: command-based environmental regulation (ER1), market-based environmental regulation (ER2) and voluntary environmental regulation (ER3), studies their impact on enterprise GTI, and discusses the joint effect of enterprise research and development (R&D) investment and government support from the perspective of internal and external linkage of enterprises. In addition, this paper also analyzes the compound effect and time effect of environmental regulation. The research conclusions are as follows: (1) From the perspective of policy types, both ER1 and ER 2 could stimulate enterprises to carry out GTI, and the promotion effect of green utility model patents is slightly higher than that of green invention patents. ER3 inhibits enterprise GTI. In addition, this paper finds that the effect of three environmental regulations acting at the same time is greater than that of one of them. (2) The mechanism analysis shows that the R&D investment of enterprise positively could moderate the relationship between ER2 and green invention at the significance level of 5%, positively moderate the relationship between ER2 and green utility model patent at the significance level of 1%, and negatively moderate the relationship between ER3 and green utility model patent at the significance level of 5%. The government support could moderate the relationship between environmental regulation and green utility model patents at the significance level of 5% and 10%. (3) The effect analysis shows that the transformation rate of GTI in China needs to be improved. The three environmental regulations could have an effect on enterprise GTI in a short period, and ER1 has the fastest effect. (4) Considering the differences in the level of economic development and resource endowments in various regions of China, this paper classifies the sample enterprises and finds that the impact of environmental regulation on enterprise GTI is heterogeneous in terms of location, ownership nature, factor density and industry type.

Yet, the extant literature has not sufficiently explored the antecedents of their use, in particular within the context of technology acquisitions. In this study, we take advantage of the passage of the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA), which disseminated information through the publication of patent applications, to explore the impact of innovation disclosures on the design of technology acquisition contracts. Consistent with the view that an increase in the availability of information related to the broader technological landscape reduces the need for contractual protections in acquisition contracts, our analysis demonstrates that deals disproportionately affected by AIPA have less expansive MAC clauses and are less likely to feature contingent earnouts. These results provide new evidence linking the use of MAC clauses and earnouts with acquisitions subject to information frictions.",2024,Business & Economics,1

The implementation of the National Key Monitoring Enterprises provides new evidence to assess the effects of vertical monitoring. This study integrates and matches three types of micro databases in China: industrial, pollution, and patent, and constructs firm-level panel data from 2004 to 2010. The empirical evidence shows that the policy reduces the energy use intensity of monitored enterprises by about 10.4% and sulfur dioxide emission intensity by about 23.9%. The mechanism test shows that this effect is achieved by means of energy structure optimization, process innovation, and end-of-pipe treatment, but the effect on total factor productivity is not significant. Among them, the positive impact is stronger for high-profit and emerging firms. Further, we quantify the policy-induced capacity transfer and technology spillovers from monitored enterprises to non-monitored enterprises. In terms of scale, the policy leads to a simultaneous increase in output and pollution emissions of unmonitored firms in the same industry. However, in terms of efficiency, the policy reduces the energy use intensity and pollution emission intensity of enterprises in the same industry.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Implications of California v. Texas for the BPCIA,; ,"The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which stimulates price competition and facilitates access to biological therapies by establishing a regulatory framework and patent resolution mechanism for the launch of biosimilars, was enacted as part of the same legislation that produced the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In California v. Texas, the petitioners have asked the Supreme Court to hold the ACA's individual mandate unconstitutional and rule that the remainder of the ACA-including the BPCIA-is inseverable from the individual mandate and must fall as well. The case thus threatens the BPCIA's existence. But if the Court holds the individual mandate unconstitutional, and even if it concludes that certain health insurance provisions in the ACA are inseverable, the Court should not additionally rule that the BPCIA is inseverable. Statutory text and legislative history make clear that the BPCIA was conceived of and operates as an independent, standalone legislative scheme and unlike much of the ACA, it held broad bipartisan support. The BPCIA was enacted with the ACA only for reasons of convenience.

Can foreign suppliers act as innovation springboards for firms? Evidence from China,Foreign suppliers; Corporate innovation; International knowledge transfer; Uncertain risk; CORPORATE; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; KNOWLEDGE,"This study provides a new approach for measuring supplier characteristics by distinguishing the countries where they are located. Using data of Chinese listed companies, we explore how firms' R&D investment and innovation efficiency (patents and citations) are affected by having foreign suppliers in their top five suppliers. Our findings suggest that foreign suppliers acting as transmitters of international technology increase firms' innovation efficiency based on organizational learning theory. Moreover, a series of uncertainties caused by foreign suppliers encourages firms to invest more in R&D based on strategic growth option theory. Mechanism tests show that foreign suppliers from countries with high innovation capacity and a similar Eastern culture have a greater impact on corporate innovation. Firms conduct more R&D activities to mitigate the uncertainties caused by foreign suppliers when they have insufficient overseas channels to acquire international knowledge and a high degree of dependence on foreign suppliers. These results are consistent with a series of robustness tests after accounting for endogeneity.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Long-Acting Injectable Drugs for HIV-1 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis: Considerations for Africa,long-acting cabotegravir injection; preexposure prophylaxis; HIV-1; Africa; CHALLENGES; ADOPTION; KENYA,"Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest burden of HIV-1 and AIDS. About 39% of all new infections in the world in 2020 were in this region. Oral PrEP was found to be very effective in reducing the risk of HIV-1 transmission. However, its effectiveness is highly dependent on users adhering to the drugs. The availability of long-acting injectable PrEP that eliminates the need for a daily pill may increase PrEP uptake and adherence in people who struggle to adhere to oral PrEP. The USA's FDA approved long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA) for PrEP of HIV-1 in December 2021. In this review, we discussed the implementation challenges to the successful roll-out of CAB-LA in Africa and measures to address these implementation challenges. Some health system-level challenges include the cost of the drug, its refrigeration requirement, and the shortage of healthcare providers trained to administer parenteral medicines. In contrast, client challenges include lack of knowledge, accessibility of the drug, side effects, stigma, and lack of family and community support. These challenges can be addressed by several measures emanating from lessons learned from the successful implementation of ART, oral PrEP, and immunization in the continent. Some steps include advocating for waiving of CAB-LA patent licence, conducting demonstration projects in Africa, promoting the use of renewable energy sources such as solar energy, healthcare provider training, task shifting, community engagement, client education, and implementing adherence promotion strategies.",2022,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,1

Competition and R&D Financing: Evidence From the Biopharmaceutical Industry,; CAPITAL STRUCTURE; AGENCY COSTS; CASH FLOW; INNOVATION; PATENTS; FIRM; BEHAVIOR; GROWTH; MARKET; ENTRY,"The interaction between product market competition, R&D investment, and the financing choices of R&D-intensive firms on the development of innovative products is only partially understood. We hypothesize that as competition increases, R&D-intensive firms will: i) increase R&D investment relative to existing assets in place; ii) carry more cash; and iii) maintain less net debt. Using the Hatch-Waxman Act as an exogenous shock to competition, we provide causal evidence supporting these hypotheses through a differences-in-differences analysis that exploits differences between the biopharma industry and other industries, and heterogeneity within the biopharma industry. We also explore how these changes affect innovative output.",2022,Business & Economics,1

Environmental Preferences and Technological Choices: Is Market Competition Clean or Dirty?,; INDUCED INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; GROWTH,"We investigate the effects of consumers' environmental con-cerns and market competition on firms' decisions to innovate in clean technologies. Agents care about their consumption and environmental footprint; firms pursue greener products to soften price competition. Acting as complements, these forces deter-mine R&D, pollution, and welfare. We test the theory using panel data on patents by 7,060 automobile sector firms in 25 coun-tries, environmental willingness to pay, and competition. As pre-dicted, exposure to prosocial attitudes fosters clean innovation, all the more so where competition is strong. Plausible increases in both together can spur it as much as a large fuel price increase. (JEL D22, L62, O31, O34, Q52, Q53, Q54)",2023,Business & Economics,1
"Digital economy, financing constraints, and corporate innovation",Digital economy; Financing constraints; Corporate innovation; Transmission mechanism; CASH FLOW; INFORMATION; GROWTH,"We build a multi-sector Schumpeterian endogenous growth model that incorporates data as a factor of production, and explore the changes in corporate financing constraints brought about by the digital economy and its impact on corporate innovation. Next, we use data on 3328 A-share listed firms in China for the period from 2011 to 2021 to empirically test our model. The results show that the impact of the digital economy on corporate innovation is positive and significant. After multiple rounds of robustness tests and resolution of endogeneity problems, our conclusion holds. In addition, we find that financial constraints act as a transmission mechanism through which the digital economy promotes corporate innovation. After categorizing patents into in-vention and non-invention patents, we find that the role of the digital economy is more (less) obvious in promoting radical (incremental) innovation. In addition, the role of the digital economy in promoting innovation is stronger for large enterprises than for small and micro en-terprises. In summary, from the perspective of financing constraints, this paper studies the impact of the digital economy on corporate innovation using the endogenous growth model and providing empirical evidence. The results are of great significance to attempt to improve inde-pendent innovation capability and achieve high-quality economic development.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Effects of MaiLiuPian on carotid thrombosis in rats and acute pulmonary embolism in mice and its antithrombotic mechanism,antithrombosis; Chinese medicine; extrinsic and endogenous coagulation system; medicinal food; pharmacology; ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS; MODEL; ANTIPLATELET; SAPONINS,"Mailiupian (MLP) is a new patent functional food that consists of Crataegi Fructus, Notoginseng Radix, and Ginkgo Folium, which was reported to be active in improving the microcirculation based on formulation screening. However, whether it is effective in inhibiting thrombus and its mechanism has not been evaluated. Therefore, in the present study, the models of arterial thrombosis induced by FeCl3 and the models of APE by ADP were established to evaluate the antithrombosis effect of MLP. Results showed that MLP markedly reduced the weight and size of wet thrombosis in FeCl3-induced rats and decreased the recovery time from symptoms of APE mice. MLP was proved to prolong APTT, PT, TT and improve the levels of t-PA and 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) significantly, meanwhile, PAI-1 and TXB2 were reduced apparently. By comparing tail bleeding time, MLP showed antithrombotic effects, but without the risk of bleeding, taking aspirin as a control. Practical applications Our experiments proved that MLP, a new patent health food, acted on both coagulation and fibrinolytic systems and the platelet aggregation to play antithrombosis roles, providing a theoretical basis for applications of MLP in preventing or curing thrombosis diseases.",2022,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Food Science & Technology,1

Employing the unexpected departure of mutual fund managers and the inclusion of the Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 index as identifications, we find that institutional investor networks have a positive impact on firm innovation. Specifically, firms that are hold by well-connected institutional investors are motivated to make R & D investments and receive greater patents than their counterparts. This positive influence is more pronounced for non-SOEs and for firms located in less-developed regions, indicating that institutional investor networks act as information flow facilitator and a value certifier to encourage innovation activities.",2023,Business & Economics,1

This study provides a deeper understanding of this question by developing a balanced framework that considers both licensors (universities) and licensees (companies) in licensing deals. Furthermore, we posit that university prestige affects both a university's ability to conduct non-exclusive licensing and a firm's incentive to obtain an exclusive license, thereby shaping their joint willingness to license (non-)exclusively. We also examine how technology transfer office (TTO) experience and prior collaboration between a university and a firm moderate this relationship. To test the hypotheses, we use a dataset consisting of 6653 licensed patents owned by 117 representative Chinese universities. We find that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between university prestige and the likelihood that two parties choose exclusive licensing. Moreover, the moderating effect of TTO experience is partially supported while that of prior collaboration is fully supported. Our findings generate important implications for the relative social impacts of exclusive and non-exclusive licensing of technology inventions as well as the management of university licensing.",2022,Business & Economics,1

Despite the fact that many studies have been conducted with a focus on technology standards, the ways in which primary actors of standards affect the market are yet to be fully investigated in extant studies. In this study, we investigate the primary actors in technology standardization by carrying out a systematic review and constructing a conceptual framework and concept maps of primary actors. Based on our analysis, we categorize primary actors, according to their roles and timing of engagement in standardization, as follows: Technology producers, standard-setters, regulators, and technology users. We illustrate each actor's detailed actions, motives, and difficulties with concept maps that are structured based on the SAO/P model, in order to elucidate why primary actors participate in standardization and how they act to achieve their goals or resolve difficulties. Based on our findings, we derive implications in terms of the strategic management of standardization activities in the manufacturing industry.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,1
Non-safety Assessments of Genome-Edited Organisms: Should They be Included in Regulation?,Sustainability; Social utility; GMO; Ethical impacts; CRISPR; Norwegian Gene Technology Act; FOOD; FRAMEWORK; POLICY; CRISPR/CAS9; SCIENCE; FUTURE; CROPS,"This article presents and evaluates arguments supporting that an approval procedure for genome-edited organisms for food or feed should include a broad assessment of societal, ethical and environmental concerns; so-called non-safety assessment. The core of analysis is the requirement of the Norwegian Gene Technology Act that the sustainability, ethical and societal impacts of a genetically modified organism should be assessed prior to regulatory approval of the novel products. The article gives an overview how this requirement has been implemented in the regulatory practice, demonstrating that such assessment is feasible and justified. Even in situations where genome-edited organisms are considered comparable to non-modified organisms in terms of risk, the technology may have-in addition to social benefits-negative impacts that warrant assessments of the kind required in the Act. The main reason is the disruptive character of the genome editing technologies due to their potential for novel, ground-breaking solutions in agriculture and aquaculture combined with the economic framework shaped by the patent system. Food is fundamental for a good life, biologically and culturally, which warrants stricter assessment procedures than what is required for other industries, at least in countries like Norway with a strong tradition for national control over agricultural markets and breeding programs.",2020,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Engineering; History & Philosophy of Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Philosophy,1

Few scholars have examined whether and how scientists' motives to engage in commercial activities differ across fields. Similarly, efforts to understand academics' choices have focused on three self-interested motives-recognition, challenge, and money-ignoring the potential role of the desire to have an impact on others. Using panel data for a national sample of over 2,000 academics employed at U.S. institutions, we examine how the four motives are related to commercial activity measured by patenting. We find that all four motives are correlated with patenting, but these relationships differ systematically between the life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering. These field differences are consistent with differences across fields in the rewards from commercial activities as well as in the degree of overlap between traditional and commercializable research, which affects the opportunity costs of time spent away from traditional academic work. We discuss potential implications for policy makers, administrators, and managers as well as for future research on the scientific enterprise.",2020,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,1
Barring Judicial Review,; ACCOUNTABILITY; CRISIS,"Whether judicial review is available is one of the most hotly contested issues in administrative law. Recently, laws that prohibit judicial review have sparked debate in the Medicare, immigration, and patent contexts. These debates are continuing in challenges to the recently created Medicare price negotiation program. Yet despite debates about the removal of judicial review, little is known about how often, and in what contexts, Congress has expressly precluded review. This Article provides new insights about express preclusion by conducting an empirical study of the U.S. Code. It creates an original dataset of laws that expressly preclude judicial review of agency action, which this Article refers to as jjudicial review bars. The findings reveal that express preclusion is a phenomenon: at least 190 statutory provisions expressly bar judicial review of agency actions. This Article then creates a taxonomy of actions barred from review. Most review bars target internal management decisions, such as decisions about how to allocate resources, set priorities, and manage personnel. Because judicial review has traditionally been considered a core tool for overseeing agencies, this Article next investigates alternative oversight tools for actions barred from judicial review. When judicial review is barred, other structures often exist for political oversight, internal supervision, and public participation. Strikingly, review bar statutes often expressly create structures to facilitate such oversight. Alternative oversight structures include requirements to send reports to Congress, establish internal procedures, consult with stakeholders, and publish decisions. Furthermore, many review bars involve government spending programs, which are subject to appropriations oversight. Like judicial review, alternative oversight tools play an important role in promoting democratic values of deliberation, inclusiveness, and public accountability in the administrative state. A recent example at the Patent Office illustrates how the combination of review bars and alternative oversight tools can balance efficient implementation of programs with the need to protect individual interests and democratic values. Given the significance of alternative oversight tools in monitoring agencies, this Article argues that courts should consider the availability of alternative oversight tools when construing review bars, and policymakers should do the same when designing regulatory programs.",2024,Government & Law,1
Molecule Size Doesn't Matter: The Case for Harmonizing Antitrust Treatment of Pay-for-Delay Agreements,; ,"With notoriously the most-expensive drug prices in the world, the United States has failed to use all of the tools in its shed to combat the unending upwards trend. One such important tool is U.S. antitrust law that targets companies that improperly charge monopoly and supracompetitive prices long past their original patent's expiration. Some companies have found a way to game the regulatory approval system by suing would-be generic competitors and then, under the guise of settlement, paying them to delay their market entry - allowing a brand drug manufacturer to maintain their monopoly prices and continue raking in large profits. The Actavis Supreme Court found these agreements involving reverse payments - also known as pay-for-delay - can violate antitrust laws even in light of the existing patents. This Note argues that in an ongoing case, In re Humira that examines reverse payments between biologic drug companies, the district court was right to engage in an Actavis analysis but did so improperly. In re Humira provides a prime opportunity to strengthen and clarify U.S. jurisprudence on reverse payments and market allocations to reduce ambiguity in an evolving pharmaceutical sphere: biologics and biosimilars. This Note further argues that to harmonize the antitrust treatment of pharmaceuticals - small molecule and biologic - both clear judicial standards and legislation are needed. This Note proceeds in four parts. Part II discusses various forms of antitrust abuses that arise in the pharmaceutical sphere and that often accompany reverse payment agreements. It follows with the relevant legal and regulatory backgrounds of small and large molecule drugs. Part III then considers the consequences of lax antitrust scrutiny on pharmaceuticals and finishes with an in-depth examination of the In re Humira litigation. Lastly, Part IV proposes a two-fold solution, legal and legislative, to the problems posed by Actavis's lack of legal clarity. Ultimately, the purpose of this Note is to demonstrate that the way a drug is manufactured, approved, or allowed to compete does not alter the application of antitrust law seeking to rid the market of collusive agreements between rivals.",2021,Government & Law; Social Issues,1
BREEDERS' AND FARMERS' EXCEPTIONS: HOW VALUABLE ARE THEY FOR THE WORLD AND ARE THEY A NECESSITY FOR THE BRICS COUNTRIES?,innovative development; food security; intellectual property; patent law; agriculture; developing countries; ,"These days, the world and every country in it are faced with the task of ensuring food security for people. It's of current interest also for the BRICS countries. The ability to access genetic information and materials for seed production depends on intellectual property regimes. A lack of access to them is a main barrier for contribution in the development of plant varieties. This situation leads to dependence on obtaining hybrid varieties from foreign companies, which poses a threat to food security. It seems that to ensure freedom of research priorities there is a need to provide an opportunity to commercialize new breeding achievements resulting from such discoveries. Correct policymaking also includes the issue of regulating the situation when a patent and a certificate of ownership of the new plant variety are issued to different persons or companies. Capturing in legislation the breeders' exception is necessary for the use of the patented invention in the frame of creating, discovering and developing a new plant variety. The biodiversity of seeds is a high stakes matter especially for the developing countries, where there are many challenges for smallholder farmers. The guarantee of the farmers' right to use the saved seeds on their own farms and to exchange such seeds between themselves may be one of the aspects of food security as it is a base of the traditional agriculture economy in some countries, where smallholder farmers play a significant agricultural role. Also the position and scope of farmers' rights and privileges, based on legislation and, especially, on judicial cases, shows a side of independence on international corporations in the agricultural sector.",2020,Government & Law,1
"The timing of 30-month stay expirations and generic entry: A cohort study of first generics, 2013-2020",; MARKET EXCLUSIVITY; LIFE,"Before the first generic version of a drug is marketed, patent litigation often occurs. The process begins when generic manufacturers notify the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of their intent to market a generic copy of a brand-name drug protected by patents, which they allege to be invalid or not infringed (called a Paragraph IV certification). Assuming the brand-name manufacturer responds with litigation within 45 days, a 30-month stay period is triggered, which bars the FDA from authorizing generic entry until the stay period expires or litigation is resolved in favor of the generic manufacturer. To understand whether 30-month stays delay generic entry, we examined the timing of major legal events leading to generic entry for a cohort of 46 generic drugs, including the timing of Paragraph IV certification filings, stay period expirations, the FDA approvals of generics, and generic product launches. We found Paragraph IV certifications were filed a median of 5.2 years after the brand drug's FDA approval. There was a median of 3.2 years between the stay period expiration and subsequent generic launch. Because stay periods generally expire well in advance of when generic entry typically occurs, 30-month stays are unlikely to delay the timing of generic entry. Patent litigation could begin even earlier, however, if litigation was allowed to start immediately following a brand-name drug's FDA approval; but by law currently, the soonest this can begin is 4 years after the brand drug's FDA approval. Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? Before generic versions of new drugs reach the market, patent litigation often occurs. Once litigation has been initiated, a 30-month regulatory stay period is triggered that bars the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from approving the generic application until litigation resolves or the stay period expires. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? What is the timing of key legal events in the regulatory approval process for generic drugs in relation to the eventual launch of the generic product? WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? We identified the typical timing of the initiation of patent litigation and expiration of the 30-month stay period prior to the eventual launch of generic products. Litigation is often initiated as soon as legally possible (i.e., 4 years after the launch of the brand product), and stay periods typically expire well before generic entry occurs. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? Stay periods are unlikely to delay generic entry directly because stay expirations often occur well before the time of generic launch. Allowing the submission of generic drug applications immediately following a brand drug's FDA approval would facilitate earlier patent dispute resolution and prevent unnecessary delays in the anticipated generic product launch date.",2021,Research & Experimental Medicine,1
The impact of the private sector co-payment mechanism (PSCM) on the private market for ACT in Nigeria: results of the 2018 cross-sectional outlet and household market surveys,Private sector healthcare; Case management; Health economics; Malaria control; Informal health workers; Private sector engagement; Targeted subsidy; Artemisinin-based combination therapy; Private sector co-payment mechanism; MALARIA; PREQUALIFICATION; GHANA,"Background The private sector plays a large role in malaria treatment provision in Nigeria. To improve access to, and affordability of, quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapy (QA-ACT) within this sector, the Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria began operations in 2010 and transitioned to a private sector co-payment mechanism (PSCM) until 2017. To assess the impact of the scheme on the ACT market, cross-sectional household and outlet surveys were conducted in 2018 to coincide with the final stockages of ACT medicines procured under the PSCM. Methods An outlet survey was conducted targeting private pharmacies and Proprietary and Patent Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) across different regions of Nigeria to assess supply-side market factors related to availability and cost of anti-malarials, including artemisinin-based combinations subsidised under the PSCM (called green leaf ACT on account of their green leaf logo) and those not subsidised (non-green leaf ACT). A concurrent household survey was conducted to determine demand-side factors related to treatment-seeking practices, ACT brand preference and purchase decision. Data were compared with previous ACTWatch surveys to consider change over time. Results Availability of artemisinin-based combinations increased significantly over the PSCM period and was almost universal by the time of the 2018 market survey. This increase was seen particularly among PPMVs. While the cost of green leaf ACT remained relatively stable over time, the cost of non-green leaf ACT reduced significantly so that by 2018 they had equivalent affordability. Unsubsidised brands were also available in different formulations and dosages, with double-strength artemisinin-based combination reported as the most frequently purchased dosage type, and child artemisinin-based combinations popular in suspension and dispersible forms (forms not subsidised by the PSCM). Conclusions The PSCM had a clear impact on increasing not only the reach of subsidized QA brands, but also of non-subsidised brands. Increased market competition led to innovation from unsubsidised brands and large reductions in costs to make them competitive with subsidised brands. Concerns are drawn from the large market share that non-QA brands have managed to gain as well as the continued market share of oral artemisinin monotherapies. Continued monitoring of the market is recommended, along with improved local capacity for QA-certification and monitoring.",2022,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,1

Antithrombotic and antiplatelet treatment before PCI may affect outcomes at vascular access sites. QuikClot Radial is a kaolin-based band that may shorten hemostasis time. Using point-of-care testing, we investigated the effect of antithrombotic and antiplatelet treatment on access-site complications. Methods This prospective observational study included consecutive patients with CCS on chronic aspirin therapy referred for ad hoc PCI. The activated clotting time (ACT), global thrombosis test and VerifyNow P2Y12 test were done sequentially after unfractionated heparin (UFH) and clopidogrel administration. Patients were monitored for radial artery patency, bleeding and local hematoma until discharge. Results We enrolled 40 patients [mean age, 68.8 +/- 8.8 years; men, 30 (75%)] who received UFH (median dose, 8000 IU; interquartile range, 7000-9000 IU) and clopidogrel (600 mg). All radial arteries remained patent during follow-up. Local bleeding and hematomas were noted in 11 patients (27.5%) each. Patients with bleeding had lower mean platelet activity at 2 h [122.5 +/- 51 platelet reactivity units (PRU) vs. 158.7 +/- 43 PRU, P = 0.04] and higher ACT (216.9 +/- 40 s vs. 184.6 +/- 28 s, P = 0.006) than patients without bleeding. An ACT >196 s at 2 h predicted bleeding or hematoma (AUC, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.85, P = 0.008). Conclusion Lower platelet activity and higher ACT after PCI were associated with higher bleeding risk at a vascular access site. Point-of-care testing of ACT after the procedure may help identify patients with CCS undergoing PCI who are at higher risk of access-site bleeding.",2024,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,1

A novel deep learning-based methodology is proposed to investigate S&T linkages, where papers and patents are applied to represent science and technology. In order to accurately and comprehensively reveal the linkages between science and technology topics, the proposed framework combines the information of knowledge structure with textual semantics. Furthermore, the exploration analysis is also conducted from the perspective of realizing the optimal matching between science and technology topics, which can realize combinatorial optimization of the S&T knowledge systems. Specifically, science and technology networks are constructed based on Node2Vec and BERT. Then, science and technology topics are identified based on the Fast Unfolding algorithm and Z Score index. Finally, a science-technology bipartite graph is constructed, the S&T topic linkages identification task is successfully transferred into a bipartite matching problem, and the maximum-weight matching is identified using a Kuhn-Munkres bipartite algorithm.

The sustainable development goals: Theory and a holistic evidence from the USA,SDGs; United Nations; Sustainability; Efficiency of SDG policies; Energy Policy Act; America Invents Act; RENEWABLE ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; IMPACT,"This study emphasizes a crucial consideration for policymakers working towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as social welfare, environmental sustainability, democratic governance, fair income distribution, and other related goals. Policymakers need to account for the characteristics of series associated with these goals, specifically their stationarity or the presence of unit roots; the reason is that these characteristics have a significant impact on the success of the policies. Notably, policies relying on unit root series may result in costly and time-consuming efforts to achieve the targeted SDGs. This study investigates interactions between seventeen SDGs for the USA with a holistic approach between 1960-2022. This investigation employs the FWADF, FWKSS, and Bai-Perron tests for seventeen selected representative variables (series) of the SDGs. Finally, it presents and discusses the main policy implications of the empirical findings for seven series (variables) containing unit roots. The findings of this study have necessary implications for policymakers and the achievement of the USA's SDGs. One of the empirical findings of this study is that the Energy Policy Act enacted in 2003 encouraged more significant development and use of clean and renewable energy, denoting SDG7 in the USA. Another finding is that contrary to expectations, there was no significant increase in the number of patents denoting SDG9 after the America Invents Act came into force in 2013.

The comprehensive analysis of these international rules and their effect provides valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between domestic and international factors in shaping health policies. Building upon the IP case, we categorize existing scholarship on global lawmaking into three methodological approaches: (a) methodological internationalism, (b) methodological nationalism, and (c) the interplay between domestic and international factors. We close with a call for researchers to advocate and integrate into their methods a co-constitutive approach that considers the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements.",2023,Government & Law; Sociology,1
Has the EU Incentive for Drug Repositioning Been Effective? An Empirical Analysis of the +1 Regulatory Exclusivity,Drug repositioning; Regulatory exclusivities; Patents; Empirical study; Intellectual property; INNOVATION; PRICE,"EU law incentivises drug marketing authorisation holders (MAHs) to find new uses for their compounds (research known as repositioning) by offering them an extra year of market protection if the new use is authorised. This extra year, known as the +1, was enacted on limited evidence, and no study has examined its effect since it began. Yet, several leading commentators suggest lengthening the +1. This study assesses the effectiveness of the +1 by analysing all the relevant instances of MAHs repositioning their drugs before and after the +1 came into effect. The results show that: (i) 42.2% of MAHs repositioned their drugs before the +1 came into effect, and (ii) once the +1 did come into effect, it did not increase the percentage of MAHs that repositioned their drugs. This study finds that the +1 failed to increase repositioning and then proceeds to consider reform options, including repealing the law. In doing so, this study takes the first steps towards an evidence-based policy for the topic.",2021,Government & Law,1

Exploiting unique data on business-related home equity loans in Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, I show that stress-tested banks strongly cut small business loans secured by home equity, an important source of financing for entrepreneurs. Lower credit supply leads to a relative decline in entrepreneurship in counties with higher exposure to stress-tested banks. The decline is stronger in sectors with a higher share of young firms using home equity financing, that is, in which the reduction in credit hits hardest. More-exposed counties also see a decline in young firms' patent applications as well as labor productivity, reflecting young firms' disproportionate contribution to growth.",2021,Business & Economics,1

Why and How ITRS Worked to Recover the Breakdown of Scaling Law in 2000s-Structural Frame Analysis of Si-CMOS Semiconductor Technologies,Transistors; Manufacturing; Patents; Electric breakdown; Electronics industry; Silicon; (Dennard' s) Scaling Law; ITRS (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors); Moore' s Law; planar technology; semiconductor; Si-CMOS; technology roadmap; ,"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) is referred to as one of the most successful roadmapping attempts in high-tech industries. ITRS constantly gave orientation to industries (device/equipment/materials), academia, and governments for continuing miniaturization. The 2000s, the period of utmost attention to ITRS, is also the period of gradual breakdown of Dennard's Scaling Law which stipulates the technological merits attained by miniaturization of Si-CMOS semiconductors: 1) shrink in chip size; 2) lowered power consumption, and 3) boosted computation speed, simultaneously. The author discusses that ITRS of 2000s had worked for recovering the breakdown of the Law and that it is attributed to the highly structured nature of Si-CMOS semiconductor technologies in a frame of (manufacturing) process-device structure-function. Then, he evaluates the validity of the hypothesis by analyzing wide range of technologies newly introduced in 2000s, namely 1) variety of supplementary methods for prolonging the life of Argon Fluoride Laser lithography; 2) high-k dielectric membranes and metal gate for reducing gate-leak current; and 3) low-k dielectric membranes and strained-silicon transistors to boost computation speed. Thus, the author concludes that 1) ITRS at least functioned to let the consensus (among early adopters) be established in wide range of research community; 2) under the gradual breakdown of Dennard's Scaling Law in 2000s, ITRS worked to keep the Si-CMOS semiconductor's killing-three-birds-with-one-stone nature; and 3) the success of ITRS in 2000s is attributed to the structural frame of Si-CMOS semiconductor technologies characterized as fixed-in-total and disruptive-in-parts.",2021,Business & Economics; Engineering,1

The paper demonstrates this statement through an empirical analysis based on an original large-scale patent database covering the creation of all 4.0 technologies across all European NUTS-2 regions in the period 2000-15. Regions exist in Europe characterized by a 4.0 technological leadership achieved in the absence of a strong pre-existing 3.0 technological base.

The baseline result shows that inflexibility is positively associated with innovation activities. In the mechanism analyses, we find that the positive relationship is mainly driven by firms with higher contraction inflexibility and in less stable external environments. The positive relationship is also stronger for firms in industries with higher concentration, and in economies with stronger creditor rights. Finally, we observe a weaker relationship in multinational enterprises. Collectively, our findings suggest that scale inflexibility creates a stable environment for corporate innovation.",2022,Business & Economics,1

Evidence from the United States,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PUBLIC CORRUPTION; CONNECTED BOARDS; CORPORATE; ALLOCATION; GOVERNANCE; LAWS; MARKETS; FINANCE; IMPACT,"We examine how local political corruption affects firm innovation in the United States. We find that firms located in highly corrupt areas are less innovative as measured by their patenting activities. The results are robust to the inclusion of a broad set of regional characteristics, instrumental variable analysis, matching analysis, difference-in-differences test, and alternative proxies for local corruption. Further analysis shows that reduced innovation incentives due to high extortion risk and decreased threat of competition could be the possible economic channels through which corruption affects innovation. Overall, our results indicate that local political corruption impedes corporate innovation in the United States.",2021,Business & Economics,1

Thus, the originator company can pro-long its exclusivity, with a probability of monopoly power. Although they give a financial compensation for the contracting generic companies, this agreement is detrimental for the government and for the patients. They need to pay for the more expensive branded drug, nevertheless, the patent is not valid anymore.

TRIPS and the right to human health: A case study on Brazil's health policies and its implications,AIDS treatment; compulsory licensing; Doha Declaration; healthcare rights; intellectual property; key topics; TRIPS Agreement; ,"The incorporation of intellectual property laws in Brazil, by drafting or amending laws, as a result of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, has been a subject of political and social debate. The ambiguity of the Agreement's effects explains the Brazilian government's reluctance to address the issue, particularly concerning public health policies, as it presents a conflict between healthcare rights and intellectual property protection. The country had utilized compulsory licensing of an antiretroviral drug for AIDS treatment under Decree No. 6,108/2007. This precedent has sparked discussions about future cases of selective incorporation of compulsory licensing as a national prerogative, aiming to ensure that the patent system upholds the country's right to protect public health and promote access to medicines, in accordance with The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement. Nevertheless, such a pattern could undermine innovation and discourage private-sector investment and research, which is predominantly conducted by developed countries.",2024,Government & Law,1

Do firms' performance act as a catalyst of innovation: empirical evidence from innovative Indian manufacturing firms,Innovation; Firm-performance; Negative binomial; GMM; C13; C35; L25; O03; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; EMBODIED TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; PANEL-DATA; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; BUSINESS GROUPS; PRODUCTIVITY; PATENTS; IMPACT; CLUSTERS,"PurposeThis paper aims to explore whether firms' performance determines innovation using a sample of Indian manufacturing firms. The impact of innovation on firms' performance across specific countries has been discussed in the literature. However, the effect of firms' performance on innovation output, especially for a developing country like India, remains an open question. Against this backdrop, this paper investigates whether firms' performance determines innovation in Indian manufacturing firms.Design/methodology/approachThe authors use patent filing information to instrument innovation and total factor productivity to instrument firms' performance. The patent data are collected from the Patent Search and Analysis Software database and firm-level data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy's Prowess database. The study uses a sample of 309 Indian manufacturing firms from 2005 to 2021. Given the count nature of the data set used in this study coupled with over-dispersion issues, the authors have used the negative binomial regression to estimate the empirical specification of the models. There could be a possible problem of endogeneity due to the contemporary nature of innovation and firms' performance. Therefore, to address the possible issues of endogeneity in the model, the authors have used the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators for more robustness checks of the empirical results.FindingsThe empirical results exhibit a positive and significant impact of firms' performance on the innovation output, validating that firms' performance determines innovation in Indian manufacturing firms. The posterior estimation results using GMM estimation also corroborate that firms' productivity is a determining factor for the innovation output of Indian manufacturing firms. Furthermore, empirical results exhibit that the ex ante innovativeness of the firms substantially affects the current innovation. This validates that the firms' prior experience, learning by doing and past innovative efforts are more likely to precipitate more innovation in the current period.Originality/valueThis paper's main contribution is empirically estimating whether firms' performance determines innovation, which is hardly discussed in the existing innovation literature, specifically using Indian manufacturing industries. Further, it adds to the existing literature in two other prominent ways. First, this paper investigates whether firms require ex ante expertise to innovate or if a firm starting from scratch can innovate significantly without any hindrances. Second, it enriches the literature by instrumenting innovation in output terms with the patent application against input measures of innovation, such as research and development expenditures, acquisition of machinery and equipment, while discussing the relationship between firms' performance and innovation, specifically in the context of a developing economy like India.",2024,Development Studies,1

We provide evidence that young life-cycle firms are particularly vulnerable to negative innovation consequences from financial regulation but do not appear to experience any compensating financial reporting quality (FRQ) benefits. Using a generalized difference-in-differences design around Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), we document a significant reduction in both research and development (R&D) spending and innovation outputs for young life-cycle stage firms after regulation. Declines in innovation manifest both from the diversion of scarce resources and from the imposition of an organizational culture mismatched to the pursuit of explorative innovation, resulting in a less generalizable and less diversified patent portfolio. However, we find no evidence that improvements to FRQ materialize to offset these costs. Event study analyses suggest that this negative impact was expected by market participants, and postregulation returns confirm this expectation.",2022,Business & Economics,1

Institutional investors play a crucial role in a firm's operation and exert considerable influence on the efficient monitoring of innovative investment. Theory predicts that institutional ownership has a positive effect on innovation investment. However, we find that active institutional investors drove this positive relationship. For those passive institutional investors, this impact is negative. However, a banker on the board can change the effect from negative to positive for passive institutional investors. Firms with female directors, a high presence of audit committee, or a large proportion of ethnic minority directors on board have a significant and positive impact on innovation, including R&D investments and the number of patents. The enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002 made information more transparent to investors and narrowed the gap between active and passive institutional investors on innovation. The findings are robust to addressing endogeneity concerns and causal relationships using the IV-2SLS, Difference-in-Differences approaches, and alternative methodology.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Regional Happiness and Corporate Green Innovation: A Financing Constraints Perspective,regional happiness; financing constraints; informal institutions; green innovation; PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; LIFE SATISFACTION; DRIVING FORCES; ECO-INNOVATION; SELF-IMAGE; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; VALUES,"In China's period of economic transition, enterprises often find it difficult to obtain the support of formal institutions and the capital market, so informal institutions such as value and social networks are particularly important resources. Regional happiness can influence corporate green innovation by shaping the external environment. This study takes a sample of Chinese A-listed companies and empirically tests the impact of regional happiness on corporate green innovation by constructing happiness data at a city level. The empirical results show that in cities with high levels of happiness, the green innovation level of listed companies is higher. This is manifested by a higher number of green patents and green invention patent applications. To test for reliability, a series of robustness tests were carried out. First, we performed 2SLS regression using the instrumental variable method in consideration of the possibility of a reverse generation of endogenous problems. Second, we remeasured corporate green innovation using a green patent authorization considering the rationality and applicability of the measurement method of core variables, and then remeasured the regional happiness based on a text analysis of social media content. Both tests showed that the conclusions are robust. Mechanism analysis revealed that regional happiness has an impact on corporate green innovation through financing constraints, namely, that it can either alleviate enterprises' financing constraints, or substitute for regional financial development to promote corporate green innovation. Further analysis showed that, for enterprises lacking political connections, regional happiness plays a significant role in promoting green innovation. This indicates that, in the absence of financing convenience, the resource effect brought by regional happiness acts as a substitute for an implicit government guarantee. This study provides new insights into the determinants of corporate green innovation and the value of informal institutions in environmental sustainability.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

Some of these are familiar issues that have long been understood but not acted upon effectively - for example, the danger that current systems of intellectual property and patent protection are actually inimical to delivering a cost-effective vaccine available to all, whereas treating knowledge as a commons and a public good is much more likely to deliver efficient outcomes for the entire global population. But COVID-19 has also demonstrated that traditional models of knowledge production and dissemination are failing us; scientific knowledge is becoming weaponized and hyper-partisan, and confidence in this knowledge is falling. We believe that the challenges that COVID-19 has exposed in the information economy and ecology will be of increasing applicability across the whole spectrum of sustainability; sustainability scholars and policymakers need to understand and grasp them now if we are to avoid contagion into other sectors due to the preventable errors that have marred the global response to COVID-19.

Effects of incorporating public innovation intermediaries on technology transfer performance: evidence from patent licensing of Japan's Kohsetsushi,Incentive system; Innovation intermediaries; Intellectual property; Japan; Patent licensing; Regional innovation systems; Unintended consequence; BAYH-DOLE ACT; UNIVERSITIES; SYSTEM; INCENTIVES; GROWTH; IMPACT; POLICY,"The incorporation of public organizations is meant to improve their efficiency and contribution to national and local economies. In Japan, incorporation has been implemented at the national and local levels since the late 1990s. This process alters the incentive system comprising intellectual property (IP) ownership, managerial freedom, and rent sharing, which promotes IP commercialization. This study assesses the economic consequences of the incentive system reform, taking the example of a public innovation intermediary, Kohsetsushi. Unlike the incorporation of national universities, the incorporation of Kohsetsushi is at the discretion of local governments. Therefore, there should be a comparative advantage for both incorporated and unincorporated Kohsetsushi. A dataset representative of both types of Kohsetsushi was established to estimate the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT), identify the type of selection into incorporation, and discuss the economic consequences of endogenous selection by local governments. The counterfactual analysis of licensing income revealed a negative ATT of incorporation and negative selection into not choosing incorporation. Incorporated Kohsetsushi would have had higher licensing income had they not been incorporated. The evidence does not support comparative advantage. The unintended consequence might have been caused by the lack of harmonization between the incentive and evaluation systems.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Stronger and more just? Recent reforms of China's intellectual property rights system and their implications,Intellectual property rights; China; Reform; Innovation; Technology transfer; ,"PurposeSince 2015, China has made efforts to reform its intellectual property rights (IPR) system to better protect and stimulate innovation. These reforms are a result of the demand for more stringent intellectual property (IP) protection from China's domestic, innovative industries and a measure to ease the pressure exerted by its foreign trading partners, particularly against the background of the US-China trade dispute that started at the beginning of 2018. This paper summarizes these reforms and their implications.Design/methodology/approachThis paper combines a variety of sources, including academic articles, government websites, news reports, industry surveys and expert opinions, to offer insights in China's IPR system and its recent reforms.FindingsThis paper summarizes and discusses (1) the state's law amendments, including the 2015 amendment of the Law on Promoting the Transformation of Scientific and Technological Achievements, the second amendment of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law with regard to trade secret protection, the fourth amendment of the Patent Law, and the legislations and regulations addressing the criticisms of the US administration over China's so-called forced technology transfer policies; (2) the establishment of the specialized IP courts and tribunals since 2014; (3) the restructuring of the State IP Office; and (4) the issuing of an Outline for Building an IPR Powerhouse (2021-2035).Originality/valueThis paper highlights China's efforts to make its IPR system stronger and more just.

Intellectual Property and Tabletop Games,; PIRACY PARADOX; TRADE SECRETS; LAW; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; SEARCH; NORMS,"There is a rich body of literature regarding intellectual property's (IP) negative spaces-fields where creation and innovation thrive without significant formal protection from IP law. Scholars have written about innovation in diverse fields despite weak or nonexistent IP rights, such as fashion design, fine cuisine, stand-up comedy, magic tricks, tattoos, and sports plays. Instead, these fields rely on social norms, first-mover advantage, and other (non IP)legal regimes to promote innovation in the absence of IP protection. As a comparison to these studies, this Article comprehensively analyzes the role of IP law in facilitating innovation in tabletop gaming, including board games, card games, and pen-and-paper role-playing games. Over the past several decades, the tabletop gaming industry has seen a proliferation of innovation, but there is surprisingly little in the academic literature about IP and tabletop games. IP rights, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, each protect certain aspects of games, while at the same time being constrained by doctrinal limitations that leave considerable flexibility for others to develop their own games and adapt or improve upon existing ones. There are also numerous examples of user-based innovation in tabletop gaming. This Article concludes by contending that IP rights, as well as their limitations, play a significant role in facilitating the robust innovation presently occurring in the tabletop gaming field.",2022,Government & Law,1

We theorize that companies can use social structures-shared educational and professional affiliations-between lawyers and judges to strategically pursue specific legal jurisdictions, influence judges' discretion, and ultimately reap different legal outcomes from the same legal environment. Using data on such affiliations between lawyers and federal judges, we examine companies' choice of U.S. federal district courts and their legal outcomes in patent infringement litigation from 1990 to 2013. Our results reveal that companies strategically pursue courts in which their lawyers have past educational or professional affiliations with the courts' judges. If a desired judge is assigned to the case, a company leverages its lawyers' social structures to tailor any legal communication to match that judge's style. While such behavior results in a higher likelihood of winning a lawsuit, it also creates an inherent risk. In stacking their legal teams with lawyers who have connections to judges, companies often shortchange the human capital-lawyers' skillsets-required to win a case, which adversely affects legal outcomes if the desired judge is not assigned to the case.",2021,Business & Economics,1

While the obvious constitution design issues surround how rights enumeration affects the relationship between a government and its citizens, we instead analyze how rights framing impacts how citizens interact with each other. We design and implement a novel experiment to test whether social cooperation depends on the enumeration and positive or negative framing of the right of subjects to take a particular action. We find that when rights are framed positively, there exists an 'entitlement effect' that reduces social cooperation levels and crowds-out the tendency of individuals to act pro-socially.",2023,Business & Economics; Government & Law,1

In particular, WIPO's international intellectual property (IP) treaties have done much to bridge the territorial nature of IP with the business needs of innovators and brand owners who operate in an interconnected global economy. They also vividly illustrate the benefits of multilateral cooperation: IP can flow from anywhere to everywhere, thus requiring a truly global approach toward cooperation. Here, we explain some of the practical benefits of WIPO's Patent Cooperation Treaty, Madrid, and Hague Systems, especially over the last 25 years.

However, there is less consensus about the factors that cause high-tech exports to thrive. Most studies emphasize the crucial role played by research and development expenditures, foreign direct investments, trade openness, human capital, and patents. In this article, we instead examine the role of a different determinant, which usually is overlooked in the scholarly debate about governance institutions. We use government effectives (GE) and rule of law (ROL) as measures of governance. We employ a panel-data approach encompassing more than 100 countries between 2007 and 2019.

Trade Secrets: Promoting Innovation in Biosimilars,; APPROVAL; COMPETITION; PROTECTION; ECONOMICS; PATENTS; GUIDE; LAW,"Trade secrets are generally considered as stifling innovation, including the innovation of biosimilars. This article considers the alternative and suggests that trade secrets over biologics not only promote, but actually force biosimilar innovation. Specifically, trade secrets encourage biosimilars to innovate in two areas: process design and analytical science. Both areas of innovation are related to the unique nature of biologics and biosimilars and their molecular size, complexity and heterogeneity. However, it is not enough to say that the secret nature of originator manufacturing processes promotes innovation. This article will show that biosimilars may not only innovate in the sense of allowing cumulative innovation in analytical techniques for biopharmaceutical characterisation, but originator trade secrets also promote a different kind of innovation in biosimilar development processes: simultaneous innovation.",2021,Government & Law,1

The hypothesis ascertains that stringent regulation may not hamper the innovative process but instead promote it by producing more efficient and less-pollutant products and processes. The study constructs three indexes of SD; genuine saving, ecological footprint, and pollution-sensitive Human Development Index. For innovation, the study proxies with the patent application, trademark application, and research and development expenditure (R&D). The intellectual property rights index measures the strength of IPR in a country. The individual estimation among the countries' lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income categories establishes the significant role of R&D on SD irrespective of index and country's classification. The results, however, produce mixed evidence of the impact of other innovation variables on SD. The U-shaped relationship between IPR and SD indicates the immediate negative and long-run positive impact of IPR on SD.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Collaborative innovation relationship in Yangtze River Delta of China: Subjects collaboration and spatial correlation,Regional innovation; Triple helix; Yangtze river delta; Subjects collaboration; Spatial correlation; TRIPLE-HELIX; MUTUAL INFORMATION; PERSPECTIVE; INDICATOR; NETWORKS; SYNERGY; SYSTEMS,"In the regional innovation system (RIS), the triple helix (TH) relations of university, industry, government (UIG) have received wide attention, but the spatial correlation involving various innovation subjects has rarely been deeply analyzed, especially in urban agglomeration. Based on the triple helix perspective, this paper integrates the collaborative coupling relationship between innovation subjects and the spatial correlation between regions in the RIS under a theoretical framework. Two types of collaborative innovation networks are constructed: one is the collaborative coupling network between UIG, one is the spatial correlation network between different areas. Using the invention patent data of provinces in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) from 2014 to 2018, and on account of the TH algorithm based on mutual information, to explore the collaborative innovation relationship from the two dimensions of collaborative coupling among innovation subjects and spatial correlation among regions. The results show that:(1) Jiangsu has an obvious leading advantage in the total amount of invention patents, Zhejiang and Anhui have witnessed a rapid growth of patent output. (2) In the YRD region, the collaboration between university and industry is the closest, the UIG collaborative relationship is close in Shanghai, the collaborative relationship between industry and university in Jiangsu is close. (3) The bilateral correlation between Jiangsu and the other three provinces is relatively strong; the bilateral correlation between Zhejiang and the other three provinces tends to be close. The trilateral correlation among Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is relatively close. This study expands the application fields of the TH theory and provides a new perspective and method for RIS research. The research results offer helpful theoretical support and policy inspiration for accurately grasping the development law of the regional innovation in the YRD and coordinating the relationship between different subjects and different regions in the innovation network.",2022,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Balancing community rights and national interests in international protection of traditional knowledge: a study of India's Traditional Knowledge Digital Library,Intellectual property rights; patent law; traditional knowledge; WIPO; India; Traditional Knowledge Digital Library; REFORMULATION REGIME; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; GOVERNMENT; PATENTS; IGC; IP,"This article analyses how local, national and international interests are reflected in India's attempts to protect traditional knowledge through the formation of a Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL). It compares how the digital library is contextualised within India's domestic policy with how it is presented to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The article argues that WIPO has endorsed the Indian initiative and embraced the promotion of protective databases as an uncontroversial tool that diverts attention from more contested forms of traditional knowledge protection. Consequently, India has been able to use WIPO as a platform to promote itself and the TKDL to the global community. Domestically, however, the library serves other purposes. Since it systematically documents a vast body of traditional medical knowledge, Indian authorities can use the library to claim that knowedge as part of a national cultural heritage, and as a source of scientific innovations to the economic and social benefit of the country. In that regard, the TKDL reflects an interplay among local, national and international interests, where the goal of protecting the traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities against misappropriation risks being co-opted to serve national purposes.",2022,Development Studies,1
New Regulations on Medical Devices in Europe: Are They an Opportunity for Growth?,medical device industry; innovation; patent analysis; regulatory; market potential; INDUSTRY; RISK,"Increasing demand for modern treatments and significant profit margins are strong incentives for investors and producers. However, the production and use of medical devices is subject to a number of laws, regulations, strict standards, and certification processes. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze patent activity based on the example of the selected country (Czech Republic), compare it with selected foreign countries, and discuss the development of this industry in the context of new medical device regulation (MDR) implementation. The paper is based on the theoretical concept of the relationship between regulation and innovation. The main challenge in the implementation of the new medical device regulations lies in the area of innovation. This is because most innovative research in the medical device sector is undertaken by small to medium enterprises (SMEs) rather than by large companies. SMEs are more vulnerable than big companies when it comes to development because the accompanying administrative costs can be so high that it may force the company to leave the market. Given that the main reason for the existence of economic regulations are various forms of market failure, which occurs when market mechanisms do not lead to results that benefit society, any attempts to redress this situation should naturally lead to greater benefits for society and hence benefits for the given industry as well.",2020,Business & Economics,1
Navigating intellectual property challenges in China: Insights from RCEP and domestic factors,; PATENT; PERSPECTIVE; RIGHTS; LAW,"In a high-quality economic era, China needs innovative development. Intellectual property (IP) innovation and development are the first driving forces in China. At the same time, China has signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement (RCEP), which has had a significant impact on the development of China's IP law. Under the combination of these two factors, China's IP innovation and development environment are worth studying. This paper uses the factor analysis method from five dimensions, including initiatives for civic awareness, regional IP development foundation, legislative support, law enforcement measures, and judicial protection, to study the development environment of IP innovation in 31 provincial regions in China, in the past 3 years. It is found that IP development in various regions of China is insufficient in some way, and the scores of different provinces vary greatly, so it will inevitably affect the development of China's IP integrally and then affect the construction process of strong provinces and cities with intellectual property rights (IPR). The novelty of this research is its in-depth investigation into how the RCEP and global partnerships are influencing the transformation of China's intellectual property landscape. This transformation requires legal adjustments and underscores the importance of specialized IP judge training, alignment with international norms, and regional IP progress to realize China's ambition of becoming a dominant force in intellectual property. Combined with the fact that RCEP has come into effect in China and has had a significant impact, it is necessary to develop China's IP undertaking from legislative, judicial, law enforcement, and international cooperation aspects.",2024,Business & Economics,1
"The Laws of Knowledge, Knowledge of Laws A Political Epistemology Perspective on Pistor's The Code of Capital",capital; political epistemology; democratic professionalism; ,"This commentary, part of the book symposium on Katharina Pistor's The Code of Capital, focuses in particular on the epistemic dimensions of the phenomena she describes. Knowledge can be coded as capital, through intellectual property rights, and these can be done in ways that unjustly favor privileged actors at the cost of the common good, as Pistor demonstrates with regard to the patenting of genetic markers. Interestingly, however, knowledge can also be appropriated without the use of legal tools, simply by appropriating data from consumers, as Zuboff, for example, has argued. A second epistemic dimension of Pistor's work lies in the fact that the legal coding of capital is itself little know and receives little public discussion. This, of course, plays into the hands of those who benefit by problematic forms of such coding. By putting these issues up for debate, The Code of Capital fulfill itself an important epistemic role, which can be categorized as a form of democratic professionalism, i.e., professionals enabling a critical public discourse about the activities in their own field.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Why Does the Inflation Reduction Act Exclude Expensive Cancer Treatments in Price Negotiations?,; ,"PURPOSEThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes provisions for price negotiations of certain high-spending drugs in Medicare Parts B and D. This provision received considerable attention from those interested in the costs of cancer care since Medicare covers most patients with cancer and many cancer drugs are expensive. We simulate how many cancer drugs may be eligible for IRA price negotiations and examine the reasons that many are likely to be excluded from negotiation.METHODSThis study uses 2021 Medicare Fee-for-Service Part B and Part D prescription drugs expenditure data. Cancer drugs were identified using the SEER Program list of cancer medications. Our measures included total spending, beneficiary users, and spending-per-beneficiary for all cancer drugs covered under Medicare. Each drug was evaluated for eligibility on the basis of IRA negotiation provisions, including estimated loss of patent exclusivity, current competitors, and orphan drug designation.RESULTSWe found that very few cancer drugs will meet the IRA eligibility thresholds to be included in negotiations. We estimate that only 2.2% of beneficiaries with cancer will see lower costs because of the IRA negotiations. The main reason for this is that although novel cancer drug treatments are priced high, they generally treat relatively few beneficiaries and thus do not meet negotiation eligibility criteria, which are primarily based on a ranking of total spending.CONCLUSIONThe IRA negotiation provisions will have limited impact on cancer drug prices and will likely leave most patients with cancer exposed to high drug costs. Only 2.2% of Medicare beneficiaries with cancer are expected to take an Inflation Reduction Act negotiated drug.",2024,Oncology,1
Revisiting and Confronting the Federal Judiciary Capacity Crisis: Charting a Path for Federal Judiciary Reform,; ACTION FAIRNESS ACT; MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION; NATIONAL COURT; DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BANKRUPTCY COURT; DISTRICT COURTS; SUPREME-COURT; LEGAL; LAW; APPEALS,"The modern federal judiciary was established well over a century ago by the Judiciary Act of 1891. Over the next seventy years, the structure and core functioning of the judiciary largely remained unchanged apart from gradual increases in judicial slots. By the mid-1960s, jurists, scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers had voiced grave concerns about the capacity of the federal system to function effectively in the face of ever-increasing caseloads. Heeding calls for reform, in 1972 Congress charged a commission chaired by Senator Roman Hruska to study the functioning of the federal courts and recommend reforms. After extensive study, the Hruska Commission concluded that [n]o part of the federal judicial system has borne the brunt of ... increased demands [to protect individual rights and basic liberties and resolve difficult issues affecting the financial structure and commercial life of the nation] more than the courts of appeals.(1) The Commission called attention to the Supreme Court's capacity constraints and the risks to the body of national law posed by the growing number of circuit conflicts. Based on these findings, the Hruska Commission recommended that Congress establish a National Court of Appeals to alleviate the strains on the Supreme Court and regional courts of appeals. The Supreme Court would have authority to transfer cases to the new intermediate appellate court and regional circuit courts would have authority to transfer cases posing circuit splits. The proposal was initially greeted with enthusiasm but ultimately failed. Apart from the substantial repeal of three judge district courts, the division of the Fifth Circuit (creating the Eleventh Circuit), the creation of specialty courts for bankruptcy and patent appeals, and increases in the number of district court and appellate court slots, the fundamental structure of the federal appellate system has remained the same. Does this mean that the problems that galvanized attention half a century ago have abated or been addressed through other means? The data on caseloads and capacity constraints suggest otherwise. District and appellate court caseloads per judge have continued to mount and the number of certiorari petitions has more than doubled. The major impediments to judiciary reform are political, institutional, and human. Judiciary reform has become a legislative third rail, too dangerous for politicians, or even academics, to discuss. This Article revisits and confronts the growing caseload and congestion problems plaguing the federal judiciary. It begins by tracing the history and political economy surrounding judiciary reform. It then updates data on caseloads, processing times, certiorari petitions, en banc review, and other measures of judicial performance, revealing expanding caseloads and growing complexity and fragmentation of federal law. Part III explores the political, institutional, and human causes of the logjam over judiciary reform and offers an antidote: a commission tasked with developing a judiciary reform act that would not go into effect until 2030. The 2030 Commission members would not know the identity or party of the President or who controls the Senate. Furthermore, any federal judges involved in the process likely would have taken senior status or be retired by the time any reforms went into effect and thus presumably would be less concerned about how reform proposals might affect them personally. By delaying implementation, the 2030 Commission members would effectively work behind a veil of ignorance that would enable them to focus on the best interests of future generations of citizens (and judges and practitioners) while at the same time drawing upon their own experiences. The article concludes by outlining a judiciary reform agenda for the 2030 Commission.",2020,Government & Law,1
Nadorcott Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain (Tribunal Supremo) 11 June 2020-Case No. 282/2020,Breeders' rights; Exhaustion; Commercial exploitation; Right of ownership; Acts of production or reproduction; Variety constituents; Planting and harvesting; ,"Plant variety rights, like other intellectual property rights broadly considered (e.g. patents or registered designs), are alien to the effect provided for in Art. 85 of the Commercial Code (statute of limitations). The scope of the breeder's and its exhaustion are governed by the plant variety legislation itself, and no other forms or means of exhaustion of the right of ownership over tangible assets apply. There is a distinction between infringement claims as such, which concern acts of infringement subsequent to the grant of a Community plant variety right, and provisional protection in respect of acts prior to the grant. The planting of a protected variety and the harvesting of the fruits from plants of that variety may not be regarded as an act of production or reproduction (multiplication) of variety constituents within the meaning of Art. 13(2)(a) of Regulation No. 2100/94. A breeder may not prohibit the use of variety constituents for the sole purpose of producing an agricultural harvest, but merely acts leading to the reproduction and propagation of the protected variety. The activity of planting a protected variety and harvesting the fruit thereof, which is not liable to be used as propagating material, only requires the authorisation of the holder of the Community plant variety right relating to that plant variety where the conditions laid down in Art. 13(3) of that regulation are fulfilled. Article 13(3) of Regulation No. 2100/94 is interpreted as meaning that the fruit of a plant variety, which is not likely to be used as propagating material, may not be regarded as having been obtained through the unauthorised use of variety constituents of that plant variety, within the meaning of that provision, where those variety constituents were propagated and sold to a farmer by a nursery in the period between the publication of the application for a Community plant variety right in relation to that plant variety and the grant thereof. The essential prerequisite for the application of the provisional protection provided for in Art. 95 of the Regulation is that a person carries out an act that would be prohibited subsequent thereto.",2021,Government & Law,1
Exploring the 'grey areas' of state-society interaction in food sovereignty construction: the battle for Venezuela's seed law,Seed laws; state-society relations; Venezuela; food sovereignty; bottom-up policy-making; PERSPECTIVES; HISTORY; BRAZIL,"In late December 2015, amidst plummeting oil prices, highly politicized food shortages, and an all-around tense political climate in Venezuela, an unexpected event took place in the country's National Assembly just days before a major shift in its political leadership. A new seed law was passed, with provisions including bans on genetically modified seeds and the patenting of life forms, recognition of both formal and informal seed systems, and protections for the seeds of the country's peasant, Indigenous, and Afro-descendant communities. The processes behind the Law's passage were long, messy, dynamic and contentious, with unanticipated twists and turns, betrayals and alliances. This article shares an 'intimate perspective' into these processes, as described by those directly involved in them, and as seen through the combined analytical lenses of a historical, relational and interactive approach to food sovereignty construction. This includes an exploration of the shifting of roles across state-society lines; the interaction of threats and opportunities as catalysts for collective action; and incremental shifts in power as social movements engage strategically in different types of spaces, including inside, outside, through and between formal structures of the state. Such an approach complicates simplified narratives around state co-optation of movements on the one hand or idealized depictions of state-society synergy on the other, revealing the many shades of grey involved. The aim is to contribute new insights into the complexities of state-society relations in the construction of food sovereignty, and into bottom-up policy-making processes more generally.",2020,Anthropology; Development Studies,1
The role of corporate governance in the nexus between litigation risk and corporate innovation,Corporate governance; Innovation; litigation risk; Generalized method of moments; Propensity sample matching; FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS; AGENCY COSTS; SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION; POLICY UNCERTAINTY; INVESTMENT; PERFORMANCE; CHINA; FIRM; MANAGEMENT; AVOIDANCE,"Amid ongoing discussion over the merits and demerits of litigation, this study addresses the impact of litigation risk on corporate innovation at Chinese listed firms from 2014 to 2022. We exploit Two-Stage GMM, DID model, and PSM techniques to address endogeneity. We find that both litigation risk and financial constraints significantly hinder innovation. We highlight the corporate governance index as a potential moderator, which mitigates the negative impacts of litigation risk and fosters innovation. Additionally, our findings emphasize the pronounced decline in innovation among highly constrained firms compared to their counterparts with low constraints. Recent changes in China's Patent Law and Copyright Law suggest a tangible increase in innovation activities since their implementation, even within a stringent legal environment. Our findings remain robust to the use of alternative measures and estimation techniques. By addressing significant gaps in the literature, our research offers actionable insights for decision makers, emphasizing the strategic importance of corporate governance in navigating legal complexities, enhancing innovative capacity, and driving sustainable growth and competitive advantage in today's business landscape.",2024,Business & Economics,1
RETRACTED: Application of Punitive Damages in Intellectual Property Law in Complex Network Environment (Retracted Article),; TEXT; MODEL; CHINA,"Many IP (intellectual property) will also be infringed, and it will become more and more serious, causing huge economic losses to people or groups who own IP. If punitive damages can be made for intentional but intentional infringement of IP, it will help to stop intentional infringement of IP, and it can also give due compensation to the obligee's loss. Based on this, this paper analyzes the introduction and implementation of punitive damages in IP law. In this paper, a relatively efficient text classification method is realized by using the method of deep learning and model design. Similar texts in the training set are grouped into a group, and each group is considered as a common text vector. Then, a threshold is set to deal with clusters higher than the threshold, and the training set is reformed. Through the experimental results, the feature extraction effect of this model is improved, the classification accuracy is constantly improved, and the final convergence rate of this model reaches 95%. It has been verified that the system can realize the automatic classification of basic Chinese patent texts.",2022,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
A holistic method of complex product development based on a neural network-aided technological evolution system,Complex product design; Technological evolution law; Neural network; TRIZ; Cutting machine; TRIZ EVOLUTION; AXIOMATIC DESIGN; TRENDS; IDENTIFICATION; INNOVATION; SELECTION; MACHINE; SERVICE; IDEAS,"Product complexity increases along with the increase of product functions. Effective methods are required in the complex product development. Axiomatic design can effectively reduce product complexity, but there are deficiencies in the usage process and the innovation stimulation. This paper proposes a holistic method for the development of complex products by using a neural network-aided technological evolution process to control negative effects of complexity. For the first time, engineering parameters are used as the intermediary between the complexity and technological evolution. Problematic engineering parameters are extracted from a current reality tree model through a natural language process. An artificial neural network is trained to predict the technological evolution law based on existing successful samples. Appropriate analogical objects are formed in an invention principle case library through the similarity analysis of engineering parameters. The optimal scheme is developed objectively by using the coefficient variation method and Dempster combination rule. The proposed method is applied to develop a pipe cutting machine with a granted patent for its feasibility and effectiveness.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering,1
The Relentless Rise of Judicial Specialisation and its Implications for Judicial Systems,judicial studies; judicial specialisation; specialist courts; access to justice; adjudication; COURTS; DISPUTES; JUSTICE; PATENT,"Specialisation of labour has long been regarded as a central mechanism for enhancing the productivity of workers and the economic prosperity of nations. But do these advantages accrue in the judicial resolution of disputes, or should judges be generalists administering the law as an integrated body of rules and principles? Viewing the evolution of courts across the common law world, the rise of judicial specialisation has been relentless-suggesting that it delivers significant benefits. It extends far beyond specialisation by legal subject matter and it is achieved through many modalities beyond the establishment of new courts. However, to understand the proper role of specialisation, it is necessary to ask what impact it has on core values of the judicial system, namely, cost-effectiveness, just outcomes, impartiality, public trust, access to justice, and procedural fairness. This essay argues that judicial specialisation often has competing impacts on these values but that careful institutional design, especially through hybrid specialisation, can deliver significant benefits while minimising costs. Modern judicial systems need to be attentive to the diverse effects of specialisation so they can adapt to the complexities of contemporary dispute resolution.",2022,Government & Law,1
Comparative legal analysis of protectability of olfactory trademarks,Exclusive rights; trademark registration; non-traditional means of individualization; olfactory trademark; patent law; ,"In the current growing global commercial turnover of goods and services, there are increasing demands on the ways of their individualization. This applies both to traditional methods of individualization (corporate name, trademark, commercial designation, name of origin, etc.) and non-traditional (olfactory trademarks). The purpose of this study is to study and analyze doctrinal concepts, norms of the current legislation, and law enforcement practice concerning the protection of rights of olfactory trademarks. In order to achieve this objective, the study used a comparative legal method, which analyzed the legal and regulatory framework, as well as the grounds for refusing to register non-traditional trademarks in various legal systems and national jurisdictions. The task of the authors was to conduct a comprehensive study of legislative regulation and practice of legal protection of olfactory trademarks in various jurisdictions. The result of the research is the formulation of a general trend in different jurisdictions toward the legislation on registration of exclusive rights to non-traditional trademarks, which with the help of aromas (smells) allow individualizing the owners of goods produced by them and/or commercial services provided.",2020,Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
History and Overview of Breast Pumps and Expressed Breastmilk,breast; breastfeeding; breast milk; expression; difficulties; pumping; ,"Objective: Breast pumps have been seen since antiquity and have become a ubiquitous part of breastfeeding. Breast pumps are used for numerous reasons and have become incorporated into law and regulations in the United States. Breast pumps have allowed breastfeeding and lactation to proceed both under normal conditions and with significant challenges. However, the rapid proliferation of breast pumps and their heavy promotion have prompted social criticism regarding whether pumps have displaced the promotion of direct breastfeeding and deflected addressing more pressing social issues such as greater investment in breastfeeding promotion and care and the creation of a national paid family leave policy.Methods: This survey of the history of breast pumps and accompanying concerns utilized historical and current references, U.S. patents, and perusal of government laws and regulations. Results: This history of breast pumps and accompanying concerns highlights the progression of breast pump technology, exposes social criticism of breast pumps, discusses alterations in expressed milk composition, and raises the possibility of altered infant health outcomes from consuming pumped breastmilk.Conclusions: Breast pump use is a necessity for many families and should be balanced against the potential of interfering with the breastfeeding relationship.",2023,Nursing,1
"Early firm engagement, government research funding, and the privatization of public knowledge",Researchfunding; Public knowledge; Early firm engagement; Science-based innovation; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; LIFE-SCIENCE; IMPACT; COLLABORATION; ECONOMICS; OUTPUTS; COSTS,"Early firm engagement in the scientific discovery process in public institutions is an important form of science-based innovation. However, early firm engagement may negatively affect the academic value of public papers due to firms' impulse to privatize public knowledge. In this paper, we crawl all patent and paper text data of the Distinguished Young Scholars of the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) in the chemical and pharmaceutical field. We use semantic recognition techniques to establish the link between scientific discovery papers and patented technologies to explore the relationship between the quality of public knowledge production, government research funding, and early firm engagement in the science-based innovation process. The empirical results show that, first, there is a relatively smooth inverted U-shaped relationship between government research funding for scholars and the quality of their publications. An initial increase in government research funding positively drives the quality of public knowledge production, but the effect turns negative when research funding is excessive. Second, government research funding for scholars can act as a value signal, triggering the firm's impulse to privatize high-value scientific discoveries. Hence, early firm engagement moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship such that at low levels of research funding, early firm engagement can improve the quality of public knowledge production, and at high levels of research funding, early firm engagement can further reduce the quality of public knowledge production.",2022,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,1
"Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP) Regime in Canada: Amendments and Analysis of Granted, Pending, and Refused CSP Applications",Certificate of Supplementary Protection; Shingrix; Belsomra; CSP Register; Minister of Health Canada; ,"According to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), Canada introduced Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP) regime on 21 September 2017. Before CETA was executed, Canada was the only country of G7 (Group of 7) countries not to legislate Patent Term Extension (PTE). On 21 September 2020, CSP regime completed three years of existence. During these three years, few changes took effect in CSP regime. This article provides in-depth evaluation of CSP regime and such relevant changes.

Experimental and CFD Analysis of a Gas-Lubricated Foil Thrust Bearing for Various Foil Configurations,Self-acting; air foil thrust bearing; cascaded foils; square foils; wedge film; pressure profile; and stiffness; FINITE-ELEMENT,"Thrust foil bearings operating at hydrodynamic conditions are self-acting (aerodynamic) bearings that support high-speed shafts at mild loading conditions with air as a lubricant and are generally used in low-power gas turbines. This paper presents an experimental study and a detailed computational analysis of dynamic characteristics of the foil thrust bearing (FTB) in terms of load-carrying capabilities as a function of thrust runner speed and gap between the bearing assembly and the runner by considering the effect of bearing parameters such as number of foils, shape of the foils, and assembly of foils on the bearing pad. The parametric study was conducted on a newly conceptualized bearing test rig capable of rotating up to 45,000 rpm speeds that measured the axial loads of the air foil thrust bearings (AFTB). The computational model of the foil thrust bearings for various configurations with top foils is simulated using multiphysics software for foil deflections and pressure distributions on the foil surface. The numerical results were compared with the experimental values, while the air foil thrust bearings with multilayered foils called cascaded foils (patented) had higher load capability in comparison to other conventional bearing models.",2023,Engineering,1

How does environmental legislation affect enterprise investment preferences? A quasi-natural experiment based on China's new environmental protection law,Enterprise investment preferences; Environmental legislation; New environmental protection law; RISK-TAKING; CORPORATE,"China's New Environmental Protection Law (NEPL) represents a significant shift from the traditional administration to environmental legalization. Polluting enterprises face more pronounced contradictions between short-term environmental compliance and long-term development. Therefore, based on the CNRDS and CSMAR databases, this paper uses the 2015 NEPL as a quasi-natural experiment to investigate the micro-effects and mechanisms of environmental legislation on firms' investment preferences and environmental performance. The main findings of this paper are as follows. (1) The implementation of the NEPL effectively promotes the key pollutant-discharge enterprises (PDEs) to increase similar financial and environmental investment, and furthermore, the endogenous financing attributes of short-term financial investments can also provide financing for long-term environmental investment. This is due to the reservoir motive and the improvement in the executives' environmental awareness and green attention. (2) The NEPL exhibits heterogeneous policy effects. The key PDEs with political connections are more concerned about environmental management and investment. However, the NEPL's positive impact on environmental investment is weakened in regions with high levels of environmental justice. (3) A shift in the key PDEs' investment structure triggers a series of economic and environmental effects, such as increasing their risk-taking capacity, reducing environmental uncertainty, and significantly improving green patents. This paper provides policy implications for the process of environmental legalization in China and other developing countries.",2024,Business & Economics,1
"Adam Smith on reputation, commutative justice, and defamation laws",Adam Smith; Reputation; Commutative justice; Defamation; Libel; Slander; Perfect rights; Natural jurisprudence; Esotericism; ,"We interpret Adam Smith on reputation, commutative justice, and defamation laws. We address two major questions. The first question concerns whether Smith thought that one's own as covered by commutative justice included one's reputation. Several passages point to the affirmative. But reputation is left out of Smith's most sacred laws description of commutative justice. Most importantly, so much of reputation-e.g., Steve's work stinks-does not fit Smith's description of commutative justice's rules (precise and accurate). Our reading makes use of older terminology from Pufendorf, Carmichael, and Hutcheson distinguishing simple and intensive reputation, and suggests that the reputation that sometimes appears in Smith's characterizations of one's own is of a simple variety (Steve steals horses) that potentially incites invasion of commutative justice's three staples-person, property, promises due. On that reading the reputation that comes under commutative justice, though not a staple, belongs to the penumbra around the three staples, just as incitement and endangerment belong to that penumbra. We also recruit Hume, who nowhere even hinted at reputation being a constituent of commutative justice. The second question is: Did Smith favor defamation laws (libel, slander) that reached beyond simple reputation, so as to cover some intensive-reputation detraction? Were Smith to favor intensive-reputation defamation laws (against, say, Steve's work stinks), we would have to count that as another exception made to the liberty principle. Smith's remarks are mixed, but we think he was rather inclined against aggressive or extensive laws of such kind. (Also, we draw a parallel to patent and copyright.) We also suggest that if Smith thought that wantonly telling malicious lies like Steve's work stinks was not in violation of commutative justice and, moreover, is best left perfectly legal, those are judgments that the liberal project's great prophet would hardly want to make plain, because indifferent readers would misunderstand them and adversaries would misrepresent them.

Case Report: Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome Type 6 and Dyschromatosis Symmetrica Hereditaria With Congenital Heart Disease and Mitral Valve Calcification - Phenotypic Variants Caused by Adenosine Deaminase Acting on the RNA 1 Gene Homozygous Mutations,AGS 6; DSH; ADAR1 homozygous mutations; PDA; VSD; mitral valve calcification; ADAR1 GENE,"Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), characterized by a mixture of hyper- and hypopigmented macules on the skin, is a rare pigmentary dermatosis of autosomal dominant inheritance. The pathogenic gene is adenosine deaminase acting on the RNA 1 gene (ADAR1), mutations in this gene also lead to Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 6 (AGS 6), a rare hereditary encephalopathy with isolated spastic paraplegia. The pathomechanism of the ADAR1 gene mutations inducing DSH has not been clarified yet. We report the first case of DSH combined with AGS caused by the homozygous mutation of the ADAR1 gene in China (c.1622T > A) and reviewed the relevant literature. AGS 6 could occur in both men and women, and start in infancy. The main characteristics are growth retardation, skin depigmentation, intracranial calcification, and cerebral white matter lesions. In the current paper, the proband also had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and mitral valve calcification, which are new symptoms that have not been reported in other cases. Additionally, we also aim to discuss the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical heterogeneity caused by ADAR1 gene mutations.",2022,Pediatrics,1
Common childhood illnesses: a cross-sectional study of commodity stocking patterns and management knowledge among patent and proprietary medicine vendors in Nigeria,Child Health; PPMV; Common Childhood Illnesses Management; Under Five; Malaria; MALARIA,"Background The trio of commonest illnesses and causes mortality among children under five (Malaria, Pneumonia and Diarrhea) are easily treatable through timely exposure to cost effective interventions at the community level. Patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs) are a leading source of care for illnesses among under-five children in Nigeria. This study was designed to explore child health services offering, particularly commodity stocking patterns and case management knowledge for common childhood illnesses among PPMVs in Ebonyi and Kaduna States. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among PPMVs in four local government areas across Ebonyi and Kaduna States. Data was collected using semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaires. Information was obtained on medicine and supplies, knowledge of common childhood illnesses management and referral practices. Results A total of 374 PPMVs were interviewed; the mean age was 33.7 +/- 9.8 years. Among the 132 health trained respondents, 59.0% offer treatment services for sick children while 83.5% of the non-health trained respondents offer the same service. At least, 88.0% of the respondents keep stock ACTs, Amoxycilin DT, ORS and Zinc. About 38.5% reported stock-out of ACTs in the month preceding the study, 55.1% reported stock out lasting only 0 to 6 days. Only 83 (22.2%) of respondents knew the correct diagnosis of fast breathing among children aged 2 to less than 12 months old. Education and health training background were associated with a good knowledge of common childhood illnesses management (X-2 = 44.88, p < 0.001; X-2 = 27.14, p < 0.001). Conclusion The relative constant availability of medicines and commodities for managing childhood illnesses positions PPMVs as a preferred source of care for these illnesses. There is a need to complement steady stock availability with provision of quality services by exposing PPMVs to trainings on integrated community case management of childhood illnesses and implementation of robust supervision mechanism to monitor them.",2022,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
"Advancing the use of Long-Acting Extended Delivery formulations for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa: challenges, opportunities, and recommendations",adolescent girls and young women; Africa; men who have sex with men; PrEP; prevention; stigma; long-acting; CABOTEGRAVIR,"IntroductionThe burden of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains unacceptably high, and disproportionately affects girls and women. While the introduction of oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012 revolutionized HIV prevention, its effectiveness is dependent on user adherence and its implementation in SSA has faced numerous challenges. Patient-level, interpersonal and structural barriers, including, for example, daily pill burden, side effects, lack of partner support, testing and disclosure, and costs have been found to reduce adherence to oral PrEP.DiscussionLong-acting extended delivery (LAED) formulations for PrEP, such as injectable long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA) and dapivirine vaginal ring (DPV-VR) are critical additions to the HIV prevention toolkit and are especially important for populations such as adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and other key populations who remain at significant risk of HIV acquisition while facing substantial barriers to preventive services. These LAED formulations have been shown to result in better adherence and fewer side effects, with CAB-LA being superior to oral PrEP in reducing the risk of HIV acquisition. They can be used to overcome user burden and adherence challenges. However, the successful rollout of the DPV-VR and CAB-LA may be hampered by issues such as a shortage of healthcare providers (HCPs), inadequate parenteral medication infrastructure, increased workload for HCPs, patient concerns, the price of the medications and the possibility of drug resistance.ConclusionsSSA must develop laboratory capabilities for monitoring patients on LAED formulations and enhance research on developing more non-injectable LAED formulations. There is a need to train and retain more HCPs, implement task shifting, invest in healthcare infrastructure and integrate healthcare services. To reduce costs and improve availability, the region must advocate for patent license waivers for LAED formulations and procure drugs collectively as a region.",2023,Immunology; Infectious Diseases,1
The private sector market for malaria rapid diagnostic tests in Nigeria: results of the 2018 market survey,Private sector healthcare; Case management; Diagnostics; Health economics; Malaria control; Informal health workers; Private sector engagement; Targeted subsidy; Private sector co-payment mechanism; IMPACT; ACT,"Background To avoid misuse of anti-malarials, correct diagnosis of fever prior to drug prescription is essential. Presumptive treatment in the private healthcare sector is a concern in Nigeria, where availability of affordable artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is high following the implementation of subsidy schemes from 2010 to 2017. Similar subsidies have not, however, been implemented for malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). A market survey in 2018 predominantly designed to assess the ACT market in the private sector also collected data related to RDTs, results of which are presented herein. Methods A 2018 market survey consisted of (i) an outlet survey targeting private pharmacies and Proprietary and Patent Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) across different regions of Nigeria to assess supply-side market factors related to availability of RDTs (defined as having stock available for purchase at the time of the survey) and (ii) a household survey to determine demand-side factors related to knowledge of RDTs, healthcare-seeking practices and affordability. Results Availability of RDTs at the time of the survey was low in both outlet types and significantly lower in PPMVs (22.1%, 95% CI) among pharmacies versus (13.6%, 95% CI) among PPMVs (p < 0.01). Reasons for not restocking RDTs included low demand and no supply. The majority of households diagnose malaria based on experience, while one-third would visit a PPMV or pharmacy. Half of households had heard of RDTs (48.4%) and 38.6% thought they were affordable. Conclusions Low availability of RDTs among PPMVs and pharmacies may be attributed to lack of demand, supply-side issues and cost. Increasing household knowledge of RDTs may aid increasing demand, while subsidized RDTs may address supply and price issues. Addressing the deficit in RDT provision is important for targeting of ACT medicines.",2022,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,1
Social venture scaling: Does the technological environment matter?,Social venture scaling; Scaling; Social entrepreneurship; Technological environment; Technological endowment; Arbitrage opportunity; ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; IMPACT; REGRESSIONS; ENTERPRISES; GROWTH,"In a generalizable multi-year sample of U.S. counties, we demonstrate that horizontal scaling of social ventures is explained by technological factors including technological endowment (patent stock) and the availability of technological arbitrage opportunity, as well as the growth in these two factors over time. Both the technological endowment and the availability of technological arbitrage opportunity are positively related to social venture scaling. However, growth in the technological endowment eases the pressure on social entrepreneurs to act thus exerting negative impact on social venture scaling. At the same time, growth in the availability of technological arbitrage opportunity indicates that the relative efficiency within the county lags behind the frontier established by the leading counties, which may exacerbate social ills to which social entrepreneurs respond. Accordingly, it exerts a positive impact on social venture scaling observed.",2023,Business & Economics; Public Administration,1

Research funding has been used as an instrument to direct research agenda and promote technology partnership. The study examines how research funding is associated with various academic engagement in the context of Singapore, a country with explicit policies to encourage university-industry collaboration. Based on a survey with 276 academics in STEM fields, we find that research funding does play a role in academic engagement. In particular, funding from industry is observed to have a significant correlation with patent licensing, consultancy, and serving on advisory board. In addition to funding, more on-the-ground university and government effort to support academic scientists in their commercialisation activity, in particular, new ventures, would be helpful.",2020,Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics,1

We find that UTSA-impacted firms shift their IP strategy to rely more on trade secrets and less on patents. Less IP disclosure increases information asymmetry and rival firms must adapt their competitive strategies as espionage and reverse engineering become more costly. Predation risk increases, and rivals engage in more intense price and non-price competition. Additionally, we find the probability of being acquired increases post-UTSA as rivals seek to acquire innovation, resulting in more concentrated product markets. Further, we find that the stock market generally views UTSA favorably.",2023,Business & Economics,1

More specifically, we set up and test a horizontal R&D-based growth model with endogenous labor supply where leisure time may enhance inventors' productivity and therefore have (under specific conditions) positive long run effects on the accumulation of new disembodied knowledge. Our main result in the theoretical model which is confirmed empirically is that leisure time can be beneficial for innovation in situations where there are weak spillovers arising from past ideas in the invention of new ones.",2022,Business & Economics,1
How Principal Investigators' Commercial Experience Influences Technology Transfer and Market Impacts,Principal investigators; Technology transfer; Market impact; University-industry collaboration; Commercial experience; UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY COLLABORATION; INNOVATION,"Overview:Businesses can benefit from university-industry collaborations, yet they rarely take full advantage of them. Scientists who serve as principal investigators (PIs) act as the nucleus of university-industry collaborations and partner with industry to cocreate value. We conducted a case study of PIs at publicly funded research universities, institutes, and organizations in Ireland to explore how having commercial experience influences how PIs approach technology transfer and how they develop new business models, products, and services. We learned that PIs' prior commercial experience influences how they approach their research, project work, and project selection and affects how they commercialize knowledge and outputs from their scientific research--that is, patents, licences, agreements, etc.--throughout the project's life cycle. In university-industry collaborations, PIs' commercial experience can impact industry partners' attempts to realize technology transfer and market impacts.",2020,Business & Economics; Engineering,1
Corporate crimes and innovation: Evidence from US financial firms,Financial institutions and services; Innovation and invention; Criminal law; Litigation process; IMPACT; LITIGATION; ORGANIZATIONS,"This study explores how corporate crimes affect innovation. We utilize a large sample of US financial firms between 2002 and 2019, along with violations and misconducts. We find that fraudulent financial firms innovate fewer new products, services, and patents. The negative association between corporate wrongdoings and inno-vation is more prominent for small and risky financial firms. Further analysis documents that misconduct gen-erates negative market reaction and damages firms' business expansions. These findings between corporate violations and operating performance are among the first empirical evidence for the finance industry where misconduct is widespread. Our results offer new insights into the real impact of unethical behaviors on financial firms' innovation performance. From a policy perspective, our study suggests how reputational damage can impede firms' technological progress.",2023,Business & Economics,1

Our patient had delayed migration of a ductal occluder device into the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) 6 months after its deployment. Because of critical biventricular dysfunction, urgent surgical removal of the device from the descending aorta was done via left posterolateral thoracotomy without using cardiopulmonary bypass. PDA was not closed because of doubt about the reversibility of pulmonary artery hypertension and severe right ventricular dysfunction so that it can act as an outlet to the decompensated right ventricle.

Our empirical results also show that corruption at the firm level, in the manufacturing industry, and in regions with the worst governance or that are more corrupt has a significant negative effect on innovation. In addition, country governance plays a particularly important role in innovative activity for corrupt firms. The policy implication is that the government or authority should strengthen the positive role of government effectiveness, rule of law, regulatory quality, and control of corruption in order to improve firms' innovation within an environment of corruption.",2020,Business & Economics,1

Analysis of Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) and Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP) Manufacturing Waivers and Their Impact on Pharmaceutical Industry,Certificate of supplementary protection; Manufacturing waiver; Patent term extension; Supplementary protection certificate; USFDA; ,"Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) is a type of Intellectual Property Right which extends the patent term and is applicable to approved specific pharmaceutical and plant protection products in European Union (EU). On 01 July 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/933 of 20 May 2019 concerning SPC came into force. It is also referred as the SPC manufacturing waiver Regulation and was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 11 June 2019. Similarly, Canada also introduced Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP) Regulations on 21 September 2017. It is governed by provisions in the Canadian Patent Act and the CSP Regulations. These developments would have impact on global pharmaceutical industry including United States of America (US). US being the largest pharmaceutical market, policy making in US has direct and indirect impact on global pharmaceutical industry. Thus, it is important to study SPC or CSP manufacturing waiver in light of the developments in the USA. On 30 October 2019, United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) released a report on Drug Shortages. Apart from identifying root causes for drug shortages, the Report also recommended enduring solutions to maintain or enhance the quality of medicines and manufacturing facilities. This research work compares EU and Canadian SPC/CSP manufacturing waiver developments with each other. In-depth analysis of the impact of these SPC/CSP manufacturing waivers on competition amongst pharmaceutical companies, economic impact on patients and pharmaceutical companies, swifter access to generic medicines, rise of new generic companies has been carried out. The impact of suggestion from USFDA to create a rating system for manufacturing facilities in light of these SPC/CSP manufacturing waiver is also studied. It was observed that there are few important differences between these manufacturing waivers of EU and Canada. These waivers would have an impact on the manufacturing facilities of pharmaceutical product. It could change the manufacturing clusters like China and India, which exists today and would increase the competition amongst the pharmaceutical manufactures. It is likely to help reduce the cost of generic medicines especially in USA and EU region.",2020,Government & Law,1
TO WAIVE OR NOT TO WAIVE: THE DEBATE AND ANALYSIS OF TRIPS WAIVER,WTO; TRIPS Agreement; TRIPS Waiver Proposal; TRIPS Waiver; compulsory license; patent; COVID-19 vaccine inequity; COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics; intellectual property rights; pandemic; international law; ,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reignited the decades-long debate over intellectual property rights (hereinafter IPRs) and global inequitable access to medical products. After heated debates over South Africa and India's IPRs waiver proposal, on June 17, 2022, the World Trade Organization (WTO) members finally agreed to waive patent rights on COVID-19 vaccines with limited conditions and delayed the discussion on waiver extension to COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics. In this battle against COVID-19, it is true that the global community has made progress in successfully developing effective medical products, but then the inequity in access to those products between developed and developing countries causes it to be further behind than it was when it made progress. The virus never distinguishes between rich and poor countries, and access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics shouldn't either. This article argues that waiving IPRs on COVID-19 medical products could improve global access to them. It compares both sides of the debate and emphasizes that a broader coverage of types of IPRs and pharmaceutical products is necessary to achieve global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and pharmaceutical products. In addition to lowering IPR barriers through the Waiver, increasing manufacturing capacity and re- distributing the global stockpile are also important solutions to making pharmaceutical products available to those in need.",2023,Health Care Sciences & Services; International Relations; Government & Law,1
AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF GENDER AND RACE IN TRADEMARK PROSECUTION,; SERVICE MARKS; WAGE PENALTY; INNOVATION; DISCRIMINATION; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; INDICATOR; WOMENS; BIAS,"This Article is the first to empirically examine the extent to which women and minorities succeed in prosecuting trademark applications before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Trademark registration is an important measure of entrepreneurial activity and progress in business, education, and the arts. To explore how women and minorities are succeeding in this domain, we compared 1.2 million trademark applications over thirty years with demographic information on race and gender. We analyze whether trademark prosecution reflects systematic underrepresentation of women and minorities similar to those reported in patent and copyright prosecution. We found that trademark data showed significant differences from the other two federal intellectual property (IP) regimes. Our analysis reveals that women regularly secure trademark registration at a higher rate than men. Women are underrepresented in the pool of trademark applicants compared to their presence in the population, but not all minority groups are underrepresented. For women and underrepresented minorities, the disparity is decreasing at a rate not seen in other IP registration systems. While recent work has significantly advanced our understanding of trademark prosecution, no published studies consider the race and gender of trademark applicants. By filling that void, this Article substantially contributes to our understanding of minority intellectual property ownership and provides a new foundation for policy shifts and further research to assure that intellectual property ownership paths, theory, law, and reform are grounded in equality.",2021,Government & Law,1
Stromal LAG-3+cells infiltration defines poor prognosis subtype muscle-invasive bladder cancer with immunoevasive contexture,urinary bladder neoplasms; immune evation; immunotherapy; LAG-3; CHEMOTHERAPY,"Background Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) is a promising immune checkpoint therapeutic target being evaluated in clinical trials. We assessed the LAG-3(+)cells distribution, its association with clinical outcomes and immune contexture and its role in the landscape of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) treatment. Methods 141 patients with MIBC from Zhongshan Hospital were included for survival and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) benefit analyses. 32 fresh resected samples of MIBC were collected to detect CD8(+)T cells functional state. The molecular classification analyses were based on 391 patients with MIBC from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were performed to characterize various immune cells infiltration. Results In Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox regression models, stromal LAG-3(+)cells enrichment was consistently associated with inferior overall survival and disease-free survival, and indicated suboptimal responsiveness to ACT. Patents with high stromal LAG-3(+)cells possessed increased protumor cells, immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoint expression. The phenotypic analyses of CD8(+)T cells correlated its dysfunctional state with LAG-3(+)cells. Besides, LAG-3 mRNA level was linked to luminal and basal subtypes of MIBC. LAG-3-high tumors exhibited limited FGFR3 mutation and signaling signature, and displayed activated immunotherapeutic and EGFR-associated pathway. Conclusions Stromal LAG-3(+)cells abundance indicated an immunoevasive contexture with dysfunctional CD8(+)T cells, and represented an independent predictor for adverse survival outcome and ACT resistance in MIBC. LAG-3 expression could potentially be a novel biomarker for FGFR3-targeted and EGFR-targeted therapies and immunotherapy. The crucial role of LAG-3(+)cells in the therapeutic landscape of MIBC needs further validation retrospectively and prospectively.",2020,Oncology; Immunology,1
Hypozincemia in Chronic Hepatitis C Is Improved with Viral Clearance by Direct-acting Antiviral Agents,hypozincemia; hepatitis C; direct-acting antiviral agents; AMINO-ACIDS; ZINC; VIRUS; METABOLISM; THERAPY; BINDING,"Objective Hypozincemia is a decrease in the serum zinc level of patients with hepatitis C and often requires zinc supplementation to improve the hepatic function. Our previous study showed the efficacy of direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) treatment on serum zinc levels in patients with hepatitis C without zinc supplementation. In this study. we aimed to prospectively examine factors related to the improvement of serum zinc levels of patents with hepatitis C with DAA treatment. Methods Fifty-three patients with hepatitis C treated with DAA5 between March 2018 and February 2019 at a university medical center were divided into two groups based on their initial serum level: the zinc deficiency group (n=43, <80 mu g/dL) and the normal zinc group (n=10, >= 80 mu g/dL). Their serum zinc levels and clinical parameters were measured before DAA treatment, at the end of treatment and 12 weeks posttreatment. Results All 53 patients achieved a sustained viral response to DAA5 at the end of treatment and at followup. There was a significant increase in the serum zinc level from baseline to follow-up in the zinc deficiency group but not in the normal zinc group. The change in serum albumin was the only factor contributing to the observed increase in serum zinc levels by a multiple regression analysis. Conclusion DAA treatment in patients with hepatitis C improved hypozincemia due to the restored function of serum albumin, which binds to about 60% of serum zinc, upon the amelioration of the hepatitis C infection.",2021,General & Internal Medicine,1
The impacts of trade-related international intellectual property rights on domestic legislative debates: Evidence from the 104th to the 112th U.S. Congresses,Congress; intellectual property; trade; United States; FAST-TRACK; POLICY; CANADA; TRIPS,"Despite the large body of literature on the connection between intellectual property rights (IPRs) and trade at the international level, less attention has been paid to the impacts of such rights included in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) on domestic legislative debates. This article contributes to filling this gap by analyzing debates in the U.S. legislature where the IPRs included in PTAs were referred to. We consider the 1995-2012 period (104th to 112th Congresses). We also analyze trade laws enacted by Congress over the period. The data suggest that the IPRs negotiated with foreign partners affect Congress voting on the concession of trade promotion authority to the president. They may also trigger urges for adjustments to trade agreements and be tapped into by members of Congress to advocate for changes to domestic patent legislation. The importance placed on IPRs by members of Congress was not consistent over time and across parties. These results suggest that theoretical explanations of the U.S. trade policy must account for the diversity of views at the domestic level and for how such often divergent sentiments translate into policies, as framed by the domestic laws and institutions in place.",2020,Government & Law,1
Efficacy of Shugan Hewei Therapy for Chronic Atrophic Gastritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Chinese herbal medicine; Chronic atrophic gastritis; Efficacy; Meta-analysis; Shugan Hewei therapy; ,"Objective:Shugan Hewei therapy (SHT) acts to soothe the liver and harmonize the stomach. It is a classical traditional Chinese medicine method widely used in China to treat chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) due to liver qi invading the stomach. However, the clinical effects of SHT remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate the overall clinical effective rate and safety of SHT in treating CAG. Methods:We used the Jadad scale and Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool to evaluate the methodological quality of studies investigating SHT. Eight medical databases were searched to identify relevant studies. After data extraction and quality evaluation, 27 randomized controlled trials, including 2,441 patients, were considered eligible for analysis. No serious heterogeneity or publication bias was observed across the included studies. We used Revman 5.3 statistical software to evaluate the general clinical effective rate and safety of SHT. Results:The results showed that SHT was more effective (RR=1.25; 95% CI [1.20, 1.29]; P<0.01) and safer (MD=0.24, 95% CI [0.08, 0.75]; P<0.01) than control interventions comprising western medicine, Chinese patent medicine, and/or western medicine + Chinese patent medicine. Compared with the control interventions, SHT resulted in greater improvements in the symptom scores for stomach distension and stomachache, serum gastrin level, histopathologic changes, Helicobacter pylori (HP) inhibition rate, and gastric mucosal inflammation. Conclusion:SHT was more effective and safer than control interventions for CAG.",2022,History & Philosophy of Science; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1
The Relative Contributions of NIH and Private Sector Funding to the Approval of New Biopharmaceuticals,NIH funding; FDA approval; March-in Rights; Bayh-Dole Act; ,"Objectives There remains ongoing debate regarding the relative efficacy of public (NIH) and private sector funding in bringing biopharmaceutical innovations to market. This paper investigates the significance of each party's level of funding for obtaining Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization. Methods A cohort of research projects linked to 23,230 National Institute of Health grants awarded in the year 2000 was audited to account for patents, where the project led to a product in clinical development and potentially FDA approval. A total of 8126 associated patents led to the identification of 41 therapies that registered clinical trials; 18 of these therapies received FDA approved. Results NIH funding for the 18 FDA-approved therapies totaled $0.670 billion, whereas private sector funding (excluding post-approval funding) totaled $44.3 billion. A logistic regression relating the levels of public and private funding to the probability of FDA approval indicates a positive and significant relationship between private sector funding and the likelihood of FDA approval (p <= 0.0004). The relationship between public funding and the likelihood of FDA approval is found to be negative and not statistically significant. Conclusion Our study results underscore that the development of basic discoveries requires substantial additional investments, partnerships, and the shouldering of financial risk by the private sector if therapies are to materialize as FDA-approved medicine. Our finding of a potentially negative relationship between public funding and the likelihood that a therapy receives FDA approval requires additional study.",2023,Medical Informatics; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Clopidogrel can be an effective complementary prophylactic for drug-refractory migraine with patent foramen ovale,medicine; pain; TO-LEFT SHUNT; TRANSCATHETER CLOSURE; PERCUTANEOUS CLOSURE; AURA; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE; ULTRASOUND; THERAPY,"The present study aims to determine the potential prophylactic effect of clopidogrel for migraine with patent foramen ovale (PFO) in patients who are poor responders to two or more common preventive medications. Migraineurs underwent contrast-enhanced transcranial doppler examination to confirm the presence of PFO and determine the right-to-left shunt degree. Clopidogrel 75 mg/day was added to the existing prophylactic regimen for 3 months and 6 months. The presence of PFO was found in 56.8% (151/266) of all patients with migraine and 70.2% (59/84) of migraine with aura (MHA), and among MHA a large shunt was observed in 36 patients. Twenty-six patients with drug-refractory migraine took clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 3 months. Compared with those at baseline, headache frequencies and attack durations were significantly lower (6.17 +/- 3.93/month (M) vs 3.28 +/- 2.67/M, p=0.003; 13.62 +/- 13.98/hour (H) vs 7.36 +/- 7.33/H, p=0.0049, respectively); visual analog scale scores and migraine disability assessment scores were also obviously decreased (6.32 +/- 1.97 vs 4.71 +/- 1.20, p<0.001; 22.14 +/- 7.13 vs 16.00 +/- 5.92, p=0.001, respectively). These improvements were maintained for 6 months in 12 patients. We concluded that PFO was closely correlated with migraine, especially in MHA. Clopidogrel could act as an effective complementary prophylactic for migraine with PFO in patients with poor response to routine prophylactics.",2020,General & Internal Medicine; Research & Experimental Medicine,1

There are no specialist tools for cutting the anterior lamina of the transverse processes, and alternatives lead to questionable results. A novel tool, the transversoclasiotome, is described and tested. The literature and patent databases were systematically reviewed. A blueprint of the transversoclasiotome was created, and the prototype was tested through autopsy on ten fresh-frozen cadavers within our Body Donation Program. The transversoclasiotome consists of two delicate branches mounted as a scissor, one a cutting jaw and the other a knocker with a rounded tip, both angled 30 degrees to the principal axis. The jaws shut, facing each other in parallel. The cutting jaw corresponds to a slit on the knocker profile without protruding beyond it even when entirely closed. It acts by cutting and wedging. The testing autopsies demonstrated its suitability for its purpose, with an adequate response to the pressure exerted on the bone lamina. The section cut cleanly, without sliding off while closing on the bone. The vertebral vessels were not injured either during instrument insertion or cutting. Their morphological features are described. The transversoclasiotome has been proven appropriate for sectioning the anterior lamina of transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. It meets the needs of clinical anatomy in teaching and training clinicians or surgeons, forensic clinical anatomy during medico-legal investigation, and research.",2024,Legal Medicine; Pathology,1
Assessing the Performance of Permeable Pavement in Mitigating Flooding in Urban Areas,permeable pavement; monitoring instruments and management systems; flow law formula; low-impact development; ,"In the case of rapid urban development, the impact of extreme climates on the world is gradually increasing, resulting in frequent flood events. However, Taiwan is still in the stage of urban development, and it is necessary to develop more roads. Therefore, determining how to reduce the impact of road engineering on the environment is one of the major issues currently faced. Therefore, a demonstration road of a general pavement and a permeable pavement was built in Dahua North Street, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, and rainwater was stored in a central irrigation ditch and a permeable pavement through an innovative construction method for reuse in agricultural irrigation. In addition, monitoring instruments and management systems were built, and the flow law formula was established, with R-2 greater than 0.9. The actual discharge and peak discharge of the permeable pavement and general pavement were analyzed. According to the data analysis results, it can be seen that the permeable pavement can effectively reduce the peak discharge of 60 similar to 75%, which not only can achieve the benefit of low-impact development but also can reuse rainwater. The patent application can be used as an example for the application of permeable pavement in Taiwan in the future.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,1
Operating risk of enterprises when adopting environmental regulation: Evidence from environmental protection law in China,Operating risk; Environmental regulation; Innovation incentive; Environmental management; GREEN INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE; POLLUTION REGULATION; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; POLICY; FIRMS; MIX,"Addressing the negative externality of pollutant emissions requires environmental regulations. The well -designed environmental regulation can stimulate innovation and reinforce management, which may lead to operating risk decreases in heavily polluting firms. This study evaluates the effect of environmental regulations using the enactment of the Chinese New Environmental Protection Law (NEPL) in 2015 as an exogenous shock. Our difference -in -differences estimation shows that the deterrent of the NEPL reduces the operating risk of heavily polluting firms, and the relationships are robust to different specifications and alternative settings. We also find that the impact of the NEPL is more pronounced in subsamples with higher ex -ante innovation and improved environmental management. Further evidence shows that innovative firms may be better positioned to develop green technologies by patenting to comply with environmental regulations. Moreover, the improved environmental management practices under regulations may attract more analyst attention which help firms build a positive reputation in the market. Such responses to comply with environmental regulations ultimately reduce the operating risk of firms. Overall, our study sheds light on the micro mechanisms behind the NEPL's effect on firms' operating risk, providing implications and references for policymakers and firm managers.",2024,Business & Economics,1
"Ajinomoto Co. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n United States Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit, 2019 932 F.3d 1342",; ,"The patent claim at issue in this case recites a method for producing an aromatic L-amino acid, such as L-tryptophan, by fermentation. The method involves the use of a recombinant E. coli bacterium that has been engineered to express higher-than-natural levels of YddG, a membrane protein that transports aromatic L-amino acids out of the bacterial cell and into the surrounding culture medium. The claim recites various means of increasing YddG expression, including by introducing multiple genes encoding the YddG protein into the bacterium's chromosome. As originally filed, the claim defined the protein as either (a) a protein having the exact amino acid sequence of E. coli YddG (as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2), or (b) a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence including deletion, substitution, insertion or addition of one or several amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2.'' During prosecution, the patent examiner rejected the claim based on prior art disclosing a protein with an amino acid sequence similar to SEQ ID NO:2, such that it met part (b) of the definition. The applicant responded by amending the claim, replacing part (b) of the definition with a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence that is encoded by a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes with the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 (i.e., the E. coli YddG gene) under stringent conditions.'' This is the definition that appears in the issued patent claim. A competitor sought to design around the patent by introducing a non-E. coli YddG gene into E. coli, to achieve substantially the same functionality. The resulting recombinant strain was found to literally infringe the claim, because the non-E. coli gene was sufficiently similar to the E. coli gene that it would hybridize under stringent conditions, thus satisfying part (b) of the definition. But the competitor made a second recombinant strain that used redundant codon replacement to produce a gene that encoded the same non-E. coli YddG gene as the first strain, but due to the codon replacement the nucleotide sequence of the gene was sufficiently different from the E. coli gene that it would not hybridizes under stringent conditions, and thus did not satisfy part (b) (or part (a)) of the definition. This second strain was found to infringe under the doctrine of equivalents. The majority on the Federal Circuit panel found that, under the well-established function-way-result test, the non-E. coli protein is equivalent to the recited E. coli protein, and that prosecution history estoppel did not preclude the patent owner from relying on the doctrine of equivalents, because the rationale underlying the amendment [bore] no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question.'' Judge Dyk dissented from this aspect of the decision, finding the amendment of part (b) of the definition of E. coli YddG to bear more than a tangential relationship to the accused equivalent. This case is discussed in the Holman Report appearing in this edition of Biotechnology Law Report.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,1

The conditions for creating, using the results of intellectual activity and disposing of exclusive rights to them are rapidly changing, taking into account the intensive development of robotics, artificial intelligence, and the complexity of the Internet space. In his article, the author proposes to critically comprehend and analyze the history of copyright through the study of philosophical justifications, theoretical doctrines and to trace the main trends of the evolutionary path of development of this institution: from the granting of privileges to its complete denial in connection with the rapid development of the Internet and the emergence of free licenses.",2022,History,1
Creation of Technical Conditions for Use or Infringement - The Meanders of the Warehouse Keeper's Liability in Light of CJEU Judgment C-567/18 Coty Germany,Trademarks; Technical conditions for use or infringement; Stocking; Intermediary; Personal pursuit of aims; ,"One form of industrial property right infringement is stocking for the purpose of offering or marketing. This form of infringement appears both in EU legal acts on trademarks or designs, as well as in national regulations, including those concerning patents. What is specific to stocking when compared to other activities comprising the stipulated exclusivity of the holder of industrial property rights is the fact that the literal meaning of stocking does not explain whether the infringing party or the warehouse keeper is the entity that places the goods in storage. The structure of industrial property rights as absolute rights would theoretically permit the view that the law is violated by both the entity that accepts the goods for storage and the entity that places such goods in storage. To determine if there is an infringement, it must be established what the goods being stocked are further intended for. It is not without significance that the finding of an infringement of industrial property rights does not depend on fault or awareness. From the point of view of the industrial property law regime, it is difficult to find arguments against this understanding of infringement by stocking. Since the offeror of goods infringing industrial property rights may be held liable even if the goods have not yet been manufactured, it is conceivable that the entity accepting such goods for stocking is also liable. This interpretation of the concept of stocking would certainly correspond to the absolute nature of liability for infringement. In a recent judgment the CJEU confirmed that the warehouse keeper who, on behalf of a third party, stores goods which infringe trademark rights only creates the technical conditions for trademark use by this third party provided that the warehouse keeper is not aware of that infringement. The CJEU also confirmed that only the person who decides about the purpose of storing the goods can be treated as an infringer. However, the CJEU did not respond to the question regarding whether the warehouse keeper could be treated as an infringer if it pursues the aims of storing the goods at the request of the entity that put the goods into storage.",2021,Government & Law,1

Attuned to recent work on political ontology that takes contests over 'how the world is' as a starting point for navigating the degradation and uncertainty of life in the Anthropocene, we trace how two films released in 2016, Seed: The Untold Story and Food Evolution, weave different - though sometimes similar - accounts of the past in order to present precarious futures that are best served through particular interventions. To the extent that both films render accounts of precarious futures saved by science or conservation, we argue that they provide compelling spaces, following Isabelle Stengers's 'Cosmopolitical Proposal', to slow down: to pause and consider the types of worlds that are brought into being - and those that are foreclosed - in their portrayal of the crises of climate and food. We follow this worlding practice through four threads developed in each film: the momentum of apocalypse, the boundaries of the natural, the politics of law, and the cures for precarity. Focusing on the politics of representation mobilized in each film, we enact a feminist praxis of slowing down.",2020,"Cultural Studies; Communication; Film, Radio & Television",1
Personal data as pseudo-property: Between commodification and assetisation,Lifeworld; property; commodity; assets; monopoly capital; INTANGIBLE ASSETS; DATA JUSTICE; LABOR; WORK,"The paper discusses how personal data is a crucial resource in the digital age. It explores the complex nature of the economic valorisation of personal data. Recent discussions have focused on the commodification and profit generation from personal data and its role as an asset and a source of rent. Property rights play a significant but contradictory role in each of these cases. From a technical standpoint, personal data does not fall under traditional ownership rights protected by intellectual property laws. It is neither an artistic work covered by copyright nor an outcome of financial investment that could be protected by patents. Instead, the paper focuses on the role of personal data in the capitalist mode of production and digital monopoly conditions. It aims to analyse the successive transformations of everyday activities into machine-readable objects, de facto property, assets, and elements of monopoly capital.",2024,Communication,1
R&D subsidies in permissive and restrictive environment: Evidence from Korea,R&D subsidy; Regulatory environment; WTO subsidy rules; Innovations; Patent; Utility model; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; DEVELOPMENT POLICY; PROTECTION; LAWS; GOVERNMENT; TRADE; LESSONS; SYSTEM; IMPACT,"This paper investigates the extent to which a regulatory environment for R&D subsidies shapes the magnitude and direction of R&D subsidies set by a government and consequent innovation paths. When the WTO adopted a permissive regulatory environment, we find that the Korean government increased R&D subsidies significantly (89.21%) and selectively so for firms and industries with higher returns. Recipient firms conducted less basic research and more development research. Improvements in innovations were mostly incremental and minor. However, such changes did not persist once the WTO switched to a restrictive regulatory environment. Our findings show that the regulatory environment imposed by the WTO largely affects allocation of R&D subsidies and suggest that a permissive regulatory environment may not necessarily maximize the potential for breakthrough innovations.",2023,Business & Economics,1
First Nations Healing: From Traditional Medicine to Experimental Ethnopharmacology,; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; CANCER; RESISTANCE; PLANTS; PHARMACOGENOMICS; PERSPECTIVES; INHIBITION; THERAPY; TUMORS,"Focusing on First Nations traditional medicine, we investigated whether traditional knowledge of medicinal plants can be validated by modern scientific methods of molecular and cellular pharmacology and whether this information is of value for improving current therapy options. Based on two projects on medicinal plants of the Gwich'in - a First Nations group on the Canadian North West Coast - we found that extracts from several plants traditionally used medically were able to kill tumor cells, including otherwise multidrug-resistant cells. Investigating medicinal plants from Indigenous communities raises questions about ownership, appropriation, and commercial use. At the same time, because of the intricacies of patent law, publishing scientific investigations on medicinal herbs represents an effective way to prevent biopiracy. Therefore, research cooperation between industrialized and developing countries, and between Western and non-Western knowledge systems will facilitate ethically sound ethnopharmacological research and merge a diversity of competencies and knowledges.",2020,Literature,1

Based on 874 articles published in the core collection of Web of Science, this paper conducts an in-depth bibliometric and visual analysis in terms of literature distribution, cooperation network, co-citation, knowledge base, and research hotspots analysis. The results show that the number of annual publications has shown an approximate exponential growth in the past decades. The UK is the most critical node in cross-border cooperation. Alessandro Muscio, with 11 publications, and Henry Etzkowitz, with 793 citations, are the most prolific and cited authors respectively. Research Policy has the highest frequency of citations. The knowledge base of KTUIC includes UIC and knowledge transfer, basic theories of U-I relationships, university TTOs, Bayh-Dole Act and university patenting, and individuals in university technology transfer. Research hotspots mainly focus on the related issues of third mission and entrepreneurial universities. Additionally, we also propose the future research agenda of KTUIC from the perspective of five knowledge bases. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the development status and core issues in KTUIC, and offer valuable guidance for future research directions.",2024,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,1

This strategy has been applied to fight epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we still know little about the politics and governance that enable such arrangements, especially when there is no consent from the originator company. This study focuses on the case of Brazil, a country that is well-known for its health-industry policy, which includes the local production of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), a new treatment for hepatitis C. We seek to explain the factors that have contributed to Brazil's successful production of generic versions of DAAs, and, later, to the decision by the Ministry of Health (MoH) to procure drugs from multinational pharmaceutical companies rather than from local laboratories. A lack of support for domestic production by important stakeholders, the patent holder's attempt to block domestic production and the MoH's adoption of more modern treatment guidelines under a different procurement logic all created an unfavourable environment for local production and procurement of DAAs. Our study draws implications for middle-income countries that wish to produce drugs domestically without voluntary license agreements.",2024,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1

Based on a set of 59 AfT recipient-countries over the period 2002-2014, and using the negative binomial regressions approach, results show that total AfT flows exert a positive and significant effect on trademark applications. However, this positive effect is primarily driven by that of AfT for productive capacity building on trademark applications. The policy implication of these findings is that higher AfT inflows, in particular AfT flows for productive capacity building to recipient-countries would help trading firms submit a high number of trademarks applications, which would in turn contribute to promoting international trade in these countries.",2020,Business & Economics,1
Space-time evolution law of progressive failure area and mechanical behaviour of rock under different seepage conditions,Triaxial compression test; Seepage pressure; Digital image correlation; Progressive failure; Space -time evolution law; PERMEABILITY EVOLUTION; STRESS; DAMAGE; FRACTURE; DEFORMATION; COMPRESSION; SANDSTONE; PRESSURE,"In engineering geological disasters, the presence of water can accelerate rock mass fracture, and the state of the seepage field has a varying influence on the elastic behaviour of rock mass. A three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) system is used to conduct triaxial compression tests on sandstone under different seepage conditions. The variation law of rock mechanical behaviour and the space-time evolution law of the surface radial strain field in the progressive failure process are analysed. The results show that, as the seepage pressure increases, the rock peak stress decreases and the Young's modulus increases, and the mechanical properties of the rock are easily affected by the varying seepage conditions. Meanwhile, a constitutive equation based on the Gumbel distribution, which can accurately reflect the axial stress-strain relationship in the rock failure process is established. By analysing the spatial distribution of virtual data points with large radial strain values at different times on the sample surface, a patent strain localisation phenomenon is identified in the progressive failure process of the rock. The localisation degree and extent of the failure area can be quantified using the average nearest-neighbour analysis (ANNA) and user-defined parameter S, which is used to normalise the average distance from the virtual data points to the fitted fracture surface. The results show that, with the continuous compression of samples under different seepage conditions, ANN decreases as S increases, and the large strain regional distribution is increasingly concentrated. The research results can be applied to predict surrounding rock failure areas in underground spaces and provide monitoring references with respect to engineering geological disasters under different seepage conditions.",2023,Engineering; Geology,1
Major Trends in Today's Intelligent Robotics in Light of the Creation of Collaborative Artificial Intelligence,Innovation; patent; copyright; autonomous systems; technological processes.; ,"Robotics and advances in artificial intelligence are breakthrough innovations with considerable promise and the potential to radically change the economic and social aspects of society. Research on the development of robotics is still scarce. This article fills the gap by analyzing the creation and diffusion of robotics innovation and the role of intellectual property in this process. The robotics innovation ecosystem is based on cooperative networks of independent specialists, scientific organizations, and companies. The state plays a significant role in supporting the innovation activity in the considered sphere, first of all, through grant financing, placement of defense orders and implementation of national strategies of robotics development. Competitions and prizes are an important incentive for creating innovations. Patenting is used by companies to protect intellectual property from encroachment by third parties, to ensure freedom of action, to license technology, and to protect against prosecution. The industrial revolution has changed the very notion of means and means of production in the minds of the masses in such a way that the process of robotization and the introduction of artificial intelligence in different areas of life has become inevitable. The article presents an analysis of possible ways of disclosing the concept of artificial intelligence as a legal category and its correlation with the concept of robot, considers the issues of legal responsibility for the performance of work by artificial intelligence, studies the possibility of recognizing the holder of artificial intelligence work as a subject of law.",2023,Neurosciences & Neurology,1
Towards a model for determining patent revenue odds: An empirical study of technology transfer offices,human resource; intellectual property; revenue; technology transfer offices; university-industry technology transfer processes; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PERFORMANCE; COMMERCIALIZATION; INNOVATION; STRATEGY; IMPACT,"Technology transfer offices (TTO) were created with the mission of executing innovation policy and its technology transfer to industry. Most studies regarding TTO focus on the context of developed countries, so there is a lack of research on the subject in emerging economies, such as Brazil. In addition, the issue of how diverse the skills of the team of a given TTO should be for their best revenue performance is still little addressed. In this sense, the present study aims to identify which characteristics of the TTO, related to their human resources, influence obtaining revenue from the patents that constitute their portfolios. To achieve this objective, 272 TTO in Brazil were analysed with the help of the Logistic Regression technique, based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation. A remarkable conclusion that emerges from our results is that the universities to increase their revenue must invest in full-time employees (e.g., rather than in scholarship students, as tends to be the norm) and foster the inventions' communications, as well as to attract and retain employees with skills directly related to knowledge fields such as Law, Engineering, and Communication (quite surprisingly, Management and Economics graduates are not included). The combination of these factors can increase the probabilities or odds of a given TTO obtaining revenue. Thus, our results contribute to TTO human resource practices, especially those in structuring stages, such as those in Brazil and Latin American countries.",2023,Computer Science,1

Particularly, Fusobacterium nucleatum was confirmed to promote the proliferation and metastasis of CRC. Therefore, targeting F. nucleatum may be a potential preventive and therapeutic approach for CRC. Herein, 2,272 off-patent drugs were screened inhibitory activity against F. nucleatum. Among the hits, nitisinone was identified as a promising anti-F. nucleatum lead compound. Further optimization of nitisinone led to the discovery of more potent derivatives. Particularly, compounds 19q and 22c showed potent anti-F. nucleatum activity (MIC50 = 1 and 2 mu g/mL, respectively) with low cytotoxicity. Among them, compound 19q effectively attenuated the migratory ability of MC-38 cells induced by F. nucleatum. Preliminary mechanism studies suggested that nitisinone and its derivatives might act by downregulating nitroreductase and tryptophanase. Thus, the development of small molecule F. nucleatum inhibitors represents an effective strategy to treat CRC.",2023,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

We combine the annual survey data of Chinese industrial firms (ASIF), Chinese customs transactions and patent data to verify the theoretical propositions. The results report that: (1) there is a significantly positive correlation between the quality of imported intermediates and firms' markups; (2) innovation acts as a potential channel through which the quality of imported intermediates increases firms' markups; (3) by decomposing markups into the price channel and the cost channel, we find that the quality of imported intermediates affects firms' markups through the cost channel.

Using data from a sample of Indian universities, we identify university-specific publicly available organizational characteristics which, acting as signals, may reduce the information asymmetry problem and catalyze knowledge exchange (KE) partnerships. We find that strength of passive signals such as university ownership structure and reputation, and active ones such as volume of patents filed, impacts a university's KE performance positively. The impact of each signal is very KE channel specific, and the magnitude of this impact is large. We also find that signal strength negatively moderates the direct linkage between research and KE, implying that signaling is more relevant for universities where there is greater separation of its research outputs and KE performance.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Penelope: A Novel Prototype for In Situ Defect Removal in LPBF,; LASER; POWDER,"A new laser powder bed fusion prototype for in situ monitoring of defects and in situ and inline flaw removal has been developed at and patented by Politecnico di Milano (Italy). This prototype allows the identification of a defective layer thanks to an innovative in situ monitoring approach that combines image and video-image data in the visible and infrared ranges.When an alarm is issued, the layer containing the defect is removed in situ and inline, thanks to a novel self-repairing system acting as a grinder on the powder bed. After this removal step, subsequent layers are additively produced starting from the healed height. By comparing specimens obtained with and without such intermediate layer removal, the aim of this preliminary study is to investigate the feasibility of the methodology, revealing that no discontinuity is introduced into the part by the novel inline removal operation.

The study aims to analyse and determine which specific public support measures are needed by SMEs for acquiring and commercialising IPR and how to design such public support within the legal boundaries set under European Union (EU) laws. The theoretical framework used in this study is built around the social system as defi ned by Parsons. The 4S Model (based on scope, scale, skill and social networking) derived by researchers from the said social system is considered. Further, 19 key attributes were devised by the authors in conjunction with the role of motivation to form a revised framework. The analysis employs qualitative research methods. To apply the framework of social systems theory, the authors used semi-structured interviews as a method to study the public support measures required by Estonian stakeholders. This was also analysed in the framework of EU State aid law, which poses both restrictions and exemptions. This research presents several desired support measures. Although the public support systems for acquiring and commercialising IPR by SMEs are restrained by legal frameworks within the EU, the analysis of the relevant laws and cases shows that State aid for RDI purposes is legally permissible within the EU, depending on the state's willingness and availability of funds.",2021,Government & Law,1

What this methodology takes into account is the amplitude and frequency analyses discussed in the article, as well as a sensing system based on diverse piezoelectric and magnetic phenomena, the Doppler effect, etc. Both contact and non-contact (laser measurement) methods were used during the tests. The purpose of the tests conducted at the stand, originally designed by the authors in accordance with the methodology proposed, was to evidence that using the innovative and patented, highly torsionally flexible metal clutch makes it possible to reduce the vibrations of multi-stage toothed gears, consequently reducing the forces affecting the gear bearings and those acting at the tooth space, which is to enable the service life of individual components of the power transmission systems intended for mining scraper conveyors to be significantly extended. Based on the studies and analyses performed by the authors, one can observe and conclude that the methodology proposed in the paper makes it possible to use an example of a relatively complex power transmission system in order to examine the relationships between the processes at work, i.e., the decline of the linear vibrations of the gear housing (which is undoubtedly positive in power transmission systems) at the expense of increasing torsional vibrations of the innovative clutch, the latter not to be considered unfavourable to users in the case analysed.",2023,Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,1

The objective was to study the difference in the patency of coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures in Indian human adult skulls. Material and Methods: This study involved 120 Indian human adult skulls. The suture patency was graded in accordance to a classification proposed by Sabini and Elkowitz on a scale of 0-4. An open suture was classified as 0; fused but not obliterated as 1; and Grades 2, 3, and 4 represented <50%, >50%, and 100% of obliteration, respectively. Results: The lambdoid sutures were observed to be the most patent and least obliterated. Grade 1 sutures were observed to be 44.71% in lambdoid, 8.4% in sagittal, and 7.3% in coronal sutures. Grade 2 sutures were observed to be 42.6% in lambdoid, 49.3% in sagittal, and 46.7% in coronal sutures. Grade 3 sutures were observed to be 10.1% in lambdoid, 32.1% in sagittal, and 36.2% in coronal sutures. Grade 4 sutures were observed to be 2.6% in lambdoid, 10.2% in sagittal, and 9.8% in coronal sutures. No open sutures were observed. Discussion and Conclusion: Lambdoid sutures are more patent than coronal and sagittal sutures. This can be attributed to the presence of more muscular contractile forces acting on the lambdoid suture when compared with other sutures. The mechanisms involved in suture closure are complex and involve genetic and environmental factors, age, and tissue interactions. Therefore, more advanced research is essential for a clearer insight on this subject, which has immense clinical implications in neuroscience.",2020,Anatomy & Morphology,1
Technology business incubators in India: what determines their R&D contributions to the national economy?,TBIs; Technology; Entrepreneurship; Start-ups; Innovation; India; ,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore how do the characteristics of technology business incubators (TBIs), their chief executive officers, selection process and incubation process influence their research and development (R&D) contributions to the national economy. Design/methodology/approach These research questions are probed based on primary data gathered from 65 TBIs located in Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad, 3 of the leading start-up hubs of India comprising 9 accelerators, 31 incubators and 25 co-working spaces. Stepwise (backward elimination) regression method has been applied for six regression models for the analysis of research objectives. Findings Incubators more than accelerators and co-working spaces have incurred R&D investments for infrastructure development and hired exclusive R&D personnel. External networks and size of incubators in terms of number of incubatees are decisive for R&D investments and new products/services. TBIs accounted for a negligible share of patents relative to the number of new products/services generated in these TBIs, thereby indicating low level of novelty/innovativeness of new products/services. However, both new products/services and patent applications are crucial for revenue generation, implying that the generated new products/services are able to penetrate the market and patent application submission can act as a signal to the market. Research limitations/implications The overall research findings portend that there is scope and potential for an increasing R&D contribution to emerge from the TBIs along with their incubated start-ups, to supplement the national R&D efforts in India in the future. The emphasis, of course, has to be more on strengthening the innovation ecosystem through TBIs by means of industry-institute partnerships. Practical implications This study's practical implications refer to the need to promote TBIs as a means of strengthening regional innovation systems in developing economies. Social implications TBIs can be a means of nurturing tech start-ups for generating employment and income in regional economies. Originality/value This is a first of its kind study with reference to an emerging economy exploring to understand the extent of R&D contributions emerging from TBIs, which have been promoted on an increasing scale across the country as a means of nurturing technology start-ups.",2020,Business & Economics,1
The pivotal role of PFO in paradoxical embolism following venous sclerotherapy: a unique case report with pathological correlations,Case report; Patent foramen ovale; Percutaneous closure; Stroke; Paradoxical embolism; Syncope; Cerebrovascular accident; DIAGNOSIS,"Background Vein sclerosing therapy for varicose veins remains an extremely popular procedure. Cerebrovascular accidents can be a serious complication. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) can act as a conduit to the arterial circulation, which could explain the adverse neurologic consequence of this procedure. This case provides pathologic evidence of this concept. Case summary A 66-year-old female presented with syncope after undergoing varicose vein sclerotherapy. A computed tomography angiography of the head and neck in the emergency room revealed an occluded right distal M1 middle cerebral artery. Clot retrieval was performed with final pathology revealing amorphous material consistent with an exogenous agent, polidocanol foam, which was used for the patient's vein sclerotherapy. A transthoracic echocardiogram and transoesophageal echocardiogram showed a PFO, which was ultimately closed percutaneously. Discussion In a quarter of the population, lack of closure of the intrauterine interatrial shunt leads to the existence of a PFO. This direct communication between the atria provides an anatomical conduit for paradoxical emboli and eventually infarction of affected tissues. While a paradoxical embolism is an uncommon cause of acute arterial occlusion, it can have catastrophic sequelae. Historically, the presence of an arterial thrombus from the venous circulation has been difficult to establish unless the thrombus is visualized in transit through a PFO. Complications from vein sclerotherapy have been reported in the literature and include transient ischaemic attacks and strokes, however, this is the first case to provide pathological proof of a paradoxical embolism, which ultimately resulted in percutaneous closure of the PFO.",2021,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,1

The U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in Matal v. Tam and Iancu v. Brunetti allowed federal registration of disparaging, immoral, or scandalous trademarks. Appellee Simon Tam cheered, hoping that these decisions would usher in a new era of minority communities reappropriating harmful and offensive terms steeped in hate and prejudice. Others were less optimistic. Advocacy organizations, scholars, and others worried that these decisions opened the floodgates to the United States Patent and Trademark Office registering the vilest and most prejudicial terms in the U.S. lexicon to ossify hatred. Only time would tell who was right. Now, several years after Tam, this Article seeks to answer this question for LGBTQ+ slurs. A prior study found that affirming uses of racially-oriented marks by in-group members predominated over disparaging ones after Tam. This Article builds on that analysis and breaks ground on examining trademark law's relationship with LGBTQ+ persons. To date, practically no scholarship has examined the relationship between trademark law and the LGBTQ+ community. This Article presents a new empirical analysis of 144 LGBTQ+-oriented trademark applications filed before and after Tam. This study finds that the number of LGBTQ+-oriented trademark applications has increased over twofold since Tam. More surprisingly, LGBTQ+-oriented marks have been overwhelmingly affirming in nature; not a single disparaging use of the slurs in trademarks was identified over the entire nine-year period. Based on these findings, I posit that Tam and Brunetti have facilitated increasing applications for and registrations of LGBTQ+-oriented trademarks by and for the LGBTQ+ community rather than as symbols of hate against it.",2024,Government & Law,1

A dynamic model of price competition and promotion in prescription drug markets,Competitive pricing strategy; Pharmaceutical markets; Direct-to-consumer advertising; Detailing; Dynamic game; TESTS; INFORMATION; LEADERSHIP; CONSUMERS,"In prescription drug markets, the effects of advertising on demand for the drug category and for specific brands have been studied, and the interaction between price and non-price promotions, acting on demand for the drug, is well established. More recently, supply-side decisions such as competitive pricing strategies between rival firms in the same therapeutic category, and the interaction between them and consumer advertising have been examined. The study extends the research on the relationship between competitive pricing strategies and direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) by developing and estimating a dynamic model in which sales is influenced by a combination of consumer advertising, detailing, and pricing. The model is estimated using US data from two medical therapeutic categories. One of these datasets has been used in estimation of a static model in a recently published study, and we compare the results of our dynamic model with the static model results. A dynamic model is appropriate for a market where there is a limited period and planning horizon for recovering the costs of drug development before a branded prescription drug loses its patent protection. The relationship between DTCA, detailing, and pricing under different competitive strategies is examined empirically. It is found that the dynamic model can contradict a basic conclusion of a static model, regarding mode of competitive pricing behavior. The relationship between amount and type of DTCA and competitive pricing strategy is as found in previous studies. There are implications for the marketing of pharmaceutical brands during their period of patent protection.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Effect of right-to-left shunt on youth benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: A prospective clinical study,Youth benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; Right to left shunt; Anti-platelet treatment; Patent foramen ovale; PATENT FORAMEN OVALE; MIGRAINE; PREVALENCE; FEATURES; STROKE; HEART,"Objective: To evaluate the correlation between right to left shunt (RLS) and youth benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (YBPPV). Patients and methods: Patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and normal control cases younger than 45 years were enrolled at 1:1 ratio. Contrast-enhanced transcranial doppler ultrasound was performed to determine the existence and shunt grading of RLS. Regression analysis was conducted by including other possible risk factors for YBPPV to evaluate whether RLS acts as an independent risk factor. Results: A total of 174 cases were enrolled, with 87 cases in the YBPPV group and 87 cases in the normal control group. The proportion of existing RLS in the YBPPV group was significantly higher than in the normal control group (65.52% vs. 28.74%, P < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that RLS was an independent risk factor for YBPPV (odds ratio = 2.157, 95% credibility interval: 1.504 similar to 3.093, P<0.001). In the YBPPV group, the recurrence of BPPV within 180 days showed no statistical difference between cases with RLS and receiving antiplatelet treatment and cases with RLS and without anti-platelet treatment. In the YBPPV group, the recurrence of BPPV within 180 days in cases without RLS and anti-platelet treatment did not significantly differ from cases with RLS and without anti-platelet treatment and cases with RLS and receiving anti-platelet treatment. Conclusion: In the present study, RLS resulted as an independent risk factor for YBPPV. This observation could generate hypotheses of the mechanism by which a RLS could induce YBPPV.",2021,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,1
A Network Pharmacology Study to Uncover the Multiple Molecular Mechanism of the Chinese Patent Medicine Toujiequwen Granules in the Treatment of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),Toujiequwen granules; COVID-19; network pharmacology; target; molecular mechanism; INFECTION; SPIKE,"Since the outbreak of the novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the end of 2019, specific antiviral drugs have been lacking. A Chinese patent medicine Toujiequwen granules has been promoted in the treatment of COVID-19. The present study was designed to reveal the molecular mechanism of Toujiequwen granules against COVID-19. A network pharmacological method was applied to screen the main active ingredients of Toujiequwen granules. Network analysis of 149 active ingredients and 330 drug targets showed the most active ingredient interacting with many drug targets is quercetin. Drug targets most affected by the active ingredients were PTGS2, PTGS1, and DPP4. Drug target disease enrichment analysis showed drug targets were significantly enriched in cardiovascular diseases and digestive tract diseases. An active ingredient-target-disease network showed that 57 active ingredients from Toujiequwen granules interacted with 15 key targets of COVID-19. There were 53 ingredients that could act on DPP4, suggesting that DPP4 may become a potential new key target for the treatment of COVID-19. GO analysis results showed that key targets were mainly enriched in the cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cytokine activity and other functions. KEGG analysis showed they were mainly concentrated in viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptors and endocrine resistance pathway. The evidence suggests that Toujiequwen granules might play an effective role by improving the symptoms of underlying diseases in patients with COVID-19 and multi-target interventions against multiple signaling pathways related to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",2021,Research & Experimental Medicine,1

The 3CL protease (3CLpro) is a highly conserved protease which is indispensable for CoVs replication, and is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this study we investigated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of Shuanghuanglian preparation, a Chinese traditional patent medicine with a long history for treating respiratory tract infection in China. We showed that either the oral liquid of Shuanghuanglian, the lyophilized powder of Shuanghuanglian for injection or their bioactive components dose-dependently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro as well as the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. Baicalin and baicalein, two ingredients of Shuanghuanglian, were characterized as the first noncovalent, nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography was distinctly different from those of known 3CLpro inhibitors. Baicalein was productively ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a shield in front of the catalytic dyad to effectively prevent substrate access to the catalytic dyad within the active site. Overall, this study provides an example for exploring the in vitro potency of Chinese traditional patent medicines and effectively identifying bioactive ingredients toward a specific target, and gains evidence supporting the in vivo studies of Shuanghuanglian oral liquid as well as two natural products for COVID-19 treatment.",2020,Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

The institution of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is a case in point, where various trade treaties have persuaded countries to homogenize the IPR laws, purportedly, to boost technological change and innovation. Such enthusiasm to homogenize the international policy space, however, is often at odds with the conjectures made by the scholars on institutions, who suggest that transfer of institutions across societies are burdened with problems of incompatibilities with other existing institutions, social values and historical, country-specific contingencies. Moreover, academic scholarship is divided on the relationship between IPR and innovations. This paper uses cross-country simultaneous equation estimations to analyze the two-way relationships between IPR, its underlying social values, historical-political contingencies, and innovation. Taking into consideration both technological and non-technological innovation, our results suggest that the impact of IPR on innovation dynamics of a country is neither one-way nor linear. Besides, various social values and historical contingencies seem to have a complex relationship with, and consequence on, the dynamics of innovation and IPR. The results suggest the need for interlinking development policies with the policies for innovations.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Integrating thermodynamics towards bulk level synthesis of nano Ni catalysts: a green mediated sol-gel auto combustion method,; NICKEL NANOPARTICLES; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; GRAPHENE OXIDE; REDUCTION; 4-NITROPHENOL; DEGRADATION; EXTRACT; CITRATE,"While there are several metal nanocatalysts in hydrogenation reactions, the synthesis and research study of nano nickel are particularly intriguing due to this transition metal's magnetically separable nature. A novel approach for the massive production of nickel nanoparticles has been introduced by integrating a green medium into the conventional sol-gel auto combustion process (IN patent no. 360528). Lemon juice serves the purpose of the green medium, which acts as a solvent and reducing agent for the formation of nickel nanoparticles in solid form. The Ellingham diagram-based thermodynamics of metal oxide was attempted to explain the formation of metal nanoparticles over the metal oxide nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to optimise the reaction conditions for the formation of precise metal nanoparticles. The structure, morphology, and purity of the synthesised materials were investigated using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques. TEM analysis revealed a spherical morphology of nickel nanoparticles with an average particle size of 8.2 nm. Vibrating ample magnetometer data established the ferromagnetic character of the sample. Nanoparticles were found to be an effective catalyst for the reduction of p-nitrophenol and degradation of rhodamine with sodium borohydride acting as a reducing agent. This particular method of synthesis can pave the way for the solid-state production of crystalline nickel nanoparticles with excellent catalytic efficiency.",2023,Chemistry,1
Mapping the New Frontier of International IP Law: Introducing a TRIPs-plus Dataset,intellectual property; TRIPS; patent; copyright; preferential trade agreements; Bilateralism; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; FREE-TRADE AGREEMENTS; VETO PLAYERS; ACCESS; PROVISIONS; INNOVATION; DESIGN,"This article introduces a new dataset on the intellectual property (IP) provisions included in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) and makes it available for research and policy communities alike. Several PTAs include IP commitments that go well beyond the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs). A sound knowledge of these TRIPs-plus commitments is essential in order to improve our understanding of what drives them and of their legal, social, and economic consequences. Yet, until now, these provisions have not been mapped in a comprehensive and systematic way. The T + PTA dataset fills this gap by documenting the existence of 90 types of IP provisions in 126 agreements signed between 1991 and 2016. We show that, even for like-minded countries, significant variations exist in their reliance on TRIPs-plus provisions, their degree of consistency across PTAs, and their preferences for some IP rights. We also find that strong TRIPs-Plus provisions are correlated with the depth of PTAs, the asymmetry between trade partners, and the strength of their domestic IP law. By making the T + PTA dataset available, we hope to create the opportunity for a new generation of research on TRIPs-plus agreements.",2020,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,1

Although inventors have patented these controversial objects since the beginning of the Women's Movement, in 2010, anti-rape technology began to receive global media attention as the new wave in self-defense. While proponents of women's physical self-defense argue corporeal techniques, such as martial arts and boxing, empower women by disrupting traditional gender norms, inventors embrace a post-feminist sensibility arguing technology-facilitated rape-prevention is more effective because passive prevention is in-line with traditional gender norms. This article constructs a genealogy of anti-rape technology using international patent and historical records from 1850 to 2016. This analysis reveals that inventors subscribe to what I term techno-physical feminismor strategies that utilize technoscience to seemingly transform the wearer's psychology, corporeal resilience, and agency. Technophysical feminism draws on Judy Wajcman's articulation of technofeminism and Martha McCaughey's physical feminism to analyze the material and discursive relationships between gender regulation, bodies, and technology. While there could be more liberatory designs of techno-physical feminism, I argue this iteration of wearable anti-rape technology reinforces traditional gender ideologies and re-inscribes feminine bodies as passive. This analysis also finds that although popular media accounts frame anti-rape technology as novel, these objects are derived from historical chastity technologies designed to promote normative masculinity. This research illuminates how technology has long been invoked to respond to shifting and gendered paradigms of sexual risk and contributes to conversations about gender, power, and corporeal surveillance.",2020,Communication; Women's Studies,1
Intellectual property on forecasting and profiling models,Intellectual property; copyright; patent; forecasting model; profiling model; property artificial intelligence; big data; open data; database; data; derivative work; ,"Forecasting and profiling models have become an important player in today's market and are undoubtedly part of the broader genus of artificial intelligence systems, as also confirmed by the recent definitions provided by the European legislator. Since they are complex intellectual creations that require high skills and huge investments, it is important to reflect on their protection in terms of so-called intellectual property. This article provides a general overview of forecasting/profiling models from a legal point of view, proceeding by assimilation to the various forms of intellectual creation already codified by IP law. It then goes on to identify the exclusive rights that come into play, with the relative owners and limits of application. Finally, a series of scenarios are described to better understand (and therefore legally contextualize) the derivation relationships between the information provided to a model (input), the output information and the model itself, also mentioning the case of open data.",2021,Philosophy,1

But there are few researches on it. In this research, a rapid separation and identification method using UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS was established, and 228 identified compounds were separated within 18 min. The structures of compounds were preliminarily determined by comparing the retention time and fragmentation law. Furthermore, multiple databases were used to integrate the compound targets of BLMC and the disease targets related to insomnia. After the intersection of the two sets of targets, a protein-protein interaction network and a drug-target-disease pharmacological network were established, then using the DAVID database to perform GO analysis and KEGG analysis on the common targets to find related pathways. Finally, a total of 289 common targets and 136 pathways were found to participate in the mechanism.",2022,Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Convergence Success and the Middle-Income Trap,Economic growth; Convergence; Middle-income trap; ECONOMIC-GROWTH,"This paper investigates the economic growth experiences of middle-income economies over the period 1960-2014 focusing on two groups of countries. The convergence success group includes middle-income economies which have graduated to a high-income status or have achieved rapid convergence progress. When an economy in the nonsuccess group experienced growth deceleration and failed to advance to a high-income status, we defined such episodes as the middle-income trap. We observe no clear pattern that the relative frequency of growth deceleration was higher for upper middle-income economies, thereby refuting the middle-income trap hypothesis. The probit regressions show that convergence successes tend to maintain strong human capital, a high working-age population ratio, effective rule of law, low-priced investment goods, and high levels of high-tech exports and patents. Adding to unfavorable demographic, trade, and technological factors, rapid investment expansion, hasty deregulation, and hurried financial opening could cause the nonsuccesses to fall into the middle-income trap.",2020,Development Studies; Business & Economics,1

Our experimental design is based on an unanticipated court ruling that reduces the risk of shareholder class action lawsuits for firms located within the jurisdiction of the US Ninth Circuit. Innovation output by firms headquartered in this area increased significantly after this decision compared with that of firms elsewhere. This result is consistent with our trading hypothesis, which states that the threat of litigation leads to managerial myopia. The increase in innovation is more pronounced at high-tech firms and firms operating in a competitive environment. Other measures of ex ante litigation risk indicate that firms with the greatest litigation risk experience the greatest increase in innovation after this decision. We conclude that a reduction in the threat of class action litigation leads firms to increase innovation.",2021,Business & Economics,1

The results of the difference -in-differences estimation show that the CEPI has a long-term positive effect on corporate green innovation in the form of green patents. The CEPI influences corporate green innovation through legitimacy pressure and value-enhancing corporate risk-taking. The positive effect is more pro-nounced in the provinces which are relatively more developed and less dependent on the sec-ondary industry. Moreover, this effect is primarily driven by overcompliance motive and is visible in firms with better internal governance, state-controlled firms, and firms with political con-nections. Our findings demonstrate the impact of campaign-style central supervision on corporate innovation policy.",2023,Business & Economics,1

It is reported that major customers positively impact corporate green innovation, indicating that firms have more incentives to engage in innovative green practices to maintain stable relationships with major customers. In addition, the positive relationship between customer concentration and green innovation is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises, firms located in the provinces with a high level of marketization, and after China's new Environmental Protection Law implementation. Moreover, we observe that the positive impact of customer concentration on corporate green innovation is more significant among industrial firms and firms operating in heavily polluting industries. Furthermore, industrial competition is an essential channel for major customers to affect corporate green innovation.",2023,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

We hypothesize that, because conservative auditors constrain income-increasing accounting discretion, managers may sacrifice long-term investments in innovation to boost current earnings and meet short-term performance targets. Exploiting state-level auditor legal liability shocks as a means of identification, we find evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Cross-sectional analyses reveal that the negative effect of increased auditor conservatism on corporate innovation is more pronounced when the client firms are under greater equity- and debt-market pressures, when the client firms are exposed to greater litigation risk, and when the client firms are audited by large auditors. Our study highlights how auditors, as external monitors, can affect not only the financial reporting quality of their clients but may also induce alterations in their real operations.",2021,Business & Economics,1

Traditional and emerging industries are willing to adopt it to nurture their innovation activities and achieve competitive advantage. However, traditional technological innovation theory cannot give accurate guidance because of the peculiarities of disruptive technology. Thus, in this study, we explore the diffusion mechanism of radio-frequency identification (RFID) technological innovation from the perspective of disruptive innovation. We implement maximum likelihood fitting methods and the goodness-of-fit test to analyse the network's degree distribution characteristics through evolution. Results illustrate that the connection mechanism changes through the evolution process. In particular periods, preferential attachment does not work. Dominant technologies will lose their position with the emergence of disruptive technologies, hence replaced by them. The findings will provide practical suggestions to firms in facilitating their strategic decision-making when faced with disruptive technologies.",2024,Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Fault Tolerance for Corporate Innovation: Evidence from the Reform of State-owned Enterprises,fault tolerance; corporate innovation; incentive mechanism; state-owned enterprise reform; quasi-natural experiment; BANKRUPTCY; LIFE; INCENTIVES; BANKS; LAWS; BAD,"Innovation is the source of power for high-quality development, and a relaxed institutional arrangement is a necessity for promoting innovation in enterprises. This paper examines the impact of fault tolerance on corporate innovation, theoretically analyzes the positive effects of fault tolerance on stimulating innovation, and estimates the influence of fault tolerance on corporate innovation by using the panel data of listed manufacturing companies from 2007 to 2019, taking the quasi-natural experiment of fault-tolerance system in various places since the new round of state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform. This study finds that the fault-tolerance system has significantly improved the R&D investment and patent application of the pilot SOEs, but the incentive effect is mainly reflected in the utility model patents; fault-tolerance system mainly promotes corporate innovation by alleviating managers' career worries and improving governance ability. Furthermore, the fault-tolerance system is more effective for small and medium-sized SOEs with low market competition and can alleviate the restriction of agency cost on corporate innovation. In addition, the fault-tolerance system has not yet had a significant spillover effect on private enterprises. These results show that in the SOE reform, it is necessary to strengthen the institutional arrangement of fault tolerance and create a relaxed environment to encourage innovation; it is necessary to organically integrate fault-tolerance -system design into executive measurement and corporate governance, promote fault -tolerant system to be implemented in a wider range of enterprises, and enhance the incentive effect on high-quality innovation.",2023,Business & Economics,1
The multidimensional legal nature of personal genomic sequence data: A South African perspective,data; human genome; intellectual property; ownership; privacy; property; PRIVACY,"This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the various dimensions in South African law applicable to personal genomic sequence data. This analysis includes property rights, personality rights, and intellectual property rights. Importantly, the under-investigated question of whether personal genomic sequence data are capable of being owned is investigated and answered affirmatively. In addition to being susceptible of ownership, personal genomic sequence data are also the object of data subjects' personality rights, and can also be the object of intellectual property rights: whether on their own qua trade secret or as part of a patented invention or copyrighted dataset. It is shown that personality rights constrain ownership rights, while the exploitation of intellectual property rights is constrained by both personality rights and ownership rights. All of these rights applicable to personal genomic sequence data should be acknowledged and harmonized for such data to be used effectively.",2022,Genetics & Heredity,1
The White Knight's Inventions: Creativity and Invention in Through the Looking-Glass,artist; invention; mechanics; nonsense; science; White Knight; ALICES,"The figure of the White Knight in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass has often been read as part of a tradition of nonsense literature. While this is true, I wish to extend that argument and locate the figure of the White Knight in the context of the debates around the Patent Law of 1852. While defining and recognising the role of mechanical labour, the role and function of artistic labour also featured in these debates. The White Knight's inventions are deeply resonant with these debates and prompt us to ask: what is the role of the artist in an industrial society? How can art retain its autonomy and justify itself when confronted with the pervasive discourse of utilitarianism? This paper argues that the anxiety around the role of the artist is palpable in the figure of the White Knight, and through him Carroll enunciates what may be read as his intervention in this debate.",2020,Literature,1

It is an everyday fact of life that huge percentage of offence are committed all over the world, it's a sensation issue and challenge for prevention and protection. White collar crime is a crime committed by the people of reputable group and high social status during the course of their occupation through misrepresentation, fraudulent advertisements, infringement of patents, copy rights and trademarks etc with a view to earn huge profits these criminal practices are very common to trade, commerce, education, health etc. Law Commission of India had suggested many changes in the statutes dealing with socio-economic offences, so as to make the punishments more stringent for punishing the socio-economic offenders. Subsequently the 47th Law Commission Report identified new composite three basic forms of socio-economic offences as first of all an Illegal Economic Activities, Secondly a Illegal way of performing commercial and allied transaction, Thirdly, if an Evasion of public taxes or monetary liabilities. all white collar crimes can be socio-economic offences but not all socio-economic offences can be termed as white collar crimes. All type of crimes are rampant inside the society.

Following a property rights approach it is postulated that formal and informal institutional arrangements influence how IP regimes affect the transaction costs and risk associated with converting ownership rights over IP into economic rights. Informal institutions are considered to affect the behaviour of agents involved in enforcing legal rights. This behaviour influences how IP law is implemented in legal arenas and thereby impacts on the efficacy of IPR regimes to help secure economic rights from the use of IP assets. Using data on outward FDI from the USA to 42 host countries the results find that the strength of informal institutions connected to the enforcement of IP in a country directly affects outcomes and positively moderates the effect of formal legal aspects of IP law on FDI flows. The results highlight the importance of informal institutional aspects connected to the behaviour of enforcement agents when using national legal systems to protect IP rights in cross frontier transactions.,2020,Business & Economics,1

Attempting to detect factors that could strengthen (or weaken) the impact of R & D entrepreneurship on innovation performance, I examine the moderating role of three important R & D strategies, namely the knowledge plurality, internal focus, and R & D collaboration. I empirically test the hypotheses developed in this study on secondary, longitudinal economic and patent data from a sample of 139 firms from the industries of pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and chemicals for a 7-year period, using fixed-effects negative binomial regression models. Findings support that the relationship between R & D entrepreneurship and innovation performance is positively moderated by knowledge plurality but negatively by internal focus and R & D collaboration.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Regulatory Requirements for Quality Control of Unani Medicines,; ,"Compliance with pharmacopeial standards is mandatory to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines. In India, allopathy, Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and homeopathy are the recognized systems of medicine and come under the provisions of different regulations. Promulgation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and the rules thereunder provide a regulatory framework for medicines of all of these systems and also prescribe Pharmacopoeia and Formularies for regulatory quality standards. Unlike in many other countries, the Act prescribes independent pharmacopeias for each system of medicine. The Unani Pharmacopoeia of India (UPI) and the National Formulary of Unani Medicine are the regulatory compendia for quality standards and manufacturing of Unani medicines, respectively. The Pharmacopoeia consists of Part I (single drugs) and Part II (formulations). Unani medicines are presented as classical or patent and proprietary formulations prepared using single ingredients or multiple ingredients of plant, animal, mineral, and/or metal origin. UPI Part I is published in six volumes comprising 298 monographs on Unani drugs derived from plants (single drugs). Part II is published in three volumes encompassing formulations, standard operating procedures, and quality standards for 150 classical formulations of Unani medicines, which are chosen from the National Formularies of Unani Medicine. The National Formulary of Unani Medicine is published in six parts comprising 1229 formulations of Unani medicines. Each monograph of the Pharmacopoeia provides specific analytical parameters and limits (standards) to ensure the quality of drugs or medicines. This communication reviews the UPI, the National Formulary of Unani Medicine, regulatory quality standards (parameters), and analytical techniques adopted for pharmacopeial standards of Unani drugs and medicines.",2020,Chemistry; Food Science & Technology,1
Of Horses and Jockeys: Perceptions by Academic Entrepreneurs,academic entrepreneurship; cognitive processes; individual motives; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVER THEORY; BAYH-DOLE ACT; SELF-EFFICACY; UNIVERSITIES GENERATE; GROWTH INTENTIONS; CAREER REASONS; FIRM GROWTH; SCIENTISTS; IMPACT; TECHNOLOGY,"Although there has been increasing recent interest in universities as ecosystems for the encouragement of academic entrepreneurship, almost none of that work has dealt with the specific personal motives that might lead academic scientists to start companies. Metaphorically, there has been a substantial body of work describing how to create a better racetrack, some study of what sort of horses best perform in the track, but essentially no examination of the jockeys. We address this gap in the literature in two ways - first by importing a variety of psychological characteristics that have been shown to be predictive in the larger entrepreneurship literature, and second by developing a series of context-specific motives. Our study of 50 biomedical scientists in an academic medical center showed, unsurprisingly, that patents matter. More importantly, although the results for the imported psychological characteristics were disappointing, the findings for context-specific motives suggest that founders are distinguished from non-founders primarily by their interest in doing something positive for humanity.",2020,Business & Economics,1

An hydroxytyrosol enriched extract from olive mill wastewaters exerts antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity on Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi and Agrobacterium tumefaciens,Olea europaea; phenols extraction; hydroxytyrosol; olive mill wastewaters; Pseudomonas savastanoi pv; Savastanoi; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; antimicrobial activity; POLYPHENOLS; DERIVATIVES; DISEASE; MODEL,"An hydroxytyrosol (HTyr) enriched extract (HTE), obtained from olive mill wastewaters (OMWW) through an eco-friendly, patented process was tested on two olive tree pathogens, Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi (Pss) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At). Pss, in particular, is a feared treat for olive tree cultivation being the etiological agent of the olive knot disease responsible of severe production losses. Chemical characterization allowed to identify and quantify HTyr as the main constituent along with other low molecular weight phenols. HTE has proven potent antioxidant activity and significant antimicrobial activity against Pss and At in vitro, in both cases higher than hydroxytyrosol alone, suggesting an important role also of the minor phenolic components, which act synergistically with HTyr.

Dysfunctional Regulations and Ineffective Implementation of Intellectual Property Rights - Based Banking Collateral: A Critical Analytical Study,"Intangible Business Capital; Intellectual Property-Based Banking Collateral, and Double Cover Binding Method; ","This research carried out a critical analytical study of Intellectual Property Rights - IPRs (focused on Copyright, Patent, and Trademark) as important industrial and commercial property also as business capital. By conducting juridical normative methods with descriptive explanatory research, this research started with inevitable facts concerning the effect and further potential of IPRs assets in a business. However, although proved to have high economic visibility, the pledging of these IPRs asset as banking collateral may lead to some difficulties and challenges, in the terms of IPRs assets or the law applicable to its pledge process and the implementation mechanism in practical scope. The result shows IPRs - Based Banking Collateral becomes ineffective caused by dysfunctional regulations as domestic law failed to provide harmonious ground to implement the IPRs Based Collateral. The main challenge lies in harmonization and the development of relevant implementing regulations. We suggest a double cover mechanism for IPRs based collateral binding. This method expects to solve the practical problems and provide better access to funding for intellectual capital-based - businesses, also the safety and guarantee for the banking institution in implementing prudential banking principles. This Double Cover Method also creates massive opportunities for IPRs - Based Collateral in creating a weightless economy with high potential economic growth.

Research on the Mechanism of China's Energy Saving and Emission Reduction Policy on Green Innovation in Enterprises,energy saving and emission reduction; green patents; heavy pollution; DID; innovation; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATIONS; PORTER HYPOTHESIS; PRODUCTIVITY; TRADE; FIRMS; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; COST,"China's extensive growth since reforming and opening its economy has led to increased pollution, and under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Chinese companies must initiate green innovation to meet the world trend and enhance their international competitiveness. In addition, with institutional and cultural differences, policy drive is a key focus of China's development. Therefore, China's Energy Saving and Emission Reduction policy has its own necessity and characteristics as a mechanism for green innovation in enterprises. This study examines the impact of the 13th Five-Year Plan on green innovation from the perspective of the Energy Saving and Emission Reduction policy. First, the data of 100 listed enterprises in two control zones (TCZ) and non-two-control zones (non-TCZ) from 2014 to 2019 were selected to identify whether the implementation of the policy has an impact on the innovation of heavily polluting enterprises using the double-difference method (DID). The study found that the 13th Five-Year Plan for Energy Saving and Emission Reduction had a negative impact on the innovation of heavily polluting enterprises. Further, the study found that the policy had a negative impact on enterprises' innovation through the transmission channel of increasing the environmental cost of enterprises, thus reducing investment in research and development (R&D). It is suggested that the state should start with the policy itself, identify its precise target, and formulate flexible environmental regulation policies.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Supplementary protection of intellectual property rights for medicines,; COMPETITION,"Volynets I.P., Dorozhko G.K., Petrenko V.O., Belitsky V.V. The article discusses the issue of extending the legal protection of intellectual property rights for medicines. The research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the problems related to the implementation of Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) in national legislation and possible solutions. The study also seeks to draw conclusions and make proposals for improving the regulatory framework for the SPCs of medicines. The work utilizes general scientific and specialized methods of scientific cognition, including dialectical, formal-logical, systemic structural, comparative legal, as well as modeling, analysis, and synthesis methods, which collectively contributed to the organization, planning, and conduct of the research. The study is based on scientific publications from databases and search systems (PubMed, JAMA, Scopus, Springer, BMC, Oxford Academic), international and national regulatory acts, statistical studies by international organizations (Precedence Research), patents for inventions related to medicines, recommendations by national government bodies, as well as prescriptions and guidelines from international and national experts. Considering the analysis of statistical data on the development and implementation of medicines, it has been determined that original biological medicines are a major factor in the rising prices of treating conditions such as diabetes, oncological diseases, and others. Examples of patents for medicines owned by global pharmaceutical companies (Gilead, Bayer Intellectual Property Gmbh, etc.) that have ensured their commercial success and competitive advantages are examined. It has been established that patent protection provides the right holder with the opportunity to maintain a monopoly in the market, thereby compensating for the time spent on the development and research of original medicinal products. Legislative approaches to regulating relationships concerning the supplementary protection of inventions related to medicines in the form of SPCs in Ukraine and the EU are identified. The exclusivity periods for regulatory data protection for medicines in the EU are outlined. Based on the conducted research, it is concluded that the application of the SPC mechanism is a tool to achieve a balance between the protection of intellectual property rights and access to original medicines. Timely entry of generics and biosimilars to the market contributes to reducing market prices but negatively impacts the profitability of manufacturers of original medicines. Attention is drawn to problematic aspects of the legislative implementation of the SPC mechanism in Ukraine, which leads to incorrect interpretation and implementation of relevant provisions and necessitates updating. In light of the aforementioned, there is an urgent need in Ukraine to implement, update, and improve the legislative mechanism for regulating SPCs.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,1
Effects of innovation and insurance coverage on price elasticity of demand for prescription drugs: some empirical lessons in pharmacoeconomics,Drug innovation; drug pricing; healthcare spending; insurance coverage; price elasticity; risk; ,"Aim:Prescription drug prices in the United States are considered rather extreme. Americans spend over $460 billion on drugs annually, or almost 17 percent of total national healthcare spending. How innovation incentives and insurance coverage drive pricing, diffusion, and utilization of drugs, under conditions of risk and competition, are multi-dimensional issues in medical economics that remain under-explored in the current empirical literature. We seek to address these issues in reviewing relevant studies presented at the 2020 AEA-ASSA annual convention.* Approach:Drawn from the 2020 convention panel sessions devoted to health economics, empirical evidence was thematically analyzed for charted new research terrains and trajectories. Their theoretical and practical implications on efficiency, effectiveness, and value in drug production and consumption were then identified. Findings:With certain qualifications, evidence confirms price inelasticity of prescription drugs and medical treatments, along with substitution effects from high or continuously rising prices. While health insurance inducesex antemoral hazard, albeit on a larger scale than previously considered, losing dependent coverage can incentivize price-substitution to risky and illegal drugs, including those sold on the black market. At the firm level, drug patenting and exclusivity rights suggest that innovation incentives increase new or novel clinical trials and generic utilization to a considerable extent. But innovation can produce strong, offsetting effects. It can distort competition and cause (at times sharp) price increases from product-hopping, (compensatory) list pricing, industry mergers and acquisitions, and capture of positive spillovers by competitors, rather than by focal developers, in follow-on innovations. In fine, there remains room for opportunism among firms, particularly market incumbents, and many loopholes are unplugged by U.S. healthcare reform. These make drug utilization costly to the insured, and risky to those who are - or become - uninsured or underinsured for various reasons. Conclusions:The fundamental disconnect between innovation cost and drug pricing demands public attention and policy intervention, which have proved largely elusive to date. Gaming the system in the name of scientific invention and discovery to reap additional benefits, at the expense of consumer health and income, brings to question the offsetting benefits of firm innovation. It also raises separate issues of fairness and equity. Innovation needs to be considered from the perspective of value lines and beyond conventional marketing incentives to drug utilization, with or without insurance coverage. Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses figure prominently under a value-based system of resource allocation, insurance, medical prescription, purchasing, and reimbursement.",2020,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine,1
Complementary components and returns from coordination within ecosystems via standard setting,complementary components; coordination; disclosure; ecosystems; standard setting; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; TRANSACTION COSTS; INNOVATION ECOSYSTEMS; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; COMPETITION; ECONOMICS,"Research Summary When and how does a firm generate positive returns for itself as it coordinates technological development in ecosystems via standard setting? We depart from the convention of examining a firm's disclosed standard essential patents (SEPs), to instead focus on its nondisclosed complementary components. Using data from the information and communication technology industry from 1988 to 2010, we demonstrate that a firm that discloses SEPs generates higher returns when it has more nondisclosed complementary components, especially when they are firm-specific. We further demonstrate the mechanism by showing at a component level that disclosure raises the value of nondisclosed complementary components. Findings suggest that adopting a systemic perspective over the firm's entire portfolio to include its complementary components provides a more comprehensive understanding of returns from coordination within ecosystems. Managerial Summary Compatibility standards provide the blue print behind the core technological platform in many ecosystems. During the standard setting process, firms disclose their ownership of intellectual property essential for the standard to function (SEPs). We study when such disclosures benefit the firm by examining the change in firms' equity market valuations. We find that firms generate positive returns when they own nondisclosed components that are complementary to their disclosed SEPs. We also find that the nondisclosed complementary components increase in value after the disclosure of SEPs. Our findings point to how managers can leverage standard setting to create and capture value in their technology portfolio beyond the licensing of SEPs.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Optimal pricing policy design for selling cost-reducing innovation in Cournot games,Cournot markets; Optimal pricing policy; Patent licensing; Nash equilibrium; Dominant strategy; PATENTS; DEMAND; FEE,"In a marketplace where a number of firms produce and sell a homogeneous product, an innovator develops cost-cutting manufacturing technology and decides to sell it to various firms in the form of a license for profit. Given the innovator's license pricing policy, each firm independently decides whether to purchase the innovation license and how many products to produce. To put it simply, the firms are then in a Cournot market in which the product price is a decreasing function of the total amount of the product on the market. Both the innovator and the firms are acting out of self-interest and look to maximize their utilities. We consider the problem of designing optimal pricing policies for the innovator. A pricing policy could be in the form of a one-off upfront fee, a per-unit royalty fee, or a hybrid of both. Building upon the results of Segal [1], we first show that in a properly designed pricing policy, it is a strictly dominant strategy for the firms to accept the pricing policy, and that this constitutes the unique Nash equilibrium of the game. For the hybridfee policy, we devise an algorithm that computes the optimal price in time O (n3), where n is the number of firms. For the royalty-fee policy, we show that the problem is captured by convex quadratic programming and can be solved in time O (n6L2), where L is the number of input bits. For the upfront-fee policy, we show the optimal policy problem is NPcomplete and we devise an FPTAS algorithm. Moreover, we compare the revenue achievable through the above three pricing policies when all firms are identical. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2022,Computer Science,1

What are the similarities, differences and connections between science and technology linkage, as two different types of knowledge network, deserve to be explored in depth. Drawing on scientific paper co-publications and patent transfer data, we constructed two different types of intercity innovation networks during 2006-2016 in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), a city region special for its 'one country, two systems' structure. After that, we explored the evolutionary characteristics of the networks and further examined the different impacts of multidimensional proximity on scientific collaboration and technology transfer. Our results show that technology transfer is more sensitive to spatial factors, institutional barriers caused by 'one country, two systems' is a bigger obstacle to technology transfer between cities, cultural proximity and cognitive proximity have a more significant impact on paper cooperation network. Moreover, geographical proximity can indirectly affect knowledge spillover by acting on the proximity of other dimensions. As for scientific collaboration, social, cognitive and institutional proximities can compensate for the lack of geographical proximity, and cultural proximity frequently goes along with geographical proximity; as for technology transfer, geographical proximity has neither substitutional or complementarity relations with cultural and cognitive proximities, the interrelatedness between geographical and institutional and social proximities are complementarity which is opposed to paper co-publications. This study explores the differences in spillover mechanisms of different knowledge types and contributes to enriching the empirical framework of multidimensional proximities and innovation network researches.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,1
Improving Contraceptive Service Quality and Accessibility for Adolescents and Youth Through Proprietary Patent Medicine Vendors in Four Nigerian States,; PRIVATE-SECTOR; HEALTH; URBAN; CARE,"Introduction: In Nigeria, health care services and commodities have increasingly been accessed through private sector entities, including retail pharmacies and drug shops (also called proprietary patent medicine vendors [PPMVs]). However, PPMVs cannot provide long -acting or permanent methods, and concerns have been raised about their quality of services and their need to better comply with government regulations. This article describes how The Challenge Initiative ' s (TCI) family planning program supported 4 state governments in Nigeria to develop a model to strengthen public -private partnerships between PPMVs and primary health centers (PHCs) to leverage PPMVs to provide adolescents and youth with high -quality contraceptive information, services, and referrals to PHCs. Program Description: The intervention implemented a hub -spoke model by strengthening the linkages between neighboring PPMVs and large PHCs for delivering contraceptive services to adolescents and youth. The steps in the implementation process included: (1) introducing the intervention to state governments, (2) selecting PPMVs as spokes and high -volume PHCs as hubs, (3) conducting whole -site orientations jointly with PPMV and PHC staff, (4) strengthening referral links between PPMVs and PHCs, (5) implementing supportive supervision and coaching, and (6) strengthening client data management. TCI worked with the state and local ministry of health to improve PPMV operators ' knowledge, attitudes, and skills to deliver adolescent- and youth -friendly services. Lessons Learned and Recommendations: Implementing the PPMV intervention with state governments and PHCs strengthened the public -private partnership. A functional referral system in Plateau State demonstrated significant success, enabling increased contraceptive choice and adherence to regulations for adolescents and youth. We recommend that the government strengthen the working relationship between PPMVs and PHCs, incorporate PPMVs into the routine supportive supervision of the state health system, and incorporate a referral linkage with PHCs into the design and implementation of PPMV programs.",2024,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1

We evaluated the performance of the graft and filler. Methods: SIS was coated with heparin by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. Curdlan acted as the carrier of dipyridamole. Three types of graft tubes (2 mm internal diameter and 20 mm in length) were manufactured: bilayer SIS with 10% curdlan thorn 10% dipyridamole mixture film (SCD), bilayer SIS with 10% curdlan film (SC), and monolayer SIS (S). The remodeling characteristics of the grafts were evaluated by implanting them as bypass in rabbit carotid arteries for 2 and 3 months. Each group contained 16 rabbits, and 16 nonsurgical rabbits served as the control group. Results: Eight rabbits of each group, including the graft occluded group, were killed at 2 months and the others were killed at 3 months. Follow-up showed that all 8 grafts in SCD group were patent at 2 months. Six of 16 grafts in the SC group and 5 of 16 grafts in the S group were occluded at 2 months. One of 8 SCD grafts were occluded at 3 months and the patent showed a confluent endothelium without intimal hyperplasia. The neointima layer was composed of circumferentially aligned vascular smooth muscle cells. At 3 months, SC and S group grafts showed incomplete endothelialization and varying degrees of mural thrombus, accompanied by occlusion in the SC group (3 of 8) and S group (2 of 8). Conclusions: The novel hybrid small caliber artificial vascular graft exhibited an improvement in revascularization resulting in high patency rate.",2020,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery,1
EU framework programmes: positive and negative effects on member states' innovation performance,innovation performance; national innovative capacity; EU investment; DETERMINANTS,"Research background: Seeking to ensure competitiveness in the global market, the EU is constantly improving its innovation policy. Compared to other EU initiatives, the Framework Programs for Research and Innovation (FPs) act as the main instrument with the longest history and the largest budget to boost member states' innovation performance. Despite the initial presumptions that these financial inflows should bring positive and constructive effects, the results significantly diverge across the countries with highly uneven and incoherent progress. Therefore, complex and reliable tools must be adopted to evaluate the long-term influence of EU investment and the reasons which distort the innovation performance in separate member states. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this article is to evaluate the influence of EU investment on its member states' innovation performance by using a redeveloped national innovative capacity framework and including technological, non-technological and commercial innovative output. Methods: Panel unit root tests were used to assess the time series stationarity. Autoregressive distributed lag models helped in calculating the long-term influence of EU investment on member states' innovation performance. Finally, by employing dummies, it was analysed how this influence varied over time and across different countries. Findings & value added: The findings provide evidence that EU investment exerts positive long-term influence on the technological innovative output proxied as total, business and higher education institutions' patent applications, as well as product and process innovations. The effects were also positive on trademarks and marketing, and organisational innovations. However, small but negative influence was found in the case of patent applications by the government sector and the exports of hi-tech products and knowledge-intensive services. These insights may serve in the designing process of the specific instruments and the future innovation policies, which would bring the maximum benefit for the society and economy.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Investigating the Active Substance and Mechanism of San-Jiu-Wei-Tai Granules via UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS and Network Pharmacology,; PEPTIC-ULCER DISEASE; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI; GASTRIC-CANCER; INFLAMMATION; ACTIVATION; COUMARINS; CLASSIFICATION; ANTIBACTERIAL; EXPRESSION; ALBIFLORIN,"San-Jiu-Wei-Tai granules (SJWTG) are a significant Chinese patent medicine for the treatment of chronic gastritis (CG), having outstanding advantages in long-term treatment; however, the chemical composition and potential mechanism have not been investigated until now. In this study, a rapid separation and identification method based on UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS was established, and 95 chemical components from SJWTGs were identified, including 6 chemical components of an unknown source that are not derived from the 8 herbs included in SJWTGs. The identified chemical components were subsequently analysed by network pharmacology, suggesting that the core targets for the treatment of CG with SJWTGs were EGFR, SRC, AKT1, HSP90AA1, MAPK1, and MAPK3 and thus indicating that SJWTGs could reduce the inflammatory response of gastric epithelial cells and prevent persistent chronic inflammation that induces cancerization by regulating the MAPK signalling pathway and the C-type lectin receptor signalling pathway as well as their upstream and downstream pathways in the treatment of CG. The key bioactive components in SJWTGs were identified as 2,6-bis(4-ethylphenyl)perhydro-1,3,5,7-tetraoxanaphth-4-ylethane-1,2-diol, a chemical component of an unknown source, murrangatin, meranzin hydrate, paeoniflorin, and albiflorin. The results of molecular docking showed the strong binding interaction between the key bioactive components and the core targets, demonstrating that the key bioactive components deserve to be further studied and considered as Q-markers. By acting on multiple targets, SJWTG is less susceptible to drug resistance during the long-term treatment of CG, indicating the advantage of Chinese patent medicines. Furthermore, the preventive effect of SJWTGs on gastric cancer also demonstrates the superiority of preventive treatment of disease with traditional Chinese medicine.",2022,Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1

How IPO firms' product innovation strategy affects the likelihood of post-IPO acquisitions?,Product innovation; Trademarks; IPO; M&A; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TAKEOVER DEFENSES; MERGERS; MARKET; GAINS; COMPETITION; OWNERSHIP; PATENTS; SEARCH; LAW,"This study investigates why newly listed firms become M&A targets shortly after their initial public offering (IPOs) from the perspective of product innovation. We find strong empirical evidence that IPOs with less established trademarks increase the likelihood of becoming IPO targets. We also find that the negative relation between established trademarks and the likelihood of becoming IPO targets is more pronounced in highly competitive industries and is primarily driven by the M&A supply side. IPOs with more established trademarks can fend themselves against the product market race as independent firms. They can meanwhile realize superior post-IPO financial as well as innovation performance. To acquire such firms, acquirers need to offer substantially higher takeover premiums. However, some empirical evidence suggests that less product innovation-intensive IPOs tend to deliberately seek potential acquirers to support their product market competing position and therefore are more likely to initiate an M&A deal shortly after going public.",2022,Business & Economics,1
An Empirical Analysis on the Impact of Innovation Network Structure on Crossover Innovation Performance of Emerging Technologies,; UNCERTAINTY,"The crossover innovation springing up in emerging technologies has drawn wide attention from scholars. Innovation network, as an effective way for major innovation-driven entities towards less relevant risks and higher efficiency, can significantly affect the crossover innovation performance. This paper analyzes the evolution law of the innovation network of autonomous driving technology based on the Social Network Analysis (SNA) and by using the data on joint applications for invention patents of such technology during 2006-2020. Furthermore, the structural eigenvalues of the network evolution are calculated for the regression analysis of the relationship between network structure and crossover innovation performance. The empirical results show that network centrality, structural hole, and relationship intensity have a positive effect on crossover innovation performance of emerging technologies, while network clustering has a negative effect. Emerging technology enterprises should constantly improve their technological innovation ability, improve their status and influence in the innovation network, establish cooperation with appropriate innovation partners, further expand their own technical knowledge fields, and obtain innovation resources by optimizing the network structure so as to enhance the crossover innovation performance.",2022,Mathematical & Computational Biology; Neurosciences & Neurology,1
Intellectual property and the organization of the global value chain,; VERTICAL INTEGRATION; PATENT PROTECTION; RIGHTS; DETERMINANTS; CONTRACTS,"This paper highlights the role of intangible assets in a property rights model of firm organization with sequential production. Empirical evidence based on foreign direct investment and transaction-level trade data of Slovenian firms reveals that the strength of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the supplier's location affects firms' organizational choices whenever supplier investments are sequential complements. In this case, when a firm must transmit know-how to each supplier, and more knowledge is accrued as production moves downstream, better IPR institutions lead to lower incidence of vertical integration over outsourcing, principally at more downstream stages. On the other hand, the organizational choice is far less responsive to IPR protection for sequential substitutes. Moreover, we show that improving IPR and contracting institutions (e.g. rule of law) may have the opposite effect on firm boundaries.

In addition to several challenges common to high-priced prescription drugs, insulin faces several unique legal, regulatory, and practical challenges to increasing access and affordability. Despite the fact that insulin was developed almost 100 years ago, the insulin market is dominated by only three companies and there continue to be no biosimilar competitors in the United States. Unlike many high-priced prescription drugs, insulin has been insulated from competition for years. This article examines the barriers to competition in the insulin market, considering the challenges surrounding regulatory approval, interchangeability, trade secrets, and anticompetitive behavior. Further, this article discusses the potential and limitations of various legislative proposals to address access to insulin. In doing so, this article attempts to explain why there is such limited competition in the insulin market and identifies issues specific to the insulin market for lawmakers to consider in developing proposals to address access to affordable insulin in the United States.",2021,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,1
From a distinctive sign to an exchangeable asset: exploring the US market for trademark licensing,Market for trademark; trademark licencing; trademark classes; licensors; licensees; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PROPENSITY SCORE; INDICATOR; BRAND; INNOVATION; SERVICES; PATENTS; LAW,"A remarkable growth in the value of trademark licencing has been recently recorded. Our paper contributes to the understanding of this under-explored phenomenon using a dataset newly released by the USPTO. Our study analyses the evolution of licencing activities in the U.S. during the 2003?2017 period, the characteristics of these trademarks and agreements, and certain features of the licencing parties involved. We found that licencing activities varied considerably during these years. They were usually signed between two parties only, and, on average, they involved more than one trademark. Excluding under-reporting effect, the analyses reveal that a large portion of heterogeneity in licencing activity is due to the NICE international classes associated with each trademark. Indeed, trademark licencing agreements appear to be unevenly distributed across these classes, suggesting that this activity and the way it is carried out is correlated with the market to which the licenced trademark refers.",2020,Business & Economics,1
Systemic pharmacological investigation of the Feng Shi Gu Tong capsule in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,Feng Shi Gu Tong capsule; Rheumatoid arthritis; Systemic pharmacology; Targets; TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; CELL LUNG-CANCER; NETWORK PHARMACOLOGY; GROWTH-FACTOR; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME; IN-VITRO; PATHWAY; TARGET; IDENTIFICATION,"Feng Shi Gu Tong (FSGT) capsule is a commonly used Chinese Traditional Patent Medicine in clinical practice, which has been proven to be effective for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, due to its complex composition, the precise molecular mechanism of the FSGT capsule in the treatment of RA is still indistinct. Therefore, the method of systemic pharmacology was used to obtain candidate compounds through absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination (ADME) parameters, and supplementation of references. Network construction and analysis were also included to reveal the potential mechanism of FSGT capsule in treating RA. A total of 119 compounds were obtained in FSGT capsule, and a total of 107 compounds with targets were included in the study. These compounds acted on 267 targets in total. In addition, there were 317 targets related to RA disease. All constructed networks included four major networks and four minor networks. In addition, the clusters of RA disease protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and FSGT capsule-RA disease targets network revealed that the biological process involved in these clusters including immune response and apoptosis, etc. The pathways enriched by the direct targets of FSGT capsule acted on RA also highly overlapped with the pathways enriched by the RA PPI network, such as the TNF signaling pathway. Our research has managed to predict and explain the pharmacological effects and the molecular mechanisms of the FSGT capsule in RA, and provided a realistic exploration method for studying the potentially active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines simultaneously.",2021,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
"Section 2 Mangled: FTC v Qualcomm on the Duty to Deal, Price Squeezes, and Exclusive Dealing",; CONDUCT,"Judge Koh handed down a sweeping opinion in May 2019 condemning as antitrust violations many of Qualcomm's licensing practices related to its patented chips and standard-essential technology used in mobile devices. The district court opinion significantly expands the scope of liability for refusals to deal and for non-predatory pricing, further eroding the longstanding symmetrical approach to antitrust enforcement regardless of the kind of property involved. We find three glaring errors in the district court opinion. First, the court expands the exception to the general rule permitting refusals to deal, as laid out in Aspen Skiing, well beyond the outer boundary of Section 2 by inappropriately inferring a prior course of dealing and erroneously finding a willingness to sacrifice profits. Secondly, the district court accepted a price squeeze theory-characterized by the FTC as a 'tax' on OEMs transacting with Qualcomm's rivals-directly contrary to the Supreme Court's holding in linkLine. Thirdly, the court erroneously concluded that Qualcomm's exclusive dealing arrangements with Apple violate the Sherman Act, despite a glaring failure by the FTC to prove substantial foreclosure, contrary to modern antitrust precedent and economic theory. The district court's inappropriate extension of antitrust liability in three separate areas of well-settled antitrust doctrine is remarkable and threatens to upend important precedent that has successfully guided business conduct for many years. Further, the remedy transforms the role of antitrust courts from adjudicators to central planners, a role for which the Trinko Court expressly stated they are ill suited. The decision invites plaintiffs to use the Sherman Act to reach conduct that has been generally shielded from antitrust liability. That invitation is ill advised and should be rejected by the Ninth Circuit, and if necessary, the Supreme Court.",2020,Government & Law,1

The rate law is derived from data collected using a constant volume batch reactor, and a model for a storage room with an associated isothermal packed bed reactor is developed. The amount of catalyst required to maintain an ethylene concentration of 0.1 ppmv in a room containing 20 tons of fruit having an ethylene metabolism of 0.1 mu l/kg h was calculated as a function of air temperature and water content. While the catalyst can continuously remove ethylene from saturated, refrigerated air, the amount of catalyst required can be reduced significantly by incorporating conventional air conditioning solutions upstream of the catalyst bed. Such combined systems and their functions are discussed.",2022,Engineering,1
Impact of Regulatory Policy Changes on Generic Drug Prices in the United States,Congressional Budget Office (CBO); Federal Trade Commission (FTC); Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA); USFDA; Drug Prices; MEDICARE,"Introduction: Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) was introduced in 2012 to bring more and more generic drugs into the market in a short time through an effective review process. In the present study, the impact of the GDUFA on prices of the generic drugs has been evaluated.Materials and Methods: Various research reports related to drug costs and competition such as (i) reasons for high drug prices, (ii) FDA's research on drug prices pre-and post-GDUFA, and (iii) the current status of generic drugs in the USA produced by different agencies including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to understand the challenges of high drug costs have been critically evaluated.Results and Discussion:The analysis of research reports generated over some time concludes that the fall in generic drug prices has been accelerated further in recent years, with increased competition. The data analysis also reflects that during the GDUFA period, the Agency has been able to proactively address the challenges posed by brand-product companies. However, some issues remain to be addressed.Conclusion: The scope of this evaluation was limited to focus on FDA-related aspects where generic competition can be enhanced by making the generic drug approval process more efficient, continue to facilitate industry on complex products regulation to bring generic equivalents of complex products where patents expired long-time back, help resolve shortages faster and help expedite resolution of site compliance matters more quickly to assist in resuming supplies.",2023,Education & Educational Research; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

Based on this algorithm, a Working Group (WG), including ESCEO members and Chinese experts, wished to see how the new ESCEO algorithm was perceived by Chinese experts in knee OA and how it was integrated into their clinical practice. Methods A WG was held between members of the international ESCEO task force and a group of Chinese experts. Results Non-pharmacological approach should be combined with pharmacological interventions. In step 1, symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) are the most important background drugs. Evidence, supported by high-quality research, is available only for crystalline glucosamine sulfate (pCGS) and chondroitin sulfate. Topical NSAIDs could be used as an additional option. In step 2, oral NSAIDs could be useful, but cardiovascular/renal/gastrointestinal profiles of the patients should be considered. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid and corticosteroids are alternative to oral NSAIDs, but the evidence is still limited. If steps 1 and 2 are not sufficient, weak opioids could be used. Overall, the conclusions of the ESCEO algorithm are accepted in China for products available in this country. The WG suggests the importance of economic studies, specifically made in China. Conclusion This work provides evidence-based advice to establish a treatment algorithm in knee OA, for practical implementation in clinical practice in China.",2021,Geriatrics & Gerontology,1

Methods The association of SNHG6 or miR-101-3p with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in patents with NSCLC was assessed by TCGA dataset. Cell proliferation and invasion were evaluated by MTT and Transwell assays and SNHG6-specific binding with miR-101-3p was verified by bioinformatic analysis, luciferase gene report and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. qRT-PCR and Western blot was used to assess the effects of SNHG6 on the expression of miR-101-3p and chromodomain Y like (CDYL) in NSCLC cells. A xenograft tumor model in vivo was established to observe the effects of SNHG6 knockdown on tumor growth. Results We found that increased expression of SNHG6 was associated with pathological stage and lymph node infiltration, and acted as an independent prognostic factor of tumor recurrence in patients with NSCLC. Silencing SNHG6 expression repressed cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo, but overexpression of SNHG6 reversed these effects. Furthermore, SNHG6 was identified to act as a sponge of miR-101-3p, which could reduce cell proliferation and attenuate SNHG6-induced CDYL expression. Low expression of miR-101-3p or high expression of CDYL was related to poor survival in patients with NSCLC. Conclusions Our findings demonstrated that lncRNA SNHG6 contributed to the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC by downregulating miR-101-3p.",2020,Oncology; Respiratory System,1
Modulation Harms and the Google Home,; SMART HOME; ALIENATION,"Deleuze's (1992) modulation is frequently invoked to explain power relations in hyper-connected, sensorised environments. However, attempts to articulate the harmful implications of modulation-a critical step in the process of considering the need for legal intervention-have been modest. In this paper, we theorise four harms arising from the exercise of modulatory power: subsumption, amplification, vibration, and alienation. To do so, we outline the core features of Deleuzean modulatory power (Deleuze 1992), illustrated through contrasts with Foucauldian discipline (Foucault 1995, 1988). Then, drawing on Julie Cohen's (2013, 2015, 2018, 2019) modulation as a two-way flow of predicted and prescripted modes of governance and knowledge production, we explore and situate our harms in the sensorised and smart home, employing Google's patented vision as a concrete example (Fadell et al. 2020). We contend that modulation harms arise from the continuous flow and constant agitation of insistent modification (D'Amato 2019) enabled by sensorisation. The core power act that gives rise to modulation harm is the ability to harness, direct, and provide frequency to flows of sensor data to achieve continual behavioural modification and shape social norms about the purposes and benefits of such modification. The overarching harm we identify is subsumption, the infrastructural enclosure of all sensorised environments that enables social shaping to take place anywhere, which gives rise to the other modulation harms. Amplification harms regard auto-regulatory norms as an unquestioned facet of an automated human life. Vibration harms arise from the automated ability to prescribe changes in affect. Alienation harms regard subtle denials of access to informational networks. We show that the Google sensorised home both modulates and disciplines occupants concurrently, but more importantly, these concurrent power acts can take place wherever an individual is tethered to the modulation infrastructure and sensor data can be harnessed.",2021,Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Suitability of two WHO research and development initiatives for COVID-19 to promote equitable innovation: the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator and COVID-19 Technology Access Pool,Access to health technologies; equity; global health; COVID-19; World Health Organization; ,"Objectives. To analyze the World Health Organization's (WHO's) contribution to promotion of access to innova-tive technologies by assessing its initiatives on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) research, development, and innovation.Methods. A document search was done for previous criteria used by WHO working groups to evaluate inno-vation and access merits. Two sets of criteria were identified. One set was used to assess the suitability of existing mechanisms to coordinate research, development, and innovation and pool funds globally. The second set was used to measure success in implementing demonstration projects and consider the extent of innovative components being implemented by them. These criteria were applied to the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) and Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) initiatives. Scores were classified as: meets the criteria (2); partially meets the criteria (1); does not meet the criteria (0).Results. Both initiatives met all the first set of criteria. C-TAP, an initiative based on a patent pool and other open knowledge approaches, best met the second set of criteria, scoring 7 out of 12 points. ACT-A, based on pooled funds, advanced purchase agreements, and voluntary contributions, met none of the second set of criteria.Conclusions. Equitable access to health technologies has been a recurring problem in recent pandemics and initiatives were proposed to prevent it. However, even though COVID-19 has been the greatest health crisis in the 21st century, market dynamics still prevailed. Income disparities between countries and lack of support for solidarity and a global health approach only aggravated the negative health and economic impacts.",2022,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
Cannabis Derivatives and Trademark Registration: The Case of Delta-8-THC,; LEGAL STRATEGY; CONFUSION; MARIJUANA,"The legal environment surrounding the cannabis industry is ambiguous and constantly changing. While cannabis is prohibited under federal law, a 2018 statute legalized a variant of the cannabis plant (hemp) that is low in its most common intoxicating agents. Recognizing this, entrepreneurs began to process hemp to extract and sell chemicals contained therein. Included in this trend is the extraction of Delta-8 Tetrahydrocannabinol (.48-THC)-a psychoactive drug with an increasing market presence in states where most cannabis (e.g., marijuana) is illegal. As competition in the .48-THC field emerged, firms sought to distinguish their wares through brand recognition and federal trademark registration. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office refuses to register these marks-arguing that .48-THC does not satisfy the requirement that products be used in legal commerce. On this point, the USPTO interprets relevant law as criminalizing the sale of Delta 8-THC. That conclusion stands in contrast to determinations reached by the Drug Enforcement Agency and federal courts. This Article addresses the propriety of federal registration of Delta 8-THC trademarks. It critically analyzes the intersection of federal drug law, hemp's legalization, and administrative regulations to answer the question. Based on this research, a strong case for the registration of Delta 8-THC marks1 arises. This conclusion has public and private importance. To seek registration of a Delta 8-THC mark, applicants must aver that they use it in commerce. This could amount to admitting to the sale of an illegal drug-depending on the interpretation of somewhat ambiguous regulations. With this in mind, a law and strategy analysis is employed to explain why firms take that risk to seek trademark registration. On this issue, the Article identifies specific current market advantages and future strategic gains that warrant this exposure. Further, public benefits of Delta 8-THC registration are explored. A current concern in this largely unregulated market is the presence of harmful impurities in goods sold for human consumption. This issue can be mitigated by aligning the public interest in safe products with private financial incentives. Specifically, the ability to maintain strong trademark rights encourages the creation of goodwill through the sale of quality products. Recognizing this, firms are encouraged to reduce impurities in their Delta 8-THC wares under the belief that this will benefit their reputation and thus increase sales.",2022,Government & Law,1

Indicators of four core concepts (R&D, IP protection, collaboration, and external financing) of the innovation process were built using keywords frequency analysis. These web-based indicators were validated using several indicators built from a classic questionnaire-based survey with the following methods: correlation analysis, multitraits multimethods (MTMM) matrices, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results suggest that formative indices built with the questionnaire and web-based indicators measure the same concept, which is not the case when considering the items from the questionnaire separately. Web-based indicators can act either as complements to direct measures or as substitutes for broader measures, notably the importance of R&D and the importance of IP protection, which are normally measured using conventional methods, such as government administrative data or questionnaire-based surveys.",2020,Information Science & Library Science,1

Methanolic crude extract of R. tetraphylla L.leaf exhibited maximum antibacterial potential against six fouling organisms isolated from Parangipettai coast and was further taken up for column fractionation. Twenty-four fractions were obtained, among which five fractions showed inhibitory efficiency against microfoulers of Bacillus megaterium. The active compounds present in the bioactive fraction were identified by FTIR, GC-MS and NMR (13C; 1H). The bioactive compounds that exhibited maximum antifouling activity were identified as Lycopersene (80%), Hexadecanoic acid; 1, 2-Benzenedicarbox-ylic acid, dioctyl ester; Heptadecene -(8) -carbonic acid -(1) and Oleic acid. Molecular docking studies of the potent anti-fouling compounds Lycopersene, Hexadecanoic acid, 1, 2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, dioctyl ester and Oleic acid showed the binding energy of 6.6, -3.8,-5.3 and-5.9 (Kcal/mol) and hence these compounds will act as a potential biocide to control the aquatic foulers.

Utilizing a balanced panel dataset spanning 15 years from 2003 to 2017 and covering 286 European regions, we conducted a study that integrated collaborative patent data and foreign investments with emerging countries. Our findings indicate that technological collaboration primarily depends on inward FDIs (from emerging countries to Europe) rather than outward FDIs (from Europe to emerging countries). Furthermore, we discovered that a mutually reinforcing process can significantly enhance this collaboration. In this context, such a process acts as a cornerstone for the European Union (EU), offering a potential solution to navigate the paradoxical pressure between the rise of protectionism in response to the imbalances and inequalities stemming from globalization and the need to promote an environment conducive to global openness, competition and innovation.",2024,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,1

We combined insights from literature review and 15 exploratory interviews of multiple stakeholders, and developed a framework to examine university-industry linkages. We grounded our framework on the social exchange theory (SET) and quadruple helix concept. It proposes university climate readiness (e.g. incentive system), firm climate readiness (e.g. managers' attitude toward academic research), and exchange readiness (e.g. a firm's absorptive capacity) as antecedents to science-business collaboration, coupled with environmental readiness factors (e.g. unique socio-cultural setting in developing economies) as moderating variables. The framework highlights (1) functional value (i.e. technology pricing, quality, and applicability) and (2) relational value (i.e. trust between academia and industry) in the said relationship. The framework further provides a basis for practitioners to arrive at a suitable university-developed technology transfer mode (e.g. patent licensing, research services, and research partnerships).",2022,Business & Economics,1
A New Method of Regulation of Loads Acting on the Shaft Lining in Sections Located in the Salt Rock Mass,mine shaft; salt rock; leaching; ,"Rock salt is characterized by specific geomechanical and rheological properties. Layers of rock salt at depths of over 900 m cause problems with shaft lining deformation. Methods of shaft lining protection used to date (e.g., in the Sieroszowice mine) have not been effective enough. The research presents a patented and copyright protected concept of a shaft lining construction that can be used in rock masses with strong rheological properties and susceptibility to leaching. A high value of convergence in salt rock mass is a reason for serious problems with shaft lining stability. Numerous trials have been done to provide appropriate shaft lining for salt layers, especially to ensure proper geometry of shaft members and conveyance guidance. In the new shaft lining concept, the excessive rock creep into the outbreak inside the shaft diameter is removed by local and controlled leaching of the shaft cheeks by means of fresh water through a porous medium at the contact layer behind the watertight tubing lining.

Successful Treatment in a Child with Refractory Periungual Warts by Local Hyperthermia: A Case Report,child; local hyperthermia; periungual warts; refractory warts; CONDYLOMA ACUMINATA; KERATINOCYTES,"Periungual wart is a kind of verruca vulgaris that occurs alongside or underlying the nails, which is challenging to treat and prone to recurrence, seriously affecting the quality of patients' life. We report a 6-year-old boy with periungual warts who had experienced various treatments with no improvement and even worsening. Therefore, we tried to treat the patient with local hyperthermia which uses a patented device that has an infrared emission source. The heat generated by infrared rays acts on the local skin surface. The mechanism of this therapy may be to establish a specific immune response against human papillomavirus-infected tissues, thereby facilitating the clearance of human papillomavirus at irradiated and non-irradiated sites. Local hyperthermia has the advantages of non-contact, safety, noninvasive, less pain, and so on. After 5 treatments, the irradiated periungual warts completely cleared after 2 weeks. The unirradiated sites were almost cured after 7 weeks. This case suggests that local thermotherapy has shown great advantages in the treatment of these refractory periungual warts and offers a new and effective therapy in patients with periungual warts.",2022,Dermatology,1

It is essential to summarize the successful experience and promote the development of new drugs. This study aimed to explore the common mechanism of action of the four Chinese patent medicine (CPMs) recommended in the Medical Observation Period COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Protocol and to accelerate the new drug development process. Firstly, the active ingredients and targets of the four CPMs were obtained by the Chinese medicine composition database (TCMSP, TCMID) and related literature, and the common action targets of the four TCMs were sorted out. Secondly, the targets of COVID-19 were obtained through the gene-disease database (GeneCards, NCBI). Then the Venn diagram was used to intersect the common drug targets with the disease targets. And GO and KEGG pathway functional enrichment analysis was performed on the intersected targets with the help of the R package. Finally, the results were further validated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis. As a result, a total of 101 common active ingredients and 21 key active ingredients of four CPMs were obtained, including quercetin, luteolin, acacetin, kaempferol, baicalein, naringenin, artemisinin, aloe-emodin, which might be medicinal substances for the treatment of COVID-19. TNF, IL6, IL1B, CXCL8, CCL2, IL2, IL4, ICAM1, IFNG, and IL10 has been predicted as key targets. 397 GO biological functions and 166 KEGG signaling pathways were obtained. The former was mainly enriched in regulating apoptosis, inflammatory response, and T cell activation. The latter, with 92 entries related to COVID-19, was mainly enriched to signaling pathways such as Coronavirus disease-COVID-19, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, IL-17 signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Molecular docking results showed that 19/21 of key active ingredients exhibited strong binding activity to recognized COVID-19-related targets (3CL of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and S protein), even better than one of these four antiviral drugs. Among them, shinflavanone had better affinity to 3CL, ACE2, and S protein of SARS-CoV-2 than these four antiviral drugs. In summary, the four CPMs may play a role in the treatment of COVID-19 by binding flavonoids such as quercetin, luteolin, and acacetin to target proteins such as ACE2, 3CLpro, and S protein and acting on TNF, IL6, IL1B, CXCL8, and other targets to participate in broad-spectrum antiviral, immunomodulatory and inflammatory responses.",2022,General & Internal Medicine,1
Antitrust and Authorized Generics: A New Predation Analysis,; PRICE-COMPETITION; DRUGS; PRESCRIPTION; CONSUMERS; ENTRY; COST; ACT,"Much attention in the antitrust world has been focused on efforts by brand drug manufacturers to delay or deter generic entry into the pharmaceutical markets following these brand drugs' loss of patent exclusivity. Scholars have recounted and criticized recent exclusionary techniques by brand drug manufacturers, including pay-fordelay (or reverse-payment settlement) agreements, noncash pay-for-delay agreements, and product hopping. These efforts, while successful in stymieing generic entry into the prescription drug market, have largely been struck down by courts as anticompetitive in a series of recent decisions. In light of these decisions, a key, but underanalyzed, concern now is that in order to keep generics out of the market, or at least delay their entry, brand manufacturers will turn to a new tactic: predatory pricing using authorized generics. While some scholarly attention was paid to authorized generics in the early 2000s, almost none has been given since the Supreme Court held unlawful brand drug manufacturers' other main exclusionary tactics, despite the fact that the time is now ripe for the launch of authorized generics. Given that courts have already permitted a brand manufacturer's launch of an authorized generic during a first-filer generic's exclusivity period, brand manufacturers could deter generic entry by launching an authorized generic upon the start of the first filer's exclusivity period but pricing the authorized generic below the generic's costs, thereby preventing the generic from recouping its substantial entry costs. Eventually, if generics see a pattern of brands launching authorized generics during the first filer's period of exclusivity, generics may be deterred from entering the market at all before patent expiration, thereby depriving consumers of price competition in the pharmaceutical market, resulting in higher drug prices overall. The problem, however, is that if brand manufacturers are in fact pricing their authorized generics below the generic manufacturers' costs in order to deter generic entry, it is unduly difficult to hold the brand manufacturers accountable under the Supreme Court's current predatory pricing doctrine. Its test, as enunciated in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., only imposes liability if a predator prices below some measure of its own costs and if there is a reasonable probability that the predator will recoup its initial investment in low prices. This Note provides a new analysis that better accounts for the unique regulatory structure and patent protection of the prescription drug market. It argues that a test based on limit pricing, or pricing below the entrant's costs, would more effectively address this exclusionary conduct that harms consumers.",2020,Government & Law,1
WHY JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE FAILS,; ARTICLE-III; SUPREME-COURT; FEDERALIST SOCIETY; POLITICAL-PARTIES; UNITED-STATES; LEGAL REALISM; JURISDICTION; LAW; ADJUDICATION; SEPARATION,"Judicial independence seems under siege. President Trump condemns federal courts for their political bias; his erstwhile presidential opponents mull various court-packing plans; and courts, in turn, are lambasted for abandoning a long-held constitutional convention against institutional manipulation. At the same time, across varied lines of jurisprudence, the Roberts Court evinces a deep worry about judicial independence. This preoccupation with threats to judicial independence infuses recent opinions on administrative deference, bankruptcy, patent adjudication, and jurisdiction-stripping. Yet the Court has not offered a single, overarching definition of what it means by the term judicial independence. Nor has it explained how its disjointed doctrinal interventions add up to a coherent theory of institutional autonomy. And it remains unclear how debates on judicial independence among jurists relate to debates about the same term in the larger public sphere. This Article's first contribution is to analyze how the Roberts Court understands the term judicial independence and how its doctrinal rules fall far short of realizing even the aspirations the Court has for that term. This case study in doctrinal specification illuminates the gap between the Justices' own ethical aspiration toward judicial independence and its institutional realization-a gap that generates confusion, uncertainty, and opportunities for circumvention. This Article then abstracts away from the particulars of the Roberts Court's jurisprudence to explore the origins of this aspiration-implementation gap. To motivate this more general analysis, it first demonstrates that there is a large range of constitutional-design options for a founder seeking to create independent courts. The Framers of Article III embraced certain of these options and rejected others. Specifically, they preferred ex post to ex ante checks on political interference in the judiciary. Subsequent experience, though, has demonstrated that their choice of judicial independence's institutional forms rested on flawed presuppositions. In particular, the Framers failed to anticipate the rise of partisanship as a motivating principle for national political action, and also the unexpectedly strong incentives that push legislatures toward vague or ambiguous statutory texts, leaving ample discretion for judges' policy preferences. Today, it is possible to identify a range of instruments through which elected actors can achieve such unraveling. The three most important can be labeled cracking, packing, and stacking by analogy to techniques of partisan gerrymandering. This taxonomical exercise illuminates how, in practice, the jurisprudence and politics of judicial independence fall so far short of professed ethical aspirations. This exercise further points toward the possibility of a more institutionally grounded account of what plausibly can be expected in terms of federal court autonomy from the partisan currents of American political life.",2021,Government & Law,1
On the universality of medical device regulations: the case of Benin,Medical device regulations; Hermeneutic heuristic framework; Low-resource settings; Legal transplantation; Frugal regulation; Bioethics by design; LEGAL; HEALTH; TECHNOLOGY; ETHICS; LAW,"Background Regulatory frameworks surrounding medical devices (MDs) and medical locations are of utter importance for safeguarding patients and users, and for granting a universal access to healthcare. Currently, as the main existing regulatory frameworks are drafted by high-income countries, they pretend to be general and applicable globally, but fail to understand particular contexts, specifically those in low-resource settings (LRSs), resulting, therefore, inapplicable. In particular, LRSs present a varied situation, with legal transplants of guidelines from their previous colonial regimes. This apparently theoretical issue, is, effectively, a tangible and rising matter of concern, given the ever-increasing number of MD patent applications per year, as well as the appearance of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) on the MD market itself. This article will focus on the European Regulation on MDs 745/2017 and its applicability in LRSs, specifically presenting the case of Benin, a Sub-Saharan African country. Methods This work is based on a field study conducted in 2019 in Benin, which is particularly exemplar to show the complexity of the legal transplantation concept. A multidisciplinary approach, comprising the standard tools and methods of ethics, law, and biomedical engineering, was used to draft a heuristic hermeneutic framework, and to analyse related bioethical issues concerning Medical Device Regulations (MDRs) in LRSs, the role of Maintenance, and other sociological questions; as well as the rural population's perception on MDs and health technologies, and the role of ethics in the hospitals of LRSs. Results The definition of these themes helped approach the local perspective and define the research questions. Downstream of the analysis of the Medical Devices Regulations, the Maintenance and other bioethical issues in Benin, the heuristic hermeneutic framework was created to guide a shift in the paradigm of law and regulation making, so as to make them more contextualised and inclusive, globally. Conclusion This article proposes a framework that will help policymakers take into account the particularism of each context, especially those of the most vulnerable countries, when drafting and issuing regulatory frameworks, promoting an ever-evolving model of universalism.",2022,Health Care Sciences & Services,1
Flexural Creep Behavior of High-Density Polyethylene Lumber and Wood Plastic Composite Lumber Made from Thermally Modified Wood,viscoelasticity; WPC; HDPE; composite; wood; creep; thermoplastic; flexure; power law; modeling; TIME,"The use of wood plastic composite lumber as a structural member material in marine applications is challenging due to the tendency of wood plastic composites (WPCs) to creep and absorb water. A novel patent-pending WPC formulation that combines a thermally modified wood flour (as a cellulosic material) and a high strength styrenic copolymer (high impact polystyrene and styrene maleic anhydride) have been developed with advantageous viscoelastic properties (low initial creep compliance and creep rate) compared with the conventional WPCs. In this study, the creep behavior of the WPC and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) lumber in flexure was characterized and compared. Three sample groupings of WPC and HDPE lumber were subjected to three levels of creep stress; 7.5, 15, and 30% of the ultimate flexural strength (Fb) for a duration of 180 days. Because of the relatively low initial creep compliance of the WPC specimens (five times less) compared with the initial creep compliance of HDPE specimens, the creep deformation of HDPE specimens was six times higher than the creep deformation of WPC specimens at the 30% creep stress level. A Power Law model predicted that the strain (3%) to failure in the HDPE lumber would occur in 1.5 years at 30% Fb flexural stress while the predicted strain (1%) failure for the WPC lumber would occur in 150 years. The findings of this study suggest using the WPC lumber in structural application to replace the HDPE lumber in flexure attributable to the low time-dependent deformation when the applied stress value is withing the linear region of the stress-strain relationship.",2020,Polymer Science,1
"Scarcity, Property Rights, Irresponsibility: How Intellectual Property Deals with Neglected Tropical Diseases",Scarcity; Irresponsibility; Intellectual property; Neglected tropical diseases; Public domain; LONGER; PRICE; LAW,"The article addresses the role of scarcity in negotiating the relationship between intellectual property, particularly from a legal-economic perspective, and property rights, as understood by transaction cost economics, to shed light on the deadlock faced by those suffering from neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The consistency of the law and economics fundamentals that support the trade on knowledge goods, namely patents on essential medicines, is put under check by Scott Veitch's scholarship on legal irresponsibility. The damages that emerge from the operations of the intellectual property system are registered in the novel concept of negative public domain, and are due mainly to the lack of access to treatments that end up being unaffordable, or to innovation that leads to new drugs that is not sufficiently incentivised though price signals. The accountability for such damages is taken into consideration by arguing that the disavowal of responsibility is made possible by the negative public domain, which is balanced by the construction of a positive response through the language of rights. As such, responsibility per se is preserved, evading one instantiation of Teubner's legal paradoxes, but rendered ineffective by design. In other words, even if the harms endured by those affected by the NTDs can be traced back to the operations of the intellectual property system, there is no one to hold accountable. The main goal pursued through the article is to make such an arrangement explicit, by giving centrality to the notion of scarcity and its interplay between legal and economic theory, alongside the novel concept of negative public domain as a site where the actual consequences of irresponsibility lie, to hopefully inform further critique in subsequent works.",2023,Government & Law,1

The occurrence of innovation activities is a complex systemic behavior. Its spatial distribution has some location selection laws, which are the result of interaction and feedback between various spatial influence factors. We explain the impact mechanism from the microscale using a street unit in a city. Hangzhou was selected as a case study. First, we systematically selected factors influencing the spatial distribution of innovation activities as the independent variable based on the demands of innovation subjects. Patents were used as the dependent variable to represent the spatial distribution of innovation activities. Second, ensemble algorithms (Boosting) were used to analyze the influence contribution of independent variables to dependent variables. Then, based on the aspects of innovation driving force, which are innovation resources and innovation environments, relevant factors were divided into the following seven categories: innovation industry concentration, knowledge intensity, innovative talent resources, service facilities, external transportation convenience, public transportation convenience, and ecological environment. We interpreted the impact mechanism and made corresponding suggestions for urban innovation space planning.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Alternative system to measure hydrogen content in molten aluminium using an electrochemical sensor,Degassing; Aluminium alloys; Hydrogen content; Electrochemical gas sensor; Physical pores; Solidification; ,"The most reliable techniques for the direct measurement of hydrogen content in liquid aluminium are based on Sievert's law or use electrochemical probes introduced directly in liquid aluminium. The main drawback of these methods is the high cost of the equipment. An alternative apparatus has been developed and tested. This equipment combines a widely used and much cheaper hydrogen electrochemical sensor with the procedure already patented and commonly used by gas recirculation techniques. The device has been constructed and calibrated using gaseous mixtures of known hydrogen content. For validation, the results obtained with this apparatus have been compared with hydrogen content measurements in liquid aluminium using the commercial Alscan equipment in an industrial facility. Experimental results suggest that the apparatus proposed in this work is capable of detecting hydrogen content in liquid aluminium obtaining measurements that are in a good agreement with those obtained using the commercial Alscan equipment. On the other hand, results also suggest that it is important to take into account the operating atmospheric pressure to correct the readings obtained from Alscan when operating at atmospheric pressure levels far from 1 atm.",2020,Engineering; Materials Science,1
Old wine in a new bottle? Assessing the injunction remedy for intellectual property disputes in China,intellectual property; preliminary injunctions; permanent injunctions; China; US; equitable approach; PATENT HOLDUP,"The landmark eBay case in the US has noticeably influenced Chinese judicial practices concerning intellectual property injunctions. The injunctive relief in intellectual property infringement cases in China has witnessed a change from a traditional automatic-granting approach to a more equitable approach. However, there are still some issues, namely: the standards of awarding injunctive relief in intellectual property cases are unclear; the civil law tradition and procedure can create issues when applying for injunctions; and the scope of the injunction could be disproportionate in certain cases. In order to address these concerns, China needs to publish judicial interpretations to clarify that the eBay test can be applied to both preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions. China should further polish up its civil procedure legislation to enable a permanent injunction to be effective immediately, even at the first instance, and to allow the parties to an intellectual property contract to have agreements on conditions of applying for injunctive relief. Additionally, Chinese courts should adopt a proportionate method in determining cases regarding intellectual property injunctions.",2021,Government & Law,1
Race as a Ghost Variable in (White) Opioid Research,opioids; race; pharmaceutical science; neuroscience; addiction; BRAIN DISEASE; ADDICTION; DRUG; BUPRENORPHINE; NEUROBIOLOGY; NEUROSCIENCE; METHADONE; POLITICS; MODEL,"This paper traces the unspoken, implicit white racial logic of the brain disease model of addiction, which is based on seemingly universal, disembodied brains devoid of social or environmental influences. In the United States, this implicit white logic led to context-free neuroscience that made the social hierarchies of addiction and its consequences invisible to, and thus exacerbated by, national policies on opioids. The brain disease model of addiction was selectively deployed among the white middle-class population that had long accessed narcotics and pharmaceutical treatments for narcotics disorders from biomedical clinics, as opposed to from illegal sources subject to law enforcement. In turn, new treatments for opioid addiction were racially marketed to the same white clientele to which newly patented opioid analgesics were marketed, tapping into a circumscribed but highly lucrative consumer base that has long benefited from a legally protected, racially segregated safe space for white narcotics consumption. The connecting thread for the contemporary white opioid crisis, therefore, is white race as a ghost variable in addiction neuroscience and in its pharmaceutical and biotechnological translation.",2020,Social Issues,1

This study examines the impact of intellectual property protection on green technology innovation, constructing a progressive difference-in-differences model using 849 listed manufacturing firms panel data from 2007 to 2019 and taking the Chinese Intellectual Property Rights model cities as a quasi-natural experiment. Our study finds that the pilot policy significantly enhances corporate green innovation. When considering heterogeneity, the policy treatment effect is more remarkable for large firms, state-owned enterprises, and industries where technology can be easily imitated. Moreover, the mediating effect shows that the policy promotes green innovation by encouraging firms' research and development cooperation and increasing human capital levels. This study proposes that policymakers should reinforce intellectual property protection, encourage companies to be better and bigger, and emphasize the intermediary function of open innovation and human capital in green technology innovation.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Clearing Opacity Through Machine Learning,; TRADE SECRETS; PATENTS; RISK; INNOVATION; PRIVACY; HEALTH; LESSONS; QUEST; LAW; AGE,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning represent powerful tools in many fields, ranging from criminal justice to human biology to climate change. Part of the power of these tools arises from their ability to make predictions and glean useful information about complex real-world systems without the need to understand the workings of those systems. But these machine-learning tools are often as opaque as the underlying systems, whether because they are complex, nonintuitive, deliberately kept secret, or a synergistic combination of those three factors. A burgeoning literature addresses challenges arising from the opacity of machine-learning systems. This literature has largely focused on the benefits and difficulties of providing information to lay individuals, such as citizens impacted by algorithm-driven government decisions. In this Essay, we explore the potential of machine learning to clear opacity that is, to help drive scientific understanding of the frequently complex and nonintuitive real-world systems that machine-learning algorithms examine. Using examples drawn from cutting-edge scientific research, we argue machine-learning algorithms can advance fundamental scientific knowledge and that deliberate secrecy around machine-learning tools restricts that learning enterprise.",2021,Government & Law,1
Who Controls the National Academic Promotion System: An Analysis of Power Distribution in Poland,academic promotion; academic degree; higher education law; power structures; social order; MARKET; LAWS,"In studying the performance of academic systems, one often tries to find out-by inspecting some well-defined parameters-how specific changes in the legal system influence the volume and quality of desired outputs, such as publications, patents, or alumni. This mechanistic approach neglects the fact that the main actors in this spectacle are not passive, but have their own priorities, and actively self-organize in response to any changes in their professional environment. In this contribution, we investigate such collective social behavior using the data for academic promotions in Poland in the years 2011 to 2020. Focusing on degrees higher than the PhD, we analyzed over 12,500 habilitation (= higher doctorate) and over 3,000 professorship applications, extracting personal data on academic promotion panel membership along with official roles on the panels. These details were then linked with data on the personal make-up of three consecutive terms of the central body overseeing academic promotions in Poland, Centralna Komisja do Spraw Stopni i Tytulow (Central Board for Degrees and Titles). As a result, we were able to identify a privileged group of individuals who controlled a substantial majority of academic promotions beyond the PhD degree by virtue of being part of the Central Board. We found that this relatively small group of academics held dominant control over academic promotions by repeatedly serving on promotion panels. Thus, despite the well-meaning intentions of the reformists who had designed it, the Polish system of academic promotions in the past decade can hardly be regarded as based on pure merit.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics,1
Biobanking of human biological material and the principle of noncommercialisation of the human body and its parts,commercialisation; donation; ethics; human biological material; law; COMMERCIAL USE; TISSUE; INFORMATION; BLOOD,"The prohibition of commercialisation of the human body and its parts is not applied consistently and suffers from many exceptions in the human biological material (HBM) market. Examples include the possibility of patenting certain HBM-derived products and their commercial marketing or payments for blood donations. Thus, the current practice of marketing HBM-derived products makes the altruistic donor most vulnerable to exploitation while being deprived of benefits. There seem to be two ways to improve this state of affairs. The first is to apply consistently the prohibition of commercialisation of the body and its parts to commercially marketed tissue and cell products as well. This would require limiting the possibility of financial gain associated with the processing, distribution and sale of HBM-based products. Such a solution, however, does not seem to gain wide acceptance or have a chance of implementation in the near future. Therefore, introducing more transparent rules and greater donor empowerment seems more reasonable by exempting HBM from the ban on commercialisation under certain conditions and with clear limitations.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences,1
"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, ROBOTS AND UNEMPLOYMENT: EVIDENCE FROM OECD COUNTRIES",Technological Unemployment; Skill-biased Technical Change; Labor Market Polarization; Robots; Artificial Intelligence; Robotics; Okun's Law; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; JOB POLARIZATION; EMPLOYMENT; INNOVATION,"Investigating the relation between artificial intelligence, robots and unemployment on a panel of 33 OECD countries covering the 2005-2017 period, we find that a 10% increase in the stock of industrial robots is associated with a 0.42 point increase in the unemployment rate. For artificial intelligence (AI), we use patents as a proxy of AI-related technological capabilities and find a positive correlation with the aggregated unemployment rate, albeit statistically weaker than the one found for robots. We then run the regressions on unemployment rates differentiated by education and age, and observe highly heterogeneous effects between groups. For example, the effect of robots is 2.5 times greater for 25.34 year-olds below upper secondary education levels than for the 55.64 year-olds with a tertiary degree. Lastly, the effect of robots is strongest on the unemployment rate of people with a medium level of education, providing some evidence that robots could contribute to the polarization of the labor market. A similar effect is found with AI, but the results are less robust than for robots.",2022,Business & Economics,1

In this paper, the Seed Commons framework is applied to show how the conflicting norms and rules of the international regime complex surrounding seeds shape the scope of action for Seed Commons in Germany and the Philippines. The analysis shows that the patent and variety protection regimes have strongly influenced the design of national seed marketing and threaten to outlaw practices of Seed Commons. Despite limited practical impact for Seed Commons initiatives (so far), the norms of the Nagoya Protocol and the Seed Treaty have contributed to exceptions in national seed marketing law that provide essential scope of action for Seed Commons initiatives in Europe and the Philippines.

PRIVATE DELEGATION OUTSIDE OF EXECUTIVE SUPERVISION,; ,"Over the past decade, the Supreme Court has reworked the landscape of executive branch supervision. The Court has both addressed the scope of executive officials subject to the Constitution's selection constraints in the Appointments Clause and imposed limits on the tenure protections that Congress can bestow on senior agency officials. This refashioning re-trenched the functionalist approach that had taken hold in the twentieth century and culminated in the Court's 1989 blessing of independent coun-sels with authority to investigate the Executive Branch from within. One less-explored question is the degree to which federally prescribed tasks can be carried out by individuals other than government officials. In other words, to what extent can Congress authorize private actors to per-form statutorily required components of governmental operations such as arbitration of disputes, creation of standards tied to governmental require-ments, fact-gathering, or the performance of evaluations where the result leads to qualification or disqualification for a government service or bene-fit? Justice Alito raised this key question in a 2015 dispute involving Amtrak, when he questioned the constitutional basis for Amtrak to set metrics and standards governing passenger railroad services operating as a private actor. The question continues to plague government practice, as Congress at times prefers to employ private boards or commissions to set standards such as the quantity and type of routine pediatric services that health insurers must cover under the Affordable Care Act.From the time of the establishment of the first Congress in 1789, the federal government has employed private actors for numerous tasks. Many of those responsibilities, however, involved the provision of contractual services such as measuring the quantities of imported goods, valuing im-ported items, constructing government buildings, or providing expertise such as autopsy analysis. In modern practice, private boards or arbitration panels have at times made decisions that ultimately bind the rights or ob-ligations of private parties or that establish the substantive content for government mandates. Is there a meaningful, constitutional distinction between the early versus modern acts? What was the understanding at the time of early practice of the limits, if any, that should govern the types of tasks Congress assigned to private actors? Does the non-officer status of private actors free them from constitutional appointments and oaths con-straints? Or is there an irreducible minimum of core governmental au-thority that cannot be delegated to private actors and that must instead be exercised by governmental actors subject to the Constitution's oath and appointments accountability mechanisms?This Article will unpack some of those constitutional complexities by examining the early federal practice of delegating adjudicative patent de-terminations to private experts, which the Supreme Court briefly consid-ered in its most recent review of executive direction of governmental de-terminations. Specifically, the position of the patent commissioner, first created by Congress in 1836, was bound by fact-findings of private expert panels when denying patent applications. The Court implicitly suggested last year, in United States v. Arthrex, 141 S. Ct. 1970, 1988 (2021), that this practice did not undermine the modern presidential supervisory structure that the Court went on to mandate for the contemporary patent office because the 1836 panels consisted of just private experts, not officers. What implications, if any, does such a view hold for the scope of power or duties that private actors can exercise outside of the control or supervision of the Constitution, the President, and any constitutional accountability mechanisms purportedly constraining power? Just three years after the 1836 boards' creation, Congress went on to eliminate them and transfer their duties to a federal judge. But evidence suggests that policy consider-ations rather than constitutional concerns drove this development.Although Congress and implicitly the Court apparently have concluded that the binding fact-finding authority of the early boards did not disrupt presidential executive supervision, the evidence suggests that this super-ficially significant power really was not viewed as constituting core sov-ereign authority. The Executive Branch today has signed off on far broader private delegation of a potentially constitutionally distinct character. This Article will uncover some of those distinctions and explore how the early view of permissible private delegation, implicitly endorsed by the Supreme Court in 2021, differs substantially from some of the private arbitration and other binding private power that Congress and the Executive Branch have normalized today. The constitutional concerns over too much private delegation raised by jurists such as Justice Alito merit further exploration and may call into question several current governmental practices.",2022,Government & Law,1

It is patent that opinions of students about the three factors (support, rejection and acceptance) that compose the construct of attitudes towards same-sex couples as a family structure, differ greatly depending on the positive or negative nature of these components. In conclusion, in relation to the dimension pertaining to rejection of same-sex couples as a family entity, we derived a configuration determined by 1 of the 4 predictor variables. In this case, gender was the only one of the 4 variables considered to support formation of a profile.

A network pharmacology approach to explore active compounds and pharmacological mechanisms of a patented Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of endometriosis,; EXPRESSION,"Objective Endometriosis is a common benign disease in women of reproductive age. Qu's formula (QUF) is a patented Chinese herbal medicine for treating endometriosis that has been proven to be effective in treating and preventing the recurrence of endometriosis. This study is aimed to discover its molecular mechanism and to explore the potential drug Methods A QUF target and endometriosis-related gene set was identified by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) and Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular Mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine (BATMAN-TCM) databases and five disease-gene databases. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established to discover the potential mechanism. MalaCards was searched for targets and signaling pathways related to endometriosis, and the search results were also used to identify the key factors in QUF. Molecular docking was performed to visualize the interactions between the effective molecules and proteins encoded by critical genes. Cell experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to further validate the therapeutic effects of the active compounds in QUF on endometriosis. Results A compound-target network with 117 nodes (94 genes and 23 active compounds) and 224 edges was generated. The results of GO and KEGG analyses indicated that QUF could act by regulating the immune response, apoptosis and proliferation, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis. VEGFA, CXCL8, CCL2, IL1B and PTGS2 were selected for molecular docking analysis from two critical subnetworks with high correlation scores in MalaCards, and the active compounds of QUF had binding potential and high affinity for them. The mRNA expression levels of CCL2, IL1B and PTGS2-significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. MD simulations showed that the combinations of quercetin and these proteins were relatively stable. Conclusion The network pharmacological strategy integrates molecular docking to unravel the molecular mechanism by which QUF protects against endometriosis. Our findings not only confirm the clinical effectiveness of QUF but also provide a foundation for further experimental study.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
iPAPP: study protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing safety and efficacy of intravenous paracetamol and indomethacin for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants,acute renal failure; clinical pharmacology; clinical trials; neonatal intensive & critical care; neonatology; protocols & guidelines; RISK-FACTORS; CLOSURE; IBUPROFEN; HEMORRHAGE; RESISTANT,"Introduction Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) causes severe morbidity in premature infants. Although the use of indomethacin is the standard therapy for PDA, it is sometimes not applicable because of its adverse effects, such as renal and platelet dysfunctions. Paracetamol has emerged as an alternative to indomethacin owing to its excellent safety profile in infants. Of the recently reported case series and clinical trials on the use of paracetamol for PDA, there are few reports in Japan on paracetamol use in preterm infants. Furthermore, indications for the use of paracetamol for PDA have not been approved for use in PDA. While the safety of intravenous paracetamol therapy in case series of preterm infants treated for haemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) has been reported, studies which were conducted to compare paracetamol to indomethacin are limited. We, therefore, intend to investigate the hypothesis that intravenous administration of paracetamol has superior safety over indomethacin. Methods and analysis Multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial for intravenous administration of paracetamol for PDA in preterm infants. The inclusion criteria are (1) hsPDA, (2) gestational age from 24 to 34 weeks and birth weight (BW) from 500 to 2000 g, (3) enrolment between 24 hours and 7 days from birth and (4) obtaining parental consent. The primary outcome is renal dysfunction within 48 hours from the last dose of the study drug. Enrolled patients fulfilling all the inclusion criteria are randomly allocated to either intravenous paracetamol or intravenous indomethacin. This trial requires 110 patients. Ethics and dissemination The clinical trial would follow Japan's Clinical Trials Act. The trial protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Review Board of Saitama Medical University (approval number: 222001). A written informed consent would be obtained from one of the parents. The results are expected to be published in a scientific journal.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,1
Static and dynamic behaviours of a self-expanding nitinol stent real contact area within a PTFE catheter: A multiscale approach,Self-expanding nitinol stent; Frictional behaviour law; X-ray tomography; Topographical analysis; Persson's contact theory; ALLOYS; MODEL,"Current research on self-expanding super-elastic nitinol stents is mainly focused on designing geometries suited to the human venous and arterial systems. This study specifically considers a patented one-piece double cross-sectional stent designed to address venous stenosis affecting the vena cava, iliac veins, and their bifurcations. Before its placement within the vein, numerous tribological challenges arise as the stent slides along the guide-wire (so-called catheter). These are mainly connected to the lack of knowledge related to (i) its frictional behaviour and (ii) the level of contact pressure linked to the unknown real contact area between the compressed stent and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) catheter. This paper describes an original multi-scale approach, based on the Persson's contact theory, that allows determination of (i) the contact pressure, (ii) the evolution of the real contact area, and (iii) the shear stresses at the interface during the stent sliding. A topographical optimization criterion will finally be provided, enabling control of both friction and stick-slip phenomena at the stent-catheter interface.",2024,Engineering,1
The Importance of Being First: Economic and Non-economic Dimensions of Inventorship in American and German Law,; ,"This Article examines the right to be acknowledged as the first inventor of a new technology in patent law. Technological inventions usually result from cumulative research and development, and several people sometimes arrive at the same invention almost simultaneously. However, only one person is usually considered to be the inventor,  and receives all the credit and honor.This Article focuses on the legal systems of Germany and the United States, comparing how they conceptualize the right to be seen as inventor. These systems have developed in substantially different philosophical and cultural climates: while the German legal system has been deeply influenced by Kantian and Hegelian thought, the American legal system has been inspired more strongly by liberal and utilitarian ideas. These two schools of philosophical thought have different perspectives on the relationship between personal identity and work; while the German tradition emphasizes the deeply personal relation between individuals and their work, the Anglo-Saxon approach is, in general, more instrumentalist and utilitarian with regard to work.One way in which these differences express themselves is the different ways in which the right to be acknowledged as the first inventor is understood and regulated. The right to be acknowledged as the first inventor is deeply connected with one's identity as a professional, whether an engineer, technician, or scientist. On the other hand, this right does not necessarily have pecuniary significance. Hence, the protection of the right to be considered as the first inventor allows a glimpse into the different visions of identity and work found in these legal systems.This Article examines to what extent German and American legal systems recognize and protect the right to be perceived as the first inventor. It demonstrates that the two legal systems differ profoundly in the ways they perceive and protect the right to be considered as the first inventor. True to its visions of professional dignity, German law carefully protects this right, independently from any pecuniary interests. In contrast, American law grants a remarkably weak protection to the right to be considered as the first inventor, focusing primarily on its monetary aspects. Hence, one can here discover different visions of the role of individuals in society, and specifically of the role of individuals as creators and not just consumers. What is at stake here is whether questions of honor, dignity, and symbolic property, above and beyond material benefits, are recognized as playing a role in the economic system.",2022,Government & Law,1
How does the development of the digital economy affect innovation output? Exploring mechanisms from the perspective of regional innovation systems,Digital economy; Innovation output; Regional innovation system; Innovation cooperation; R & D element flow; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; PATENT-STATISTICS; KNOWLEDGE BASES; GROWTH; INTERNATIONALIZATION; TRANSITIONS; MIGRATION; INTERNET; INDUSTRY,"This paper explored the paradigm shift in spatial innovation dynamics driven by the rapid emergence of the digital economy (DIGE) through the lens of the regional innovation system (RIS). By integrating DIGE, RIS, and innovation output into a unified analytical framework, this study examined the impact and mechanisms of DIGE on innovation output across 330 Chinese cities from 2011 to 2020. Results show that DIGE development significantly contributes to innovation output. This contribution is mediated by DIGE's strengthening of the RIS, primarily through its facilitation of integration into innovation networks and enhancement of the innovation environment. Regional heterogeneities are evident in the innovation-promoting influence of DIGE, with less developed cities, cities with underdeveloped infrastructure, and smaller cities benefiting more significantly. While the direct impact of DIGE on large central cities is subtle, their pivotal positions enable them to radiate and disseminate innovation spillovers to connected cities through extensive cooperative networks. This study underscored the potential of leveraging DIGE, especially in disadvantaged regions, to cultivate robust and synergistic RIS and act as catalysts for augmented innovation output.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Market insights exploration and product technology build-up: latecomer firms' catch-up strategies,Latecomer firms; catch-up and surpassing strategies; strategic paths; market insights; technology build-up; INNOVATION CAPABILITY; ORIENTATION; PATENTS; TAIWAN; MODEL,"Prior research on catch-up strategies often provides insights from the technology-related perspective and ignores some non-technological factors. Through the multi-case study of China's smartphone industry, we develop a theoretical framework explaining how latecomer firms catch up through diverse strategic choices. We identify two strategic paths that latecomer firms follow to catch up and surpass the incumbents. One path is to explore new business opportunities via deep market insights and then combine them with building up product technologies. Another path is from product technology build-up to market insights exploration. Firms following this path usually start with building up essential technologies and act as fast followers for new market insights. Then, as they continue developing their technological strengths, these firms devote efforts to improving their ability to capture new market insights. This study challenges the 'first imitation, then innovation model' discussed in the literature and shows that latecomer firms can pursue cutting-edge innovations in their early activities. The research also shows that, unlike previous studies, the technology build-up is not the only path to help latecomers catch up and challenge incumbent leaders.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Ferroportin-inhibitor salt: patent evaluation WO2018192973,Iron overload; ferroportin inhibitors; hepcidin mimicking; agonists; polymorphs; hemochromatosis; thalassemia; HEPCIDIN,"Introduction Iron is a crucial element necessary for blood formation in the body and its normal growth. However, irregular metabolism of iron due to absence of an elimination mechanism may deposit excess iron in the organs (iron overload) leading to metabolic disorders. Interactions between the iron regulatory peptide hormone, hepcidin and the iron exporter ferroportin plays major role in regulating the iron metabolism. Mutations in the ferroportin encoding genes, and dysregulation of hepsidin production often results in iron overload resulting in conditions like hemochromatosis, beta-thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia. Until today, there is no efficacious treatment available for managing iron overload targeting ferroportin inhibition via oral administration. Areas Covered Novel salts of substituted benzoimidazole compounds useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of iron overload are claimed. These compounds act as hepcidin mimetic and inhibit the ferroportin thereby preventing iron overload. The claimed actives are useful in the treatment of disease conditions such as neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases triggered by iron overload. Preclinical studies of these salts on mouse model are also discussed. Expert Opinion Prevention and/or treatment of iron overload is critical. The claimed compounds are the first oral drug candidate to treat iron overload and reach the pre-clinical development stage.",2021,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Effects of Medicare Part D coverage gap closure on utilization of branded and generic drugs,coverage gap; generic entry; health insurance; Medicare Part D; prescription drugs; BEHAVIOR; DEMAND,"The Affordable Care Act included a provision to gradually eliminate the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap between 2011 and 2020, which substantially lower medication costs in the gap. Using 2007-2016 Medicare claims data, we estimate how filling the gap affects individuals' out-of-pocket spending and medication use, separately for branded and generic drugs. One important difficulty in estimating the policy impact is that around the same time, many blockbuster drugs commonly used by the Medicare population experienced patent expiration and began to see generic entry. Because generic entries affected different therapeutic classes at different times, we run difference-in-differences models by therapeutic category at the beneficiary-month level to isolate the effect of the gap closure from that of generic entry. Overall, we find that filling the gap substantially reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased the use of branded drugs, which had larger discount rates during the analysis period. Beneficiaries reaching the gap, at older ages, or with comorbidities experienced larger reduction in out-of-pocket spending. We show that without accounting for generic entry, the effect of filling the coverage gap on medication use is underestimated for branded drugs and overestimated for generic drugs.",2023,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,1
lncRNA DLEU2 accelerates gastric cancer growth by downregulating miR-30a-5p,DLEU2; gastric cancer; miR-30a-5p; proliferation; INHIBITS CELL-PROLIFERATION; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; METASTASIS; INVASION,"Introduction: lncRNA DLEU2 has been indicated to act a crucial role in the bioprocess of cancer. But, the role and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA DLEU2 in gastric cancer (GC) remain unknown. Methods: The correlation of DLEU2 or miR-30a-5p with the clinical parameters and outcomes of GC patents was implemented by TCGA cohort. Cell viability and invasion were estimated by MTT and Transwell assays. The interplay between DLEU2 and miR-30a-5p was confirmed by a luciferase report assay. The effects of DLEU2 on miR-30a-5p or MMP2/9 were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results: We found that the enhanced expression of DLEU2 was linked to the pathological stage and poor survival in GC patients. Overexpressing DLEU2 prompted the cell proliferation and invasion of AGS cells, but silencing DLEU2 weakened these effects in MKN-28 cells. In addition, DLEU2 could negatively modulate and be bound with miR-30a-5p, which could counteract DLEU2-caused cell proliferation. High expression of miR-30a-5p was linked to a favorable survival in patients with GC. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that lncRNA DLEU2 could favor the growth of GC by downregulating miR-30a-5p.",2020,Immunology,1
"Convertible, multiple and hidden: The inventive lives of women's sport and activewear 1890-1940",citizenship; clothing; gender; invention; secret; sport; HISTORY,"Who gets to be 'sporty' and active in public is an enduring topic of socio-political debate. Disparities in participation continue from limited access, support and funding to ill-fitting equipment and clothing. This article focuses on the latter. Women have long been disproportionally restricted and harassed in public space not only in relation to how, where and when they move but also what they wear. I approach this issue via a unique data source - global clothing inventions for sport and athletic activities (1890-1940). Analysing convertible, multiple and hidden clothing patents, by and for women, reveals how inventors tackled ongoing socio-political restrictions to women's freedom of movement from the ground up and, often secretly, from the inside out. I suggest these data might be read as acts of resistance, enabling wearers to move and inhabit spaces in new ways, engage in a wider range of activities and make claims to equal public participation and mobility rights. These lesser-known clothing inventions invite us below the surface of conventional sporting histories, expand ideas around the creative possibilities of sport and activewear, and spark imaginaries of what other kinds of inclusive and inventive athletic identities might be possible.",2024,Sociology,1

Interestingly, while both IPR and scientific knowledge inherently promote cooperation, stronger regulatory environments may diminish the effectiveness of IPR protections, suggesting a potential substitution effect.Practical implicationsThe study offers actionable insights for policymakers in developing regions to help them craft more effective policies for collaboration in innovation that consider the balancing act between regulatory quality and other NIS elements.Originality/valueThis research shifts focus from the conventional analysis of how developing countries attract collaboration from developed nations to how they can foster innovation among themselves, providing a unique perspective on the interaction between institutional factors and innovation capabilities within the Latin American context.",2024,Business & Economics,1
New Treatments in Rheumatology: Biosimilars,Biosimilar; Switching; Interchangeable; Immunogenicity; Reference product; Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act; DOUBLE-BLIND; INFLIXIMAB; CT-P13,"Purpose of reviewBiosimilar versions of biologic agents have become increasingly available over the past decade. The framework for regulatory approval has been well established in the USA and Europe, and many biosimilars for use in oncology, rheumatology, dermatology, and inflammatory bowel disease treatment have been approved. Although the utilization of biosimilars has led to substantial cost savings in European countries, this has not occurred in the USA.Recent findingsIn this review, we explore several reasons for the limited uptake of biosimilars in the USA. Discounts and rebates to pharmacy benefits managers and patent litigation are major impediments. Furthermore, physicians and patients in the USA continue to express concerns that biosimilars do not have comparable safety and efficacy, despite abundant scientific evidence to the contrary. The Kaiser and Veterans Administration systems have successfully countered these obstacles and achieved dramatic cost savings as a result. The Kaiser experience illustrates the importance of including prescribing physicians as well as patients as stakeholders in the decision to implement use of biosimilars.SummaryHowever, major changes in the operation of the US health system must also occur for the full potential for cost savings to be realized with use of biosimilars as substitutes for our revolutionary but extremely expensive, biologic medications.",2020,Rheumatology,1
Investments in the imaginary: commercial drone speculations and relations,drones; unmanned; speculation; futures; airspace; GOVERNANCE; FUTURES,"Drones are increasingly understood and imagined as important actors, inhabiting and transforming aerial space. From their entrenched establishment within battlefield operations, drones have spawned into a diverse ecosystem of platforms and applications, increasingly punctuating domestic urban airspace. While occupying a status as exemplars of urban innovation, the drone poses, and remains bound to, a range of techno-cultural contestations from challenges around airspace integration, to concerns around privacy, safety and pollution. Thinking with commercial drone futures, and specifically the logistics sector, this article interrogates the role of speculation in this unfolding techno-landscape. In so doing we turn to two key sites through which the drone is anticipated - namely patents and adverts as lenses through which to investigate projected visualisations underpinning the emergent, envisioned and anticipated drone. We argue that such drone speculations do not simply and solely envision new means of circulating goods, people and information, but rather embody and act to promote a particular set of aerial desires and social relations. Critically unpacking envisioned notions of frictionless mobility, instant consumption, and the appropriation of vertical spaces and spectra, we argue that such speculative sites and practices importantly participate in a techno-fetishist agenda positing drone technology as a privileged and panacea agent of futurity, while often eliding its implications.",2021,International Relations; Government & Law; Sociology,1

Development and characterization of composition-equivalent formulations to the Sandostatin LAR® by the solvent evaporation method,Long-term controlled release; Microencapsulation; Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres; Peptide; CONTROLLED-RELEASE; PLGA MICROSPHERES; PROTEIN INSTABILITY; LEUPROLIDE ACETATE; POLYMER MICROBEADS; MICROCLIMATE PH; PEPTIDE; OCTREOTIDE; ACYLATION; ACID,"Sandostatin long-acting release (R) (SLAR) is a long-acting injectable somatostatin analogue formulation composed of octreotide encapsulated in glucose-initiated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres. Despite the end of patent protection, SLAR remains resistant to generic competition likely due to complexity of production process, the uniqueness of the glucose star polymer, and the instability of octreotide in the formulation. Here, we describe development of glucose-PLGA-based composition-equivalent to SLAR formulations prepared by double emulsion-solvent evaporation method and the effect of variations in encapsulation variables on release kinetics and other formulation characteristics. The following encapsulation variables were adjusted at constant theoretical loading of 7.0% peptide: PLGA concentration, pH of inner water phase, and stirring rate. After final drying, the microspheres were examined with and without annealing at 50 degrees C under vacuum for 3 days. The loading and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of octreotide acetate, manufacturing yield, and in vitro drug release kinetics in PBStc (10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1% triethyl citrate and 0.02% sodium azide at pH 7.4) were determined by UPLC. The in vitro release and acylation kinetics of octreotide for the solvent evaporation formulations prepared were similar to SLAR although the initial burst was slightly higher. Key formulation steps identified to maximize microsphere yield and minimize residual solvent and initial burst release included (a) addition of acetic acid to the peptide before preparation and (b) annealing the microspheres under vacuum after drying. Controlled release octreotide formulations prepared and investigated in this study could provide a better understanding of the effect of production variables on release performance and supply information useful for making progress in manufacturing of SLAR generic equivalents.",2022,Instruments & Instrumentation; Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
leIdentification of linoleic acid as an antithrombotic component of Wenxin Keli via selective inhibition of p-selectin-mediated platelet activation,Wenxin Keli; Systems pharmacology; Linoleic acid; Platelet activation; Thrombosis; ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; VIRUS-INFECTION; WORKING GROUP; METAANALYSIS; HEMOSTASIS; MECHANISMS; THERAPY; EXTRACT,"Atrial fibrillation significantly increases the risk of thromboembolism and stroke. Wenxin Keli (WXKL) is a widely used Chinese patent medicine against arrhythmia but if it has antithrombotic activity is unknown. Since platelet activation is a critical factor in thrombosis and the key target for many antithrombotic drugs, this study aims to demonstrate the antithrombotic efficacy of WXKL. In vitro platelet activation experiments showed that WXKL significantly inhibited platelet adhesion and aggregation. The potential active monomers in WXKL were screened by in silico prediction and in vitro platelet aggregation/adhesion assays. From WXKL chemical fractions and more than 40 monomers, linoleic acid (LA) was identified as the strongest antiplatelet compound. Oral administration of WXKL (1.2 g/kg/day) and LA (50 mg/kg/day) for 7 days significantly improved FeCl3-induced carotid thrombus formation in ICR mice without prolonging bleeding time. Flow cytometry showed that both WXKL and LA inhibited the release of p-selectin after platelet activation. ELISA showed that WXKL and LA also inhibited the expression of 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha in plasma of mice with thrombus, but had no obvious effect on the expression of TXB2. WXKL inhibited platelet activation by broadly inhibiting the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phospholipase C (PLC) beta 3. In contrast, LA only inhibited the phosphorylation of PLC beta 3. In conclusion, WXKL and its active component LA showed good antiplatelet and antithrombotic efficacy in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, the multicomponent Chinese medicine WXKL acts on multiple targets in the platelet activation pathway whereas its active monomer linoleic acid acts specifically on phospholipase C beta 3.",2022,Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

Under the background of double carbon, innovation in GBTs have become the general trend of sus-tainable development in the construction industry. Inter-organizational collaboration can not only of great significance to take advantage of innovation resources of the stakeholders involved, but also has a pivotal role in reducing costs and containing associated risks. However, little research has shed light on the underlying patterns and complex mechanisms of collaborative relationships in GBTs innovation. The aim of this study is to explore the structural characteristics, evolution laws and patterns of GBTs collaborative innovation through longitudi-nally tracking research on China's construction industry, and in turn, reveal the complicated collaboration mechanism of stakeholders in inter-organization. Therefore, this study establishes the GBTs collaborative innovation network model via patents in DII database. Combined with social network analysis method, the temporal evolution characteristic and spatial evolution pattern of the GBTs collaborative innovation network are quantitatively revealed. The results demonstrate that GBTs collaborative innovation gradually expands with a three-stage trend in 2006-2021. State Grid Corp. China in particular exerts a significant influence and collab-orative innovation among various stakeholder, such as the general contractors and research institutions becomes the dominant force. In addition, the geospatial distribution is quite different. Beijing has a central position and is continuously strengthening. In terms of spatial pattern evolution, most of the eastern regions with high breadth -high depth are not only the center of information exchange, but also the bridge for inter-provincial resource exchanges. This study enriches the existing literature on the innovation in GBTs and helps us better understand the evolutionary mechanism of GBTs collaborative innovation and provides a useful reference for stakeholders to establish relational contracts in innovation in GBTs. It is of great significance to allocate innovation resources more efficiently and promote the sustainable development of the construction industry.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Preferences and Support for Psychedelic Policies and Practices Among Those Using Psychedelics,Psychedelics; policy; community; preferences; community-based research; PSILOCYBIN,"Legal, scientific, and social landscapes for psychedelics are changing rapidly. Differences of opinion exist among key stakeholders regarding regulatory control, models of provisioning psychedelic therapy, and medicalization, decriminalization, and/or legalization policies. We assessed the policy preferences of people using psychedelics naturalistically (N = 1221) to understand how they aligned and differed with institutional entities and existing psychedelic policies. Three quarters of participants would support decriminalization and legalization. On average, participants strongly supported individuals being legally able to grow and possess psychedelic plants and/or fungi for personal consumption. Trends included more support for natural over synthetic substances, self-production and consumption over gifting, gifting over sales, and administration of psychedelics with therapeutic support than without therapeutic support. Participants were concerned about pharmaceutical-like policy models, including patents of natural and synthetic psychedelic compounds. Participants were mostly from the State of Michigan, though geographical differences were minor. Those who identified as a psychedelic guide, educator, or therapist had small yet extensive differences from those who did not. As psychedelic liberalization continues to advance, it is critical for policymakers to consider these preferences to ensure laws provide safe and equitable access to these substances and appropriate medical support for their use.",2023,Psychology; Substance Abuse,1
The Effects of Branch Spacing and Number on the Uplift Bearing Capacity of a New Squeezed Multiple-Branch Pile: A Numerical Simulation Analysis,; SOIL,"The squeezed multiple-branch pile is a variable section pile that was built by adding a bearing branch cavity to a constant section pile using expansion and extrusion equipment. It is widely used in engineering practice for its high bearing capacity, small settlement deformation, high economic benefits, strong adaptability, and simple pile forming process. In this paper, a new type of squeezed multiple-branch pile is proposed and its forming tool is invented. The forming tool of the pile has applied for an invention patent and is authorized by the China National Intellectual Property Administration. Multiple groups of comparison models of the new squeezed multiple-branch piles are established by using FLAC3D numerical simulation software to investigate the influence of the number and spacing of branches on the bearing mechanism in response to uplift load. The results indicated that the number and spacing of branches have a significant effect on the uplift bearing capacity, load-displacement curves, side friction resistance, and stress distribution law in the new pile and soil around the pile. The suitable number and spacing of branches maximize the uplift bearing capacity and minimize the settlement of a single pile.",2023,Engineering,1

Trademarking firms are in one word more successful, which might motivate non-trademarking firms to adopt a trademark strategy. But this does not seem to be the case. The proportion of trademarking firms in the German business sector amounts to just 18%. This figure is quite low, given that nearly each firm has reputation to protect. But why does the vast majority of firms not have registered trademarks? Using a representative sample of German firms, the present paper links certain firm characteristics to a firm's propensity to register trademarks. The empirical results point to circumstances under which trademarks are significantly more often used: this is the case where a large distance between a firm and its customers exists, a firm's product quality is difficult to assess, a firm's products are characterised by a limited (but not strong) substitutability, and where a firm is engaged in R&D and introduces innovative products. Trademarks are considerably less frequently used if none of this is the case.",2020,Business & Economics,1
"Geometrical congruence, greedy navigability and myopic transfer in complex networks and brain connectomes",; ORGANIZATION; SIMILARITY; NAVIGATION,"We introduce in network geometry a measure of geometrical congruence (GC) to evaluate the extent a network topology follows an underlying geometry. This requires finding all topological shortest-paths for each nonadjacent node pair in the network: a nontrivial computational task. Hence, we propose an optimized algorithm that reduces 26 years of worst scenario computation to one week parallel computing. Analysing artificial networks with patent geometry we discover that, different from current belief, hyperbolic networks do not show in general high GC and efficient greedy navigability (GN) with respect to the geodesics. The myopic transfer which rules GN works best only when degree-distribution power-law exponent is strictly close to two. Analysing real networks-whose geometry is often latent-GC overcomes GN as marker to differentiate phenotypical states in macroscale structural-MRI brain connectomes, suggesting connectomes might have a latent neurobiological geometry accounting for more information than the visible tridimensional Euclidean. The manifold's geometry underlying the connectivity of a complex network determines its navigation ruled by the nodes distances in the geometrical space. In this work, the authors propose an algorithm which allows to uncover the relation between the measures of geometrical congruency and efficient greedy navigability in complex networks.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1

This article uses the dataset to generate novel descriptive analyses of the performance of Canada's trademark registration system and the behavior of applicants for registration, both independently and in comparison to the United States and Australia. These analyses suggest that Canada's trademark registration system is substantially underperforming other nations with respect to efficiency of examination, and that recent statutory and regulatory changes in Canadian trademark law may have the effect of masking or even exacerbating this underperformance while decreasing the reliability of the Canadian trademark registry as an authoritative guide to trademarks used in Canadian commerce.",2021,Government & Law,1
Evolutionary Analysis of Knowledge-Based Networks of the Electronic Information Industry from a Dual Innovation Perspective,knowledge-based network; dual innovation; evolution; TECHNOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION; COLLABORATION NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; COHERENCE; FIRMS,"It provides specific theoretical guidance to enhance the enterprise's independent innovation capabilities by studying the knowledge utilization and the evolution of innovation under different innovation strategies and revealing the law of innovation path. Based on the data of invention patents of 579 electronic information enterprises from 2010 to 2019, this paper constructs a knowledge-based network based on social network analysis to study the evolution process of density, centrality, and structural holes of knowledge. The evolution analysis of 3360 knowledge-based networks shows that the electronic information industry's overall knowledge integration capacity is in the middle and lower reaches. The widespread knowledge reliance in the electronic information industry is small, the industry is out of the 'capacity traps', and diversified development has gradually become a trend. At the same time, cross-domain knowledge reorganization is increasing. The results show that the overall knowledge reliance degree of enterprises applying an exploitative innovation strategy is deeper than that of enterprises applying an exploratory innovation strategy. The knowledge integration capabilities and cross-domain knowledge reorganization capabilities of enterprises applying exploratory innovation strategies are higher than those of enterprises applying exploitative innovation strategy.",2023,Mathematics,1

A sequence labeling model for catchphrase identification from legal case documents,Legal catchphrases; Catchphrase extraction; Keyphrase extraction; Legal analytics; Sequence tagging; BiGRU; CRF; Doc2Vec; QUERY EXPANSION; PATENT,"In a Common Law system, legal practitioners need frequent access to prior case documents that discuss relevant legal issues. Case documents are generally very lengthy, containing complex sentence structures, and reading them fully is a strenuous task even for legal practitioners. Having a concise overview of these documents can relieve legal practitioners from the task of reading the complete case statements. Legal catchphrases are (multi-word) phrases that provide a concise overview of the contents of a case document, and automated generation of catchphrases is a challenging problem in legal analytics. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised neural sequence tagging model for the extraction of catchphrases from legal case documents. Specifically, we show that incorporating document-specific information along with a sequence tagging model can enhance the performance of catchphrase extraction. We perform experiments over a set of Indian Supreme Court case documents, for which the gold-standard catchphrases (annotated by legal practitioners) are obtained from a popular legal information system. The performance of our proposed method is compared with that of several existing supervised and unsupervised methods, and our proposed method is empirically shown to be superior to all baselines.",2022,Computer Science; Government & Law,1
How to Efficiently Reduce the Carbon Intensity of the Heavy Industry in China? Using Quantile Regression Approach,carbon intensity; the heavy industry; quantile regression analysis; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; EMISSIONS,"This decoupling between carbon dioxide emissions and the heavy industry is one of the main topics of government managers. This paper uses the quantile regression approach to investigate the carbon intensity of China's heavy industry, based on 2005-2019 panel data. The main findings are as follows: (1) incentive-based environmental regulations have the greater impact on the carbon intensity in Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, Henan, Liaoning, and Shaanxi, because these provinces invest more in environmental governance and levy higher resource taxes; (2) the impact of mandatory environmental regulations on carbon intensity in Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangdong provinces is smaller, since these three provinces have the fewest enacted environmental laws and rely mainly on market incentives; (3) conversely, foreign direct investment has contributed most to carbon intensity reduction in Tianjin, Beijing, and Guangdong provinces, because these three have attracted more technologically advanced foreign-funded enterprises; (4) technological progress contributes more to the carbon intensity in the low quantile provinces, because these provinces have more patented technologies; (5) the carbon intensity of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia provinces is most affected by energy consumption structures because of their over-reliance on highly polluting coal.",2022,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
Temporary Eminent Domain,; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; TAKINGS; COMPENSATION; FOUNDATIONS,"Times of emergency call for drastic measures. These steps may include the physical takeover of privately-owned assets by the government for a certain period of time and for various purposes, aimed at addressing the state of emergency. When will such acts amount to a taking, and what compensation should be paid to the property owner? How do temporary physical appropriations during times of emergency diverge, if at all, from temporary takeovers in more ordinary times? The doctrinal and theoretical analysis of potential temporary takings has been done mostly in the context of non-physical government intervention with private property, such as when a local government imposes a temporary moratorium on land development until a certain condition is met. This Article focuses, however, on less investigated scenarios of temporary physical takeovers or other forms of government invasions. It seeks to identify the differences between a temporary invasion and a permanent occupation of property considered a per se taking under the Loretto rule. In so doing, this Article argues that while the alleged distinction between prevention of public harm and promotion of public benefit often proves untenable in evaluating whether a permanent government measure constitutes a taking, it might make more sense in exploring temporary acts. Temporary eminent domain referring here to various types of acts amounting to time-limited physical takings, even if not initially recognized as such by the government may diverge from permanent eminent domain in yet another key element: identifying the basis for just compensation. Under long established (although often criticized) rules, compensation for a permanent taking is based on identifying the fair market value of the rights taken, while ignoring the effects that the public use for which the underlying asset is taken might have on the property's long-term value. The allegedly parallel metric used in the case of temporary takings, one of fair rental value, may often prove inadequate, both practically and normatively. This Article argues that because of unique aspects of temporary physical takings, legal rules on compensation should often seek to identify lost profits or actual damage. Moreover, in some cases, in which there is a direct relation between the pre-appropriation use of the asset and its post-appropriation use by the government, just compensation might also be based on a certain portion of the value of the public use. This is especially so when the time -sensitive value of the asset during such public use is particularly high. On this point, the Article offers an analogy to rules pertaining to compulsory licenses for patents.",2021,Government & Law,1
The Effect of Service on Research Performance: A Study on Italian Academics in Management,academic citizenship; research performance; research excellence; service; multilevel model; moderation; RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY; UNIVERSITIES EVIDENCE; SCIENTIFIC TEAMS; RESEARCH QUALITY; UK; KNOWLEDGE; GENDER; ACCOUNTABILITY; DETERMINANTS; CITIZENSHIP,"Academics all over the world are feeling the increasing pressure to attain satisfactory research performance. Since research is not the only activity required of academics, though, the debate on how it may be coupled with other knowledge transfer activities like teaching, patenting, and dissemination has been captivating scholars interested in higher education. The literature is surprisingly silent about the interplay between research performance and other roles and tasks that faculty are expected to carry out, namely academic citizenship, intended as the service that they provide to their institution, to the scientific community, and to the larger society. Through a negative binomial regression conducted on 692 Italian academics in management, this paper investigates both the direct and moderating effect exerted by academic citizenship on the relationship between research performance in two subsequent evaluation exercises, thus advancing our knowledge of the relationship between research and service. Findings show that institutional service acts as a pure moderator, discipline-based service is a quasi-moderator, while public service exerts only a direct negative effect on research performance. In light of the emergent interplay between research and service, the necessity to boost reflection on academic citizenship is discussed and suggestions for its acknowledgement and advancement are formulated.",2021,Education & Educational Research,1
Formulation of Sustained Release Hydrophilic Matrix Tablets of Tolcapone with the Application of Sedem Diagram: Influence of Tolcapone's Particle Size on Sustained Release,hydrophilic matrix tablets; tolcapone; sustained release; particle size; SeDeM diagram; direct compression; EXPERT-SYSTEM; DRUG; PREFORMULATION; OPTIMIZATION; PARAMETERS; VARIABLES,"Hydrophilic matrix tablets are a type of sustained release dosage form characterized by distributing a drug in a matrix that is usually polymeric. Tolcapone is a drug that inhibits the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase. In recent years, it has been shown that tolcapone is a potent inhibitor of the amyloid aggregation process of the transthyretin protein, and acts by stabilizing the structure of the protein, reducing the progression of familial amyloid polyneuropathy. The main objective of this study was to obtain a sustained release tablet of tolcapone for oral administration with a preferred dosage regimen of 1 administration every 12 or 24 h and manufactured, preferably, by direct compression. The SeDeM Diagram method has been used for the formulation development of hydrophilic matrix tablets. Given the characteristics of tolcapone, the excipient selected for the formation of the polymeric matrix was a high viscosity hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Methocel(R)K100M CR). A decrease in the particle size of tolcapone resulted in a slower dissolution release of the formulation when the concentration of the polymer Methocel(R)K100M CR was below 29%. These surprising and novel results have given rise to patent number WO/2018/019997.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Correlation-aware Graph Data Augmentation with Implicit and Explicit Neighbors,Graph neural networks; citation graphs; graph data augmentation; implicit and explicit neighbors; ,"In recent years, there has been a significant surge in commercial demand for citation graph-based tasks, such as patent analysis, social network analysis, and recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for these tasks due to their remarkable performance in capturing topological graph information. However, GNNs' output results are highly dependent on the composition of local neighbors within the topological structure. To address this issue, we identify two types of neighbors in a citation graph: explicit neighbors based on the topological structure and implicit neighbors based on node features. Our primary motivation is to clearly define and visualize these neighbors, emphasizing their importance in enhancing graph neural network performance. We propose a Correlation-aware Network (CNet) to re-organize the citation graph and learn more valuable informative representations by leveraging these implicit and explicit neighbors. Our approach aims to improve graph data augmentation and classification performance, with the majority of our focus on stating the importance of using these neighbors, while also introducing a new graph data augmentation method. We compare CNet with state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNNs and other graph data augmentation approaches acting on GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CNet effectively extracts more valuable informative representations from the citation graph, significantly outperforming baselines. The code is available on public GitHub.(1)",2024,Computer Science,1

Who is triggering this process? This work addresses these compelling research questions by investigating the role of migrant inventors in the process of technological diversification. Immigrant inventors can indeed act as carriers of knowledge across borders and influence the direction of technological change. We test these latter propositions by using an original dataset of immigrant inventors in the context of European regions during the period 2003-201. Our findings show that: immigrant inventors generate positive local knowledge spillovers; they help their host regions to develop new technological specialisations; they trigger a process of unrelated diversification. Their contribution comes via two main mechanisms: immigrant inventors use their own personal knowledge (knowledge creation); they import knowledge from their home country to the host region (knowledge transfer). Their impact is maximised when their knowledge is not recombined with the local one (in mixed teams of inventors), but it is reused (in teams made by only migrant inventors). Our work contributes to the existing literature of regional diversification by providing fresh evidence of unrelated diversification for European regions and by identifying important agents of structural change. It also contributes to the literature of migration and innovation by adding fresh evidence on European regions and by unveiling some of the mechanisms of immigrants' knowledge transmission.",2023,Engineering; Business & Economics,1
"Impact of Patent(Amendment) Act, 2005 on Indian pharmaceutical industry with reference to R&D expenditure, profit, export and sales",; FIRM PROFITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; REFORMS,"The Indian pharmaceutical business is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical sector in terms of volume, but it ranks 14th in terms of value. The lower position in terms of value might be due to the fact that Indian pharmaceutical enterprises are mostly focused on low-cost generic pharmaceuticals, with a broad range of company sizes and product mix. Because of Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) restrictions, the Indian pharmaceutical business has undergone significant transformation since 1995. TRIPS ratification has had a considerable effect on Indian pharmaceutical industries. The effect of TRIPS on the Indian pharmaceutical industry's R&D Expenditure, profit, export and sales is examined using a dummy variable in this research. Various industrial performance drivers, such as knowledge-based resources and property-based resources, are considered. The research considers a sample of 25 Indian pharmaceutical enterprises over a twenty-five year period (1996-2020). The results show that the Indian pharmaceutical industry is significantly impacted by TRIPS compliance. The findings of this study also emphasize the relative impact of various company resources on the performance of Indian pharmaceutical enterprises. The results of this study will add to the expanding body of knowledge addressing the factors that influence the success of the Indian pharmaceutical sector in developing countries.",2022,Education & Educational Research,1
Pursuing justice or protecting local firms? Shenzhen courts move beyond judicial local protectionism,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT LITIGATION; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; CHINA; INNOVATION; APPROPRIABILITY; DETERMINANTS; SETTLEMENT; DECISIONS,"Emerging economies represent a vivid market for firms worldwide who are massively investing in R&D. This tendency is generating an increase in the number of intellectual property (IP) registrations and is expanding the markets for IP. However, emerging economies tend to show unfair judicial systems, being unable to ensure IP rights protection, and to allow companies to benefit from their inventions. China is one of the most important emerging economies, and both domestic and foreign companies are investing a considerable amount of money in R&D and IP activities, especially in innovative cities such as Shenzhen. In this study, we aim to investigate whether the Chinese judicial system, using the city of Shenzhen as our empirical context, is fair in protecting IP rights. We use data about IP litigations from 2014 to 2016, targeting the three most relevant outcomes: settlement, judgment, and the amount of damage awards recognized by the court. The study shows no evidence that Shenzhen courts rule in favor of local firms, and the findings show consistency regarding settlement, the winning probability in judgment, and amount of damage awards. Accordingly, we derive managerial implications demonstrating that Shenzhen is a very international arena and firms act following the classic strategic theories of innovation appropriation.",2020,Business & Economics,1
Multi-objective Bayesian shape optimization of an industrial hydrodynamic separator using unsteady Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations,Industrial hydrodynamic separator; Multi-objective Bayesian shape optimization; Multi-surrogate parallelization; Voronoi failure penalization; Eulerian-Lagrangian one-way coupling; uRANS; k-omega SST; RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY; ALGORITHM,"The shape of a hydrodynamic particle separator has been optimized using a parallelized and robust formulation of Bayesian optimization, with data from an unsteady Eulerian flow field coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking. The uncertainty due to the mesh, initial conditions, and stochastic dispersion in the Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations was minimized and quantified. This was then translated across to the error term in the Gaussian process model and the minimum probability of improvement infill criterion. An existing parallelization strategy was modified for the infill criterion and customized to prefer exploitation in the decision space. In addition, a new strategy was developed for hidden constraints using Voronoi penalization. In the approximate Pareto Front, an absolute improvement over the base design of 14% in the underflow collection efficiency and 10% in the total collection efficiency was achieved, which resulted in the filing of a patent.* The corresponding designs were attributed to the effective distribution of residence time between the trays via the removal of a vertical plume. The plume also reduced both efficiencies by creating a flow path in a direction that acted against effective settling. The concave down and offset tray shapes demonstrated the value of Bayesian optimization in producing useful and non-intuitive designs.",2024,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,1
Concretiser les droits des agriculteurs par l'adoption de legislations sui generis,Farmers' rights; Intellectual property rights; Sui generis legislations; Coexistence of legal regimes; Legal positivism; Plant genetic resources; Cultivated diversity; Equity; PLANT BREEDERS RIGHTS,"This article discusses the emergence and contours of farmers' rights to save, use, exchange and sell farm-saved seeds and other propagating materials, including from protected plant varieties, enshrined in Article 9 of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) to modulate the exclusive rights of patent and plant variety certificate holders. Second, the article raises the challenges of transposing farmers' rights to seed practices into national legislation to make these rights effective and enforceable. Indeed, when transposing these rights, World Trade Organization (WTO) member states must act within the scope of Article 27:3(b) of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which establishes international obligations for the protection of plant varieties through intellectual property rights. Finally, this paper argues that the adoption of sui generis plant variety protection legislation, as enshrined in both Article 27.3(b) of the TRIPS Agreement and Article 9 of the ITPGRFA, is a means of ensuring the coexistence at the national level of the international regime of farmers' rights and the international regime of intellectual property rights on plant varieties, as well as a solution to recognize the plurality of plant variety breeding methods and practices.",2022,Government & Law,1

When the USA withdrew from this agreement, key intellectual property clauses relevant to pharmaceuticals were suspended. These could be reinstated should the CPTPP Parties decide to do so.Methods This study uses two scenarios to cost the impact the CPTPP would have had on Thailand's 2020 hepatitis C treatment regime if Thailand joined the CPTPP and suspended clauses were reinstated.Results Joining the CPTPP could have increased the cost more than tenfold if suspended CPTPP clauses were reinstated and Thailand was not willing or able to issue compulsory licenses. Based on the 2020 budget, the price for this possible scenario could have reduced hepatitis C treatment coverage by 90%.Conclusions Acceding to trade agreements such as the CPTPP that require increasing intellectual property protection, could compromise Thailand's hepatitis C program and other national treatment programs reliant on affordable generic medicines. The CPTPP could also prevent Thailand from relying on its own pharmaceutical capabilities to manufacture medicines needed to sustain its treatment programs.",2024,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
Development of a Hydraulic Circulation Sub as a Tool to Prevent Mud Losses During Well Drilling,Drilling Equipment; Circulation Sub; Hydraulic Modeling; Bypass Valve; Drilling Mud-losses; Upstream Oil and Gas; OIL,"Fractured and cavernous rocks, as well as rocks with increased permeability, are prone to mud losses during oil and gas well drilling. Circulation subs areAa promising solution to mitigate mud and technological fluid losses in intervals ranging from 5 to 40 m3/h 3 /h by sealing the problematic interval. However, current circulation subs designs have notable drawbacks, including limited activation capabilities and usage scenario restrictions. This article provides a comprehensive analysis and characterization of the functional use of circulation subs, along with a qualitative comparative market analysis and patent search for devices activated by ball dropping, Ahydraulic, mechanical, and electromechanical means. The primary outcome of this research is the development of a functional hydraulic quick-acting activation device that addresses the shortcomings of existing designs. The device's design allow for future development of assemblies and optimization of their configurations to suit specific operating conditions. It can also serve as a protective measure for the downhole motor and telemetry system against harsh mechanical and chemical action during sealing. The device's limitations include pressure constraints and the need for flow rate adjustment. The article concludes with an overview of the developed hydraulically activated device and the results of qualitative bench tests, which demonstrate its functionality.",2024,Engineering,1
Three related topics on the periodic tables of elements,Periodic table; Werner; Pfeiffer; Mendeleev; 3D helical periodic table; Elementouch; Janet; Schaltenbrand; Nuclear periodic table; Nucletouch; Magic number; Shell model; MADELUNG RULE; CONFIGURATIONS,"A large variety of periodic tables of the chemical elements have been proposed. It was Mendeleev who proposed a periodic table based on the extensive periodic law and predicted a number of unknown elements at that time. The periodic table currently used worldwide is of a long form pioneered by Werner in 1905. As the first topic, we describe the work of Pfeiffer (Naturwiss. 8:984-991, 1920), who refined Werner's work and rearranged the rare-earth elements in a separate table below the main table for convenience. Today's widely used periodic table essentially inherits Pfeiffer's arrangements. Although long-form tables more precisely represent electron orbitals around a nucleus, they lose some of the features of Mendeleev's short-form table to express similarities of chemical properties of elements when forming compounds. As the second topic, we compare various three-dimensional helical periodic tables that resolve some of the shortcomings of the long-form periodic tables in this respect. In particular, we explain how the three-dimensional (3D) periodic tableElementouch(Maeno in Periodic-table-of-the-elements stationery. Design No. 1149493, Japan Patent Office., 2001), which combines thes- andp-blocks into one tube, can recover features of Mendeleev's periodic law. Finally we introduce a topic on the recently proposed nuclear periodic table based on the proton magic numbers (Hagino and Maeno in Found Chem 22:267-273, 2020). Here, the nuclear shell structure leads to a new arrangement of the elements with the proton magic-number nuclei treated like noble-gas atoms. We show that the resulting alignments of the elements in both the atomic and nuclear periodic tables are common over about two thirds of the tables because of a fortuitous coincidence in their magic numbers.",2021,History & Philosophy of Science,1
The Approach of The Court of Justice of the European Union Towards the Protection of Three-Dimensional Marks,Trade Mark; Three-Dimensional Shape; Non-Traditional Mark; Distinctiveness; Nature of Goods; Technical Result; EU Trade Mark Directive; EU Trade Mark Regulation; The Court of Justice of the European Union Case Law; ,"Three-dimensional shapes are the most common type of non-traditional marks becoming widespread. Especially in the last two decades, trade mark applications regarding the protection of three-dimensional shapes have increased significantly. Assessment for the registration of three-dimensional shape marks is no different from other marks types, as the Court of Justice of the European Union suggests. However, in addition to standard trade mark protection requirements, three-dimensional shapes must fulfil additional criteria. The EU Trade Mark Regulation and the EU Trade Mark Directive include special provisions for three-dimensional marks. According to the law, three-dimensional shapes which result from the nature of the goods, are necessary to obtain a technical result, or give substantial value to the goods, are excluded from trade mark protection in the EU. The Court of Justice of the European Union is quite strict in interpreting the abovementioned criteria for three-dimensional shape marks. As an inherent result, obtaining trade mark protection for three-dimensional shapes becomes increasingly difficult for proprietors. The CJEU gives particular importance to the public interest clause and ensures that common shapes keep open for competition in the market since shapes are finite and certain shapes are in common use. The CJEU justifies the conduct by claiming that time-restricted intellectual property rights such as patent or design rights should not be extended through the trade mark route for specific products. The first and second subsections of the exclusion seem to be appropriate. However, the third exclusion is problematic due to its wording and interpretation by the CJEU. Thus, this study suggests that narrowing the scope of the third subsection would fit the purposes of trade mark protection regarding three-dimensional shapes.",2022,Government & Law,1

The infiltration of monocytes and fibroblasts into the injured lungs is implicated in IPF. Enolase-1 (ENO1) is a cytosolic glycolytic enzyme which could translocate onto the cell surface and act as a plasminogen receptor to facilitate cell migration via plasmin activation. Our proprietary ENO1 antibody, HL217, was screened for its specific binding to ENO1 and significant inhibition of cell migration and plasmin activation (patent: US9382331B2).MethodsIn this study, effects of HL217 were evaluated in vivo and in vitro for treating lung fibrosis.ResultsElevated ENO1 expression was found in fibrotic lungs in human and in bleomycin-treated mice. In the mouse model, HL217 reduced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, inflammation, body weight loss, lung weight gain, TGF-beta upregulation in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and collagen deposition in lung. Moreover, HL217 reduced the migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and the recruitment of myeloid cells into the lungs. In vitro, HL217 significantly reduced cell-associated plasmin activation and cytokines secretion from primary human PBMC and endothelial cells. In primary human lung fibroblasts, HL217 also reduced cell migration and collagen secretion.ConclusionsThese findings suggest multi-faceted roles of cell surface ENO1 and a potential therapeutic approach for pulmonary fibrosis.",2023,Respiratory System,1
Patent highlights June-July 2020,cardiomegaly; neoplasms; peripheral neuropathies; semicarbazones; thiosemicarbazones; CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM; DISEASE; USP9X,"Nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD) can be synthesized via de novo production from tryptophan, but mammalian cells mainly rely on salvage pathways that recycle the nicotinamide generated by NAD-consuming enzymes. Nmnat, a stress response enzyme which exists in three differentially localized isoforms [1], produces NAD from nicotinamide mononucleotide and acts in all three salvage pathways and the de novo pathway. Nmnat enzymes are essential neuronal maintenance factors, probably by an additional chaperone activity [2]. Overexpression of Nmnat2 (the isoform in the Golgi apparatus) also seems to protect against cardiac hypertrophy [3] and colon cancer [4]. The inventors' novel semicarbazones and thiosemicarbazones are supposed to be the first reported nongenetic activators of Nmnat2. About 50,000 synthetic organic chemicals were tested in a doubly coupled high-throughput assay that contained two enzymes, Nmnat2 and alcohol dehydrogenase (to convert NAD into the fluorescent indicator product). Compounds exhibiting activating properties were retested in an alcohol dehydrogenase assay that used NAD as a substrate; those that were inactive in this secondary assay might represent direct activators of Nmnat2. The preferred compound is (E)-N'-(1- (pyridin-2-yl) ethylidene) azetidine-1-carbothiohydrazide; in the murine chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy paradigm it significantly increased the paw pressure threshold at a dose of 10 or 3 (but not 1) mg/kg/day i.p.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Factors influencing the prioritisation of access to medicines in trade-related intellectual property policymaking in Thailand,compulsory licensing; flexibilities; patent; TRIPS; TRIPS-plus; ,"Thailand is facing ongoing trade-related challenges that threaten access to an affordable and sustainable supply of medicines. Despite Thailand's history of balancing trade pressures and public health priorities, little is known about the factors that enable or constrain a focus on access to medicines in trade-related intellectual property (IP) decision making. Using document analysis and qualitative interviews, and drawing on Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework, this qualitative study examines the factors that have enabled or constrained Thailand from focusing on access to medicines in three case studies of trade-related IP policy: Thailand's patent law and its amendments; its issuance of compulsory licences; and its decision-making about TRIPS-plus trade agreements including potential membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The degree to which access to medicines has been prioritised in Thailand's trade-related IP policymaking has varied across different types of policymaking and over time. Integral to its successes has been the involvement of the Ministry of Health and sustained advocacy by access to medicines coalitions which exert political pressure, generate evidence, and provide technical assistance to support evidence-based policy reform. In addition, Thailand's compulsory licencing was made possible by a policy entrepreneur with the motivation and authority to implement policy change. Constraints to Thailand's focus on access to medicines have included its trade dependence on the United States (US), ongoing US trade pressure to implement TRIPS-plus measures, and intense lobbying from Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the organisation representing US-based major pharmaceutical companies, to increase IP protection for pharmaceuticals in Thailand. Through the use of Kingdon's framework, this study's focus on three different types of trade-related IP policymaking has provided a detailed picture of the factors that have influenced the prioritisation of access to medicines and how these have played out in Thailand. Thailand's mixed history with regard to the prioritisation of access to medicines could provide lessons for other low- and middle-income countries facing similar challenges to access to medicines by ensuring that the conditions are right in each of the three streams for windows of opportunity to emerge.",2024,Government & Law,1
Research on the heterogeneity of technical innovation in the Chinese e-cigarette industry - rethinking the A-U model,e-Cigarette; Product innovation; Process innovation; A-U Model; Inverse A-U model; ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION,"PurposeUnlike traditional industries, the e-cigarette is an epoch-making innovative product originating in China and occupying an absolute competitive advantage in the international market. The traditional A-U model describes the laws and characteristics of technological innovation in developed countries. In contrast, the inverse A-U model depicts the process of secondary innovation in late-developing countries through digestion and absorption. This paper aims to find out that if the e-cigarette, as a first innovation industry in a late-developing country, conform to the A-U model or conform to the inverse A-U model. Design/methodology/approachThis paper takes the patent data of e-cigarettes from 2004 to 2021 as the research object, and uses Python's Jieba segment words to divide product innovation and process innovation, and then uses statistical analysis methods to conduct empirical analyses on these data. FindingsThus, an improved A-U model suitable for the e-cigarette industry is proposed. In this model, product innovation in the e-cigarette industry appeared earlier than process innovation, but the synchronous development of product and process innovation is not lagging. The improved A-U model in the e-cigarette industry is not only different from the traditional A-U model but also does not conform to the inverse A-U model. Research limitations/implicationsIt is conducive to expanding and clarifying the theoretical contribution and applicable boundaries of the A-U model and has sparked thinking and exploration of the A-U model in e-cigarettes and emerging industries. Practical implicationsOn this basis, suggestions on the development path and countermeasures of the e-cigarette industry are put forward. Originality/valueBased on the e-cigarette industry, this paper takes patents as the research object and provides the method of dividing product innovation and process innovation, and proposes an A-U model suitable for the e-cigarette industry on this basis. By comparing the traditional A-U model with the inverse A-U model in latecomer countries, the background and causes of e-cigarette A-U model heterogeneity are analyzed from different stages and overall morphology. Based on this, the heterogeneity characteristics of e-cigarette innovation are summarized and sorted out.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Electric Drive Solution for Low-Floor City Transport Trams,tram; low floor; independently rotating wheels; drive solution; FIELD-ORIENTED CONTROL; DC DRIVE; SIMULATION; VEHICLES; SAFETY; MODEL,"The urban transport system based on trams as the basic means of transport is one of the oldest systems of human transport in urban agglomerations. A tram is a more efficient, cheaper-to-operate, and greener means of transport compared to a bus. Striving to enable the use of this means of transport by elderly and disabled people, constructors and manufacturers of tram vehicles began to consider the requirements of the ordering parties-organizers of municipal public transport-in their solutions. The basic condition for disabled and elderly people to use tram transport is the possibility of safe and efficient entry and exit from the vehicle at tram stops. The fulfillment of this condition is possible only in the case of tram vehicles with a low 100% floor, and this, in turn, requires the replacement of trolleys with traditional wheelsets, that is, trolleys with independently rotating wheels, in the construction of the running gear. A wheelset with independently rotating wheels (IRW) does not have self-centering properties, and, thus, problems may arise with excessive wear of wheel and rail profiles and with continuous contact of the wheel flange with the rail, which may, consequently, lead to derailment. Driving a vehicle on the track in this case is governed by different laws. To prevent such phenomena, it is required to use the wheel drive control system, which allows for the stabilization of the vehicle movement on the track. Both the introduction of independently rotating wheels in the construction of the bogie and the drive connected to the wheel control system requires research and analysis to confirm the correctness of the assumptions made. The innovative solution of the control system in the case of a tram vehicle was patented and then the patent was implemented to produce a low-floor tram with 100% low floor by a Polish tram manufacturer. This article presents the results of the work carried out on the adoption of the concept of a running gear and drive solution for a low-floor tram vehicle with independently rotating wheels and the results of simulation analysis of the drive control of such a system, using mathematical models of the mechanical system (running gear) and the electrical system (motor drive control system).",2022,Energy & Fuels,1
Private sector availability and affordability of under 5 malaria health commodities in selected states in Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory,Access to medicines; availability; affordability; antimalarial commodities; pharmaceutical policy; MEDICINES; PRICE,"BackgroundTo guarantee uninterrupted service delivery, quality-assured products must be affordable and continuously available across all sectors, including the private sector, which provides more than 60% of healthcare services in Nigeria. We investigated the private sector availability and affordability of under 5 malaria commodities to establish the level of access in this sector.MethodsWe surveyed patent medicine and pharmacy stores across seven states in Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory to establish the availability and affordability of selected malaria commodities for children under 5 years. Availability was measured as the percentage of visited outlets with the product of interest on the day of visit, while affordability was assessed by establishing if it cost more than a day's wage for the least-paid government worker to purchase a full course of malaria diagnostic test and/or medication.ResultsArtemisinin-based antimalarials for uncomplicated and severe malaria were the most available commodities. SPAQ1 and SPAQ2 used for seasonal malaria chemoprevention campaign were surprisingly also available in some outlets. However, only about half (48.3% and 53.3%) of the surveyed outlets had stock of artemether/lumefantrine (AL1) and artesunate injection, respectively. The median price of surveyed products ranged from USD (United States Dollars) 0.38 to USD 2.17 per treatment/test. Except for amodiaquine tablet and artemether injection, which cost less, all other originator brands cost the same or more than the lowest-priced generic. Antimalarial products were affordable as their median prices were not more than a day's wage for the least-paid government worker. However, when the cost of testing and treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) was assessed, testing and treatment with dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine were unaffordable as the they cost more than 1.5 times the daily wage of the least-paid government worker.ConclusionThe overall private sector availability of under-five malaria commodities in surveyed locations was suboptimal. Also, testing and treatment with recommended ACTs were not affordable for all surveyed products. These findings suggest the need for interventions to improve access to affordable under-five malaria commodities.",2024,Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Optimizing Treatment of Schizophrenia: Clinical and Economical Potential for Patient Switching to Long-Acting Injectables,Budget impact analysis; Network Meta-Analysis; Semi-annual formulation; Paliperidone palmitate; Adherence; ORAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; METAANALYSIS; ADHERENCE,"INTRODUCTION: Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs), due to a lower frequency of administration, could address the well-established challenge of non-adherence to oral ones. We conducted a Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) to assess the relationship between administration frequency and effectiveness. The recent introduction of a semi-annual paliperidone palmitate formulation, along with the arrival of monthly paliperidone generics, could emphasize LAI's advantages. Aim of this paper is to present the results derived from an updated version of our previous NMA. These results are used to fuel a budget impact model built to evaluate the economic implications of optimizing dosing intervals. METHODS: We compare the current distribution of patients among available LAI active substances and dosing frequencies with an optimized scenario. In this scenario, 20% of patients are switched to the next permitted regimen with a longer inter-dosing interval. Drug acquisition costs and relapse management costs are taken into account over a one-year simulation period; these last items are estimated by means of the event rates obtained from the updated meta-analysis. The optimized scenario incorporates the reduced cost resulting from the expiration of patents. RESULTS: Throughout the analysis, a total of 11,600 patients were able to switch from shorter to longer dosing intervals, leading to an overall optimization of quality of care. The greater expenditure incurred by the Italian National Health Service (NHS) in the acquisition of newer and longer-lasting drugs is offset by savings associated with the arrival of generics of monthly paliperidone palmitate and the shift toward less-relapsing regimens. The net impact on the NHS budget is a saving of more than 19 million Euros. CONCLUSION: This economic saving has the potential to initiate a virtuous process: it could be reinvested to fund a further shift from oral daily therapies, which are less expensive but marked by poor compliance, to LAIs. According to our simulation, nearly 40 thousand patients could undergo this transition, without additional expenses for the NHS.",2024,Health Care Sciences & Services,1

Innovation has generated changes in the nature of competition as firms introduce new transaction techniques, product designs, and production processes. Innovation competition is driving the 'Business Revolution' in retail, wholesale, manufacturing, services, and financial technology. Transaction innovation in online platforms and multi-sided markets has raised antitrust concerns about anticompetitive conduct, vertical restraints, consumer privacy, and barriers to entrepreneurship. The article argues that although antitrust policy makers recognize the importance of innovation competition, they need to update their economic frameworks. Antitrust policy makers need to move beyond traditional analysis based on the twin frameworks of perfect competition and imperfect competition. The article provides an introduction to the emerging Economics of Technology & Innovation and examines some implications for antitrust policy. First, antitrust policy should shift its focus from price competition without technological change to address non-price aspects of innovation competition. Secondly, antitrust policy should apply economic analysis that recognizes the critical role of Intellectual Property and technology standards in innovation competition. Thirdly, antitrust policy toward horizontal and vertical mergers should consider developments in the economic analysis of innovation competition.",2023,Government & Law,1
Integrated Metabolomics and Network Pharmacology Analysis Immunomodulatory Mechanisms of Qifenggubiao Granules,Qifenggubiao granules; metabonomics; network pharmacology; cyclophosphamide; immunosuppression; POTENTIAL TRP CHANNELS; COUGH,"Background: Qifenggubiao granules (QFGBG) is a new Chinese medicine independently developed by Heilongjiang Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which combines the essence of Yupingfeng powder and Shengmai yin (invention patent number: CN1325098C, approval number: Sinopharm Zhunzi B20020410), and has been included in the 2020 edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia. It has remarkable pharmacodynamic results and conclusive clinical effects in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, chronic cough and other diseases. Previous pharmacological studies have shown that it has immunomodulatory effect, but its immunomodulatory mechanism is still unclear.Methods: In this study, cyclophosphamide (CTX) was used to establish the immune hypofunction model in mice, and the weight change, index of immune organs in spleen and thymus, pathological sections of immune organs and inflammatory factors were used to evaluate the model. Based on the metabolic biomarkers obtained by metabonomics technology, the potential targets of Qifeng Gubiao Granule immunomodulation were obtained by integrating the targets of blood components, metabolites and diseases through network pharmacology. Meanwhile, GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were carried out on the potential targets.Results: QFGBG can increase body weight and organ index, and recover immune organ damage caused by CP. Metabonomics identified 13 metabolites with significant changes, among which the level of phospholipid (PC) metabolites decreased significantly in the model group. Sphingosine -1- phosphate, 1- palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine [LysoPC (16:0/0:0)] and other metabolites were significantly increased in the model group, and 98 targets of Qifeng's external immune regulation were obtained by intersecting 629 component targets, 202 metabolite targets and 1916 disease targets. KEGG pathway analysis obtained 233 related metabolic pathways, and the top 20 metabolic pathways mainly involved IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Sphingolipid signaling pathway, and so on.Conclusion: QFGBG may act on AKT1, IL6, MAPK3, PTGS2, CASP3, MAPK1, ESR1, PPARG, HSP90AA1, PPARA and other targets, acting through Sphingolipid signaling pathway and signaling pathway. Combined with pharmacodynamic evaluation, the immunomodulatory effect of QFGBG was confirmed, and the immunomodulatory mechanism of QFGBG with multiple targets and multiple pathways was preliminarily clarified.",2022,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

This study aims to identify genetic causes in patients with syndromic short stature of unknown cause and evaluate the efficacy of the growth hormone response. Methods Trio-whole-exome sequencing was applied to identify pathogenic gene mutations in seven patents with short stature, multiple malformations, and/or intellectual disability. Whole-genome low-coverage sequencing was also performed to identify copy number variants in three patients with concurrent intellectual disability. Recombinant human growth hormone was administered to improve height in patients with an identified cause of syndromic short stature. Results Of the seven patients, three pathogenic/likely pathogenic gene mutations, including one FGFR3 mutation (c.1620C>A p.N540K), one novel GNAS mutation (c.2288C>T p.A763V), and one novel TRPS1 mutation (c.2527_c.2528dupTA p.S843fsX72), were identified in three patients. No copy number variants were identified in the three patients with concurrent intellectual disability. The proband with an FGFR3 mutation, a female 4 and 3/12 years of age, was diagnosed with hypochondroplasia. Long-acting growth hormone improved her height from 85.8 cm [- 5.05 standard deviation (SD)] to 100.4 cm (- 4.02 SD), and her increased height SD score (SDS) was 1.03 after 25 months of treatment. The proband with a GNAS mutation, a female 12 and 9/12 years of age, was diagnosed with pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia. After 14 months of treatment with short-acting growth hormone, her height improved from 139.3 cm (- 2.69 SD) to 145.0 cm (- 2.36 SD), and her increased height SDS was 0.33. Conclusions Trio-whole-exome sequencing was an important approach to confirm genetic disorders in patients with syndromic short stature of unknown etiology. Short-term growth hormone was effective in improving height in patients with hypochondroplasia and pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia.",2021,Genetics & Heredity,1
Determination of Undercutting Avoidance for Designing the Production Technology of Worm Gear Drives with a Curved Profile,worm gear drive; machining; undercutting; mathematical conditions; SIMULATION,"One of the most difficult production geometry tasks arising in the machining process of the elements of a drive pair is to avoid undercuts. It is a serious technological challenge to determine the production of the elements of worm gear drives avoiding the phenomenon undercut, especially in the case of a pair consisting of a curved profile worm and its mating wheel. The technology of forming the tooth surface requires a separate examination in each case, running the simulation procedure of the tool geometry and the movement conditions when forming different teeth. This article proposes a new concept for determining and then avoiding the positions of undercutting by examining the patented worm with a circular arc profile in axial section, due to its extremely advantageous aspect in terms of production technology. The cutting edge of the hob, formed from the substitutional worm, moves on the tooth surface of the worm, and produces the tooth surface of the conjugate wheel. The gear tooth surface has been determined based on the main law of gearing with the lines consisting of the contact points of the conjugated surfaces. The conditions for the disappearance of the common normal or the relative velocity fitting to the common tangent plane of the contacting points are defined in this paper.",2023,Engineering,1
"The discipline of form: why the premise of institutional form does not apply to Chinese capital, technology, land and labor",Credibility thesis; property rights and institutions; development theory; endogeneity; institutional form and function; ,"China is an intellectually overwhelming paradox within development thinking. On the one hand, it is regarded as an economic powerhouse pushing forward decades of sustained growth, which even during major global crises, such as the Corona-epidemic and the 2008 Financial Crisis, bounced back with significant resilience. On the other hand, it appears burdened with all of the 'wrong' institutions: informal, insecure, and autocratic. This collection of papers posits that the paradox is no contradiction when understood through an alternative, theoretical lens: the function of institutions precedes form when trying to understand institutional performance. Thus, whether institutions are formal or informal, public or private, democratic or autocratic, is of secondary importance to the manner in which they function over time and space. To examine this hypothesis, known as the 'credibility thesis', the collection examines China's institutions that govern: 1) capital; 2) technology; 3) land, and; 4) labor; in effect, state-owned banks, collective firms, corporate law and securities, patents and intellectual property rights, environmental bans, and the civil registration or hukou system. In so doing, it not only falsifies the widely prevalent assumption that institutional form determines performance, but concurrently, validates the applicability of the credibility thesis over widely varying sectors and assets.",2021,Government & Law; Public Administration,1

In addition, feral dogs preys on the native fauna, especially the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), a species protected by law. Except for some data on the aforementioned impact, very little is known about feral dogs features in this region, such as distribution, abundance, diet, reproduction, health status, among others. Therefore, a descriptive observational study was carried out in the period 2018-2021 in Tierra del Fuego, with the aim to recognize the endoparasitic fauna of these dogs, with emphasis on Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.). Feces samples were collected from 83 feral dogs captured in 15 farms, which were evaluated using flotation and sedimentation coproparasitological techniques, and optical microscope observation. These qualitative methods showed that 66.3% of the samples were positive. Nine parasitic forms were found, including eggs of taenids, Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina, and Sarcocystis spp. oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts. Samples with more than one parasitic form were also observed, among which the Taenia/Sarcocystis spp. association was the most frequent. For the diagnosis of canine echinococcosis, the detection of Echinococcus spp. antigens by Copro-ELISA and the molecular confirmation by Copro-PCR were performed. The Copro-ELISA test was positive in 10/80 (12.5%) of the samples processed, while 11 samples (13.8%) were positive by Copro-PCR. Their distribution showed that 9 (81.8%) corresponded to farms with sheep farming, and 2 (18.2%) with cattle farming. The presence of E. granulosus s.l. in feral dogs from Tierra del Fuego is the most relevant finding in this study. These results confirm that feral dogs have access to viscera infected with hydatid cysts. However, the intermediate hosts involved (sheep, cattle or guanacos) should be investigated. Its impact on the transmission of cystic echinococcosis in this region should be evaluated, as well as the adequacy of the disease prevention and control actions implemented in Tierra del Fuego should be considered. Finally, the existence of a wild cycle of the disease should be evaluated, in which feral dogs would act as a source of infection for other animals and humans.",2023,Parasitology; Veterinary Sciences,1

Exploring the effect of economic growth pressure (EGP) on green technology innovation (GTI) is important for coordinated economic growth and green transformation. Using the data from 285 cities in China during 2006-2018, this study investigates the influence of EGP on GTI by taking the difference between economic growth target and previous year's actual growth rate to represent the EGP. The results indicate that EGP negatively affects GTI. When there is a 1% increase in EGP, green patent applications will fall by 3.2%. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis indicates that the negative effect of EGP is especially significant in western China compared with eastern and central regions. In addition, we find various nonlinear moderating effects between EGP and GTI by using panel threshold model. Specifically, EGP and GTI show an inverted U-shaped relationship with EGP increasing. Meanwhile, only when environmental regulation, government support, and financial development cross the thresholds will EGP have a significant role in promoting GTI. This study provides helpful implications for decision-makers to adopt a more reasonable combination of policy tools to achieve economic growth targets and low-carbon transformation.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
R&D investment and regional innovation performance - threshold effects based on intellectual property protection,Regional innovation performance; intellectual property protection intensity; R&D investment; human resource investment; Panel threshold model; DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY; LEVEL; STRATEGIES; PATENTS; RIGHTS; LAW,"Based on the panel data of 24 provinces and cities in China from 2009 to 2017, this paper uses panel threshold regression model with regional intellectual property protection intensity as the threshold variable to investigate the effect of R&D investment on regional innovation performance from two perspectives of human resource investment and R&D funding investment with different threshold effects. The results show that human resource investment and R&D investment have a significant contribution to regional innovation performance with a lag of three periods, and there is a significant double threshold effect. The optimal intellectual property protection intensity range of human resource input on regional innovation performance promotion is (0.8698, 0.8712). The optimal intellectual property protection intensity range for R&D investment on regional innovation performance is (0.8698, 0.8781), and R&D investment on regional innovation performance shows an increasing and then decreasing effect. This paper constructs a system of indicators to measure the intensity of intellectual property protection in China based on the dual-track parallelism of intellectual property protection management in China. It also measures the intensity of intellectual property protection in each region of China. A non-linear relationship between R&D investment, intellectual property protection and regional innovation is found.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Cumyl-CBMICA: A new synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist containing a cyclobutyl methyl side chain,generic laws; NPS; NpSG; structure elucidation; IN-VITRO; METABOLISM; VIVO,"Since the beginning of the phenomenon of new psychoactive substances (NPS), synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) have been the largest and most prevalent subclass of these drugs in Europe. Many countries implemented specific legislation scheduling classes of substances defined on the basis of their chemical structure to reduce supply. We describe the identification and analytical characterization within the EU project ADEBAR plus of 1-(cyclobutylmethyl)-N-(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamide which resulted in the formal notification through the Early Warning System of the European Monitoring Centre for Drug and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). This is the first identification of this new SCRA worldwide and the analytical data was distributed (inter-)nationally right after identification in 2019. First, the substance was isolated from the herbal material using preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Structure elucidation and analytical characterization were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-solid state infrared spectroscopy (GC-sIR), liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-qToF-MS), Raman spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The new compound contains a cyclobutyl methyl group as a side chain and has not been described in any patent to our knowledge.

Economic and social development generated by innovative startups: does heterogeneity persist across Italian macro-regions?,Regional development; capital turnover; employees; innovative startups; Italian macro-regions; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; SMALL FIRMS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; JOB CREATION; POLICY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; KNOWLEDGE; GROWTH; SMES; TECHNOLOGY,"The aim of the present paper is to investigate if heterogeneity - meant in terms of economic and social development generated by innovative startups - persists or not across the three Italian macro-regions (north, centre, and south of Italy). According to law number (L. n.) 221/2012, Italian innovative startups are characterized by three parameters: (A) investments in R&D activities; (B) hiring experienced researchers; (C) holding a patent. By testing the effect that these parameters can exert in terms of economic and social development, heterogeneity or homogeneity between northern, central, and southern Italian macro-regions is disclosed. Methodologically, statistical elaborations leverage an unbalanced panel of 11,052 Italian innovative startups (data are retrieved from the official website of Italian Chambers of Commerce at) and are carried out through the estimation of a Stochastic Frontier Analysis - SFA without a time variable stochastic efficiency term. Achieved results disclose that heterogeneity persists across Italian macro-regions in reference to factors generating an economic and social impact; however, homogeneity exists in reference to causes of gaps from the efficiency frontier. In particular, results about northern macro-region reveal specific dynamics that - if properly managed - can increase the economic and social impact of innovative startups.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Trademarks and firm market value: Evidence from new trademark-firm linked data in China,Trademark; Frims market value; First-to-file; Intellectual property right(IPR); China; Energing economy; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; INNOVATION; LAW; PRODUCT; ISOMORPHISM; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; PROTECTION; ECONOMICS; STRATEGY,"A growing stream of research conducted in developed economies has shown that trademarks are positively related to firms' market value. However, we have limited understanding of whether this finding might apply to emerging economies, many of which have developed their own unique trademark regimes and are currently experiencing exponential growth in trademark registrations. In this study, we address this gap by constructing a new dataset that links trademark registrations with listed firms in China-the first of its kind for Chinese trademarks. Using this dataset, we find that in-use trademarks (trademarks being used by firms), as well as unused trademarks registered for a firm's current businesses, are positively related to firm value; further, the strength of IPR protection in subnational regions (provinces in China) amplifies these relationships. By contrast, unused trademarks that are not registered for a firm's current businesses have no impact on firm value. We also find that trademarks and patents complement each other in enhancing firm value. We call for more future research attention to trademarks in emerging economies to improve existing understanding of the important role trademarks play in these fast-growing markets often featuring unique IPR regimes.",2024,Business & Economics,1

Thus, at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, we designed and patented an affordable and accessible device that mimics Valsalva called Forced Inspiratory Suction and Swallow Tool (FISST).Areas CoveredIn this review, we discuss the premise for the design of FISST, based on applications of the law of conservation energy, the continuity equation, and Bernoulli's principle. We then detail the mechanism by which FISST stimulates hiccup cessation by increasing negative inspiratory pressure when drinking through the apparatus, causing diaphragmatic contraction and disruption of the hiccup reflex. We then detail the efficacy and future applications of FISST in addressing other pathologies.Expert OpinionFISST has been used to address hiccups by utilizing its reverse-Valsalva effect to increase parasympathetic stimulation by increasing vagal tone. In a prospective study that we conducted on a cohort of 249 hiccup subjects worldwide, this tool achieved 92% effectiveness. Additionally, several cases, including a published case report, have found FISST successful in terminating supraventricular tachycardias (SVT). FISST may be further utilized in diagnosing or addressing various upper airway pathologies and should be explored further.",2023,Engineering,1
FAKE TRADEMARK SPECIMENS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS,; ,"United States trademark law requires that a mark be used in commerce for it to qualify for registration at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Applicants prove that they have met the use requirement by submitting to the PTO photographic specimens of their use of the mark in commerce. This Piece reports the results of new empirical work showing that an appreciable number of U.S. trademark applications originating in China include fraudulent specimens of use. In particular, with respect to use-based applications originating in China that were filed at the PTO in 2017 solely for apparel goods, we estimate that 66.9% of such applications included fraudulent specimens. Yet 59.8% of these fraudulent applications proceeded to publication, and 38.9% then proceeded to registration. If these applications are representative of the overall population of Chinese-origin applications in that year, then approximately 14.0% of all such use-based applications filed with the PTO in 2017 were fraudulent. Fraudulent registrations worsen the problems of trademark depletion and clutter, undermine the integrity of the trademark register, and hurt legitimate businesses that may benefit from using these marks. We therefore recommend legislative action to make it easier for third parties and the PTO to cull these marks from the register and systematic improvement by the PTO to ensure that applications with fraudulent specimens are not registered in the first instance.",2020,Government & Law,1
End co-formulant secrecy,Pesticides; Co-formulants; Policy; Co-formulant secrecy; Ecotoxicology; ,"Pesticides, widely used in modern agriculture, are applied in formulations that contain the main ingredient (active ingredient) and additional chemicals like solvents and surfactants (co-formulants). Both active ingredients and co-formulants can cause human and environmental toxicity. However, under European Union and United States law, the full details of the co-formulant composition are kept secret from the public and researchers. Only the producer and regulators know the full details. Here I argue that legislators should end 'coformulant secrecy' and require all the ingredients in a pesticide be listed openly, including their concentrations. To this end I draw parallels between the legislation for pesticides with that of medicines, review the counterarguments, and discuss the impacts on research and regulation. Co-formulants can be toxicologically relevant, and some are even more toxic than the active ingredient in the formulation. Pesticide users, consumers and scientists deserve to have transparency in understanding what co-formulants are included in pesticide formulations. The stated rationale for secrecy is to protect innovation and reward companies for undertaking expensive research and development. However, secrecy is ineffective at protecting innovation, as it is possible to reverse engineer a formulation's composition. Further, patents are already utilised, so secrecy adds no additional benefit to industry. I argue that co-formulant secrecy only serves to stifte and limit the ability of independent scientists to conduct research.",2024,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

However, the poor pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics of conventional oral tablets and poor medication compliance limit the optimal efficacy of rasagiline. Based on this, we designed and optimized a sustained-release rasagiline in situ gel based on in vitro release and in vivo PK results. Among them, we found for the first time that aluminum hydroxide can effectively shorten the lag phase and promote early and late release, making the daily release more uniform. After subcutaneous administration of the optimized gel formulation at a monthly dose, the C-max (64 ng/ml) was lower than that of free rasagiline (494 ng/ml) administered subcutaneously at a daily dose and comparable to that of oral administration of Azilect((R)) (59.1 ng/ml) at a daily dose. In the meantime, the plasma concentration of rasagiline was mainly maintained at 5-10 ng/ml for about 1 month, and the active metabolite 1-aminoindane in plasma was also able to maintain a steady state. The rasagiline in situ gel has suitable viscosity and injectability, good repeatability of subcutaneous injection, and controllable impurities and can achieve sustained release in vivo with small burst release, which may have the clinical application advantages of maximizing the disease-modifying effect of rasagiline and improving medication compliance.",2023,Instruments & Instrumentation; Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

New orally active antischistosomals featuring novel molecular scaffolds are urgently needed to prevent the emergence of resistance. Methods We screened 400 drug-like compounds contained in the open-access Pandemic Response Box (PRB) against newly transformed schistosomula (NTS) at a concentration of 10 mu M scoring death, changes in motility, and morphological alterations. Compounds displaying an activity >= 66% at 72 h underwent testing against adult Schistosoma mansoni in vitro. Fast-acting (>= 66% at 24 h), nontoxic drugs focusing on late-stage and approved drugs were investigated in the patent S. mansoni mouse model. Results We identified 26 hits active against NTS, of which 17 elicited >= 66% activity against adult S. mansoni following 24 h of drug exposure. The highest activity against adult S. mansoni was observed with MMV1581558 (EC50 value of 0.18 +/- 0.01 mu M) and nitazoxanide (0.47 +/- 0.07 mu M). Of the five compounds tested in vivo, MMV1581558 and the approved drug ozanimod reduced average worm burden versus controls by 42 % and 36 %, respectively, after a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg bodyweight in mice harboring a chronic S. mansoni infection. Conclusion MMV1581558 discovered from screening the PRB represents a novel antischistosomal scaffold with high in vitro antischistosomal activity amenable to chemical modification for drug development.",2022,Infectious Diseases; Microbiology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

Therefore, there is a necessity to analyze the individual efforts and conditions of the 27 member states that might determine their final innovative performance. The results of a scientific literature review showed that there is a growing interest in the usage of artificial intelligence when seeking to improve decision-making processes. Data envelopment analysis, as a branch of computational intelligence methods, has proved to be a reliable tool for innovation efficiency evaluation. Therefore, this paper aimed to apply DEA for the assessment of the European Union's innovation efficiency from 2000 to 2020, when innovation was measured by patent, trademark, and design applications. The findings showed that the general EU innovation efficiency situation has improved over time, meaning that each programming period was more successful than the previous one. On the other hand, visible disparities were found across the member states, showing that Luxembourg is an absolute innovation efficiency leader, while Greece and Portugal achieved the lowest average efficiency scores. Both the application of the DEA method and the gathered results may act as viable guidelines on how to improve R & I policies and select future investment directions.",2023,Business & Economics,1

Therefore, new drug-delivery approaches, based on nanomedicine strategies, are needed to enhance its therapeutic potential in favor of a dose-reduction of cisplatin. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolism-derived intermediates, as well as lipid peroxidation end-products, are used as adjuvants to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Lipid hydroperoxides, derived from the oxidation of edible oils, can contribute to cell death, generating breakdown products (e.g., reactive aldehydes). In this regard, the aim of this present study was to evaluate an invitro combinatory strategy between a lecithin-based nanoemulsion system of K600, a patented mixture of peroxidated oil and peroxidated cholesterol, and cisplatin on DLD1 human adenocarcinoma cells. Our findings showed that nanoemulsions, acting in synergy with cisplatin, improve cisplatin bioactivity, in terms of enhancing its anti-cancer activity, towards DLD1 cells. Indeed, this combination approach, whilst maintaining cisplatin at low concentrations, induces a significant reduction in DLD1 cell viability, an increase in pro-apoptotic markers, and genotoxic damage. Therefore, K600 nanoemulsions as an efficient targeted delivery system of cisplatin allow for the reduction in the chemotherapeutic agent doses.",2021,Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,1
Exploring the Molecular Mechanism of Qing Guang An Granule in Treating Glaucoma Using Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking,; ,"Background. Qing Guang An Granule (QGAG), a Chinese patent medicine, has been used clinically to treat glaucoma for more than 20 years. Objective. To explore the possible mechanism of treatment of QGAG in glaucoma by using network pharmacology and molecular docking in this study. Methods. Active compounds and targets of each herb in QGAG were retrieved via the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Glaucoma-related targets were acquired from OMIM and DisGeNET database. Key targets of QGAG against glaucoma were acquired by overlapping the above targets via the Venn diagram. Using the DAVID, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the key targets were performed.

DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF FIRST ORDER DERIVATIVE SPECTROSCOPIC METHOD FOR SIMULTANEOUS ESTIMATION OF MANGIFERIN AND BERBERIN HCL IN BULK AND SYNTHETIC MIXTURE,Mangiferin; Berberin HCl; Simultaneous equation method; ICH guidelines; Quality control; ,"Introduction: There are so many promising plant-based chemical constituents are present which act as an alternative therapy for the control of diabetes. But due to the lack of its proper quality control parameters, they are not widely used. The USFDA patent is approved for a fixed dosage combination of Mangiferin (MF) and Berberin HCl (BER) as antidiabetic herbal formulation. Objective: The literature review suggested that no UV spectroscopic method been reported in the literature review for the combination formulation of MF and BER. Methodology: The method is based on a simultaneous method using two wavelengths, 257 nm (lambda(max) of MF) and 265 nm (lambda(max) of BER). Methanol was used as a solvent. Results: The drug response with respect to absorbance was linear over the concentration range 5-30 mu g/ml for MF and 10-60 mu g/ml for BER. The percentage recovery of MF and BER as found to be 100.00% and 99.48%, respectively. The % R. S. D. values for intra-day, and the inter-day precision study was less than 2.0%, confirming that the method was sufficiently precise. Conclusion: The method can be successfully employed for the simultaneous determination of MF and BER in pharmaceutical formulations. The developed method is validated as per ICH guideline Q2 (R1) for global acceptance of standardized herbal formulations.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

The pathophysiology of neuropathic pain is too complex. Therefore, an accurate and reliable prediction of the appropriate hits/ligands for the treatment of neuropathic pain is a challenging process. However, computer-aided drug discovery approaches contributed significantly to discovering newer hits/ligands for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The computational approaches like homology modeling, induced-fit molecular docking, structure-activity relationships, metadynamics, and virtual screening were cited in the literature for the identification of potential hit molecules against neuropathic pain. These hit molecules act as inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, FLAT antagonists, TRPA1 modulators, voltage-gated sodium channel binder, cannabinoid receptor-2 agonists, sigma-1 receptor antagonists, etc. Sigma-1 receptor is a distinct type of opioid receptor and several patents were obtained for sigma-1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of neuropathic pain. These molecules were found to have a profound role in the management of neuropathic pain. The present review describes the validated therapeutic targets, potential chemical scaffolds, and crucial protein-ligand interactions for the management of neuropathic pain based on the recently reported computational methodologies of the present and past decades. The study can help the researcher to discover newer drugs/drug-like molecules against neuropathic pain.",2021,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

Felids can be infected with a wide variety of cardio-pulmonary nematodes and can act as reservoirs of infection for domestic cats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution and species diversity of cardio-pulmonary nematodes in wild felids from Romania. Methods: A total of 54 wild felids (7 Lynx lynx and 47 Fells silvestris) were legally collected from different locations in Romania and analysed by complete parasitological necropsy. The entire respiratory tract was longitudinally opened and checked for the presence of nematodes. Detected nematodes were collected and morphologically identified to species level. Results: Two Eurasian lynxes and 29 European wildcats were positive for cardio-pulmonary nematodes. Eurasian lynxes were infected with two species of cardio-pulmonary nematodes, Eucoleus aerophilus and Troglostrongylus brevior, while in wildcats the dominant parasite was E. aerophilus (34.0%) followed by Angiostrongylus chabaudi (23.4%) and T. brevior (14.9%). Dirofilaria immitis and Aelurostrongylus abstrusus were each detected in two wildcats (4.3%). Conclusions: The present study expanded the epidemiological knowledge on felid cardiopulmonary nematodes in Romania. We confirmed the presence of A. abstrusus in wildcats and a patent infection with T. brevior in Eurasian lynx.",2022,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,1

It is one of the most favorable biodegradable carriers for nanoparticulate drug delivery due to its intrinsic properties, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, availability of free reactive amino groups, and ease of chemical modification into different active derivatives. Furthermore, interesting physical properties (film-forming, gelling and thickening) make it a suitable candidate for formulations, such as films, microcapsules, beads, nanoparticles, nanofibres, nanogel, and so on. Researchers have reported that chitosan nanoparticles act as a promising vehicle for herbal actives as they provide a superior alternative to traditional carriers and improve pharmaceutical efficiency. As no review of chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating herbal extracts and bioactives has been published to date, a maiden effort has been made to collate and review the use of chitosan nanoparticles for the entrapment of phytoconstituents to yield stable, efficient, and safe drug delivery systems. Additionally, the paper presents a comprehensive account of the state-of the-art in fabricating herbal chitosan nanoparticles and their current pharmacological status. A list of patents on chitosan nanoparticles of herbal actives has also been included. This review is intended to serve as a didactic discourse for the formulation scientists endeavoring to develop advanced delivery systems for herbal actives.",2022,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

An increase in project knowledge scope, defined as the number of technical fields an R&D project covers, can be challenging for resource-constrained small firms. These firms often rely primarily on their principal investigators (PIs), who act as heavyweight project managers in guiding project ideas to successful R&D outcomes. PIs also work concurrently on multiple projects, a strategy to promote learning across projects. To better understand how small firms PIs manage projects with high knowledge scope, our research assembles and analyzes a data set of 1374 R&D projects conducted by 933 small firms in the context of U.S. Small Business Administration awards. Results, after accounting for endogeneity, suggest a negative association between project knowledge scope and project success, which we measured using patent forward citation counts. We also find that a PI's multiproject status negatively moderates (i.e., amplifies) this association, while project management experience positively moderates (i.e., weakens) it. A follow-up post hoc analysis suggests that a shared problem domain is a key contingency for the moderation effects of both multiproject status and project management experience. Taken together, our research offers insights on how to effectively manage R&D projects in resource-constrained small firms.",2022,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,1

In these systems, microorganisms are naturally incorporated into the SFDM layer, which acts as a biological and physical filter. The microorganisms present in an innovative and highly efficient aerobic, electrochemically enhanced, encapsulated SFDM bioreactor were studied to elucidate the nature of the dominant microbial communities present in sludge and in encapsulated SFDM, patented as living membrane (R) (LM) of the experimental setup. The results were compared to those obtained from the microbial communities found in similar experimental reactors without an applied electric field. The data gathered from the NGS microbiome profiling showed that the microbial consortia found in the experimental systems are comprised of archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities. However, the distribution of the microbial communities found in e-LMBR and LMBR had significant differences. The results showed that the presence of an intermittently applied electric field in e-LMBR promotes the growth of some types of microorganisms (mainly electroactive microorganisms) responsible for the highly efficient treatment of the wastewater and for the mitigation of the membrane fouling found for those bioreactors.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Buprenorphine poisoning in children: a 10-year-experience of Marseille Poison Center,buprenorphine; children; intoxication; METHADONE,"Buprenorphine is a mu-partial agonist and k-antagonist acting on central opioid receptors. Patented for analgesia in 1968, buprenorphine has been used as opioid substitutive therapy since the 1990s, as well as methadone. The aim was to document pediatric poisoning, to discover the severity, and to evaluate the treatment with naloxone. All pediatric poisonings reported to the poison control center Marseille (France)-from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018-were included. Analysis put value on gender, age, estimated quantity, symptoms and their delay, place of treatment, medical treatment, utilization of antidotes, severity of intoxications, and patients' outcome. Fifty-four infant poisonings with buprenorphine were recorded, doses varied between 1 and 36 mg, and children showed mainly neurological (somnolence, miosis horizontal ellipsis ) and gastroenteric (vomiting) effects. Pulmonary effects were described for four children. According to the poisoning severity score, 8 intoxications were classified as 'no symptoms or signs', 37 as minor poisonings, 3 as moderate, none as severe or fatal and 6 were unknown. Medical care was required for 46 children, and four of them were treated with naloxone. Buprenorphine poisoning can cause neurological, gastroenteric, and respiratory symptoms. Even licking a tablet leads to intoxication because of maximal tablet's absorption while placing it under the tongue. Hospital admission is necessary even at small doses. Naloxone was efficient in the four described cases. Parents have to be aware of the poisoning risk with buprenorphine. Recently, commercialized instantly dissolving formulations could cause more severe intoxications.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

On the other hand, traditional antifouling (AF) marine coatings release persistent and toxic biocides that accumulate in sediments and aquatic organisms. To understand the putative impact on marine ecosystems of recently described and patented AF xanthones (xanthones 1 and 2), able to inhibit mussel settlement without acting as biocides, several in silico environmental fate predictions (bioaccumulation, biodegradation, and soil absorption) were calculated in this work. Subsequently, a degradation assay using treated seawater at different temperatures and light exposures was conducted for a period of 2 months to calculate their half-life (DT50). Xanthone 2 was found to be non-persistent (DT50<60 days) at 50 mu M, contrary to xanthone 1 (DT50>60 days). To evaluate the efficacy of both xanthones as AF agents, they were blended into four polymeric-based coating systems: polyurethane- and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based marine paints, as well as room-temperature-vulcanizing PDMS- and acrylic-based coatings. Despite their low water solubility, xanthones 1 and 2 demonstrated suitable leaching behaviors after 45 days. Overall, the generated xanthone-based coatings were able to decrease the attachment of the Mytilus galloprovincialis larvae after 40 h. This proof-of-concept and environmental impact evaluation will contribute to the search for truly environmental-friendly AF alternatives.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

This study aims to propose a network analysis approach, which is typically found in innovation studies, to illustrate the sociological dimensions of actor network theory. The sector is of interest from a social studies of science perspective due to the collision between traditional knowledge philosophies, which are well accepted in East Asian communities, and scientific regulatory standards, that have raised issues regarding the legitimacy and safety of the products. This study considers the actor network linkages between universities, government and industry which act as indicators of knowledge diffusion and collaboration. Relevant records were captured using a heuristic search string and was used to visualize: (i) the number of researchers (agglomeration denoted by the size of bubbles), (ii) organizational linkages through co-authorship (connectedness indicated by the presence of lines between organizations), and (iii) position of the organization (centrality in relation to other organizations). The case presented in this study takes a snapshot of how an advanced economy such as Taiwan, has developed a productive innovation system for herbal medicine.

Wearing multiple hats-The role of working group chairs' affiliation in standards development,Standards Development Organizations (SDO); Governance; Committee chair selection; Collaborative innovation; Social capital; SETTING ORGANIZATIONS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; INNOVATION; GOVERNANCE; COMMITTEES; CONSORTIA; PATENTS; IMPACT,"Standards Development Organizations (SDO) make critical decisions shaping the direction of technological innovation. SDOs are usually considered to offer a neutral venue for the collaborative efforts of different stakeholders, which often pursue competing particular interests. Nevertheless, individuals acting on behalf of the SDO, such as working group chairs, are themselves often employees of individual SDO stakeholders. Recently, there have been concerns that over-representation of the employees of certain powerful stakeholders in SDO leadership positions may undermine the objectivity of SDO decision making. Nevertheless, to date, there exists no empirical evidence to corroborate these concerns. We find that being affiliated with one of the largest SDO stakeholders significantly increases an individual's likelihood of being appointed to a leadership position at IETF, but not at 3GPP. At the same time, in both SDOs, working groups whose chairs are affiliated with leading stakeholders produce standards that are less cited and less referenced than standards produced by other working groups, in particular those chaired by university affiliates. Our findings suggest that the commercial interests of individuals' employers may facilitate these individuals' ascension to SDO leadership positions, but the potential for conflicts between these commercial interests of chairs' employers and the organizational goals of the SDO may negatively impact the success of the working group's standards.",2023,Business & Economics,1

It is also used as an effective anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-fungal agent. The seed of the plant is especially enriched in several bioactive molecules including polyphenols, saponins, alkaloids, and flavonoids and has demonstrated potential to act as an antidiabetic phytotherapeutic. A novel patented formulation (Fenfuro (R) ) was developed in our laboratory from the fenugreek seeds which contained >45% furostanolic saponins (HPLC). Objective : A placebo-controlled clinical compliance study was designed to assess the effects of complementing Fenfuro (R) on a randomized group of human volunteers on antidiabetic therapy (Metformin and sulphonylurea) in controlling the glycemic index along with simultaneous safety assessment. Study methodology and trial design : In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 42 individuals (21 male and 21 female volunteers) in the treatment group (out of 57 enrolled) and 39 individuals (17 male and 22 female volunteers) in the placebo group (out of 47 enrolled), all on antidiabetic therapy with Metformin/ Metformin with sulphonyl urea within the age group of 18-65 years were administered either 1,000 mg (500 mg x 2) (Fenfuro (R) ) capsules or placebo over a period of 12 consecutive weeks. Fasting and postprandial glucose along with glycated hemoglobin were determined as primary outcomes to assess the antidiabetic potential of the formulation. Moreover, in order to evaluate the safety of the formulation, C-peptide and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels as well as immunohematological parameters were assessed between the treatment and placebo groups at the completion of the study. Results : After 12 weeks of administration, both fasting as well as postprandial serum glucose levels decreased by 38 and 44% respectively in the treatment group. Simultaneously, a significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin by about 34.7% was also noted. The formulation did not have any adverse effect on the study subjects as there was no significant change in C- peptide level and TSH level; liver, kidney, and cardiovascular function was also found to be normal as assessed by serum levels of key immunohematological parameters. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion : This clinical compliance study re-instated and established the safety and efficacy of Fenfuro (R) as an effective phytotherapeutic to treat hyperglycemia.",2024,Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,1
Understanding urban concentration of complex manufacturing activities in China,; INDUSTRIAL AGGLOMERATION; GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION; SCALING LAWS; SIZE; PRODUCTIVITY; POPULATION; INNOVATION; ADVANTAGE; GROWTH; SHAPE,"The increasing prominence of urban scaling laws highlights the importance of a systematic understanding of the variational scaling rates for different economic activities. In this article, we utilize several datasets to provide the first systematic investigation of the urban scaling of manufacturing industries in China. Most existing literature assumes that the divergence in urban scaling can be explained by returns to agglomeration, with a few exceptions instead highlighting the role of knowledge complexity or a mixture of both. Our main purpose in this paper is to explain the inter-sector variation of urban scaling rates. In doing this, we provide a clearer approach to demonstrating the relations between urban scaling, returns to agglomeration, and knowledge complexity. Our findings are twofold. First, after uncovering the scaling rates (denoted as urban concentration) and returns to agglomeration (denoted as urban productivity) for each sub-manufacturing sector, we prove that, rather than being a positive predictor, returns to agglomeration is slightly negatively associated with urban scaling rates. This finding reveals that urban concentration of manufacturing may not simply be a natural consequence driven by the maximization of performance. We also show that this result of the manufacturing system contrasts with what would be found in other pure knowledge systems such as patents. Secondly, we measure the complexity for each sector and demonstrate that the variation of urban concentration can be largely explained by their complexity, consistent with the knowledge complexity perspective. Specifically, complex manufacturing sectors are found to concentrate more in large cities than less complex sectors in China. This result provides support for the view that the growth of complex activities hinges more on diversity than on efficiency. The findings above can greatly reduce the current level of ambiguity associated with urban scaling, returns to agglomeration and complexity, and have important policy implications for urban planners, highlighting the significance of a more balanced and diversified configuration of urban productive activities for the growth of innovation economy.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1

The growing tendency towards using fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) control has been fueled mainly by the fact that these controllers have additional tuning knobs that allow coherent adjustment of the dynamics of control systems. For instance, in certain cases, the capacity for additional frequency response shaping gives rise to the generation of control laws that lead to superior performance of control loops. These fractional-order control laws may allow fulfilling intricate control performance requirements that are otherwise not in the span of conventional integer-order control systems. However, there are underpinning points that are rarely addressed in the literature: (1) What are the particular advantages (in concrete figures) of FOPID controllers versus conventional, integer-order (IO) PID controllers in light of the complexities arising in the implementation of the former? (2) For real-time implementation of FOPID controllers, approximations are used that are indeed equivalent to high-order linear controllers. What, then, is the benefit of using FOPID controllers? Finally, (3) What advantages are to be had from having a near-ideal fractional-order behavior in control practice? In the present paper, we attempt to address these issues by reviewing a large portion of relevant publications in the fast-growing FO control literature, outline the milestones and drawbacks, and present future perspectives for industrialization of fractional-order control. Furthermore, we comment on FOPID controller tuning methods from the perspective of seeking globally optimal tuning parameter sets and how this approach can benefit designers of industrial FOPID control. We also review some CACSD (computer-aided control system design) software toolboxes used for the design and implementation of FOPID controllers. Finally, we draw conclusions and formulate suggestions for future research.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,1
THE IMPORTANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOPARKS IN TURKIYE,Technology development zones; Technopark; University-industry interaction; R&D; Innovation; Triple helix; TECHNOLOGY PARKS; SCIENCE PARKS; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS; VARIABLES; CAPACITY,"The belief that science parks, the first examples of which were encountered in the 1950s, stimulate economic growth led to the spread of different forms in developed countries, especially in the 1970s and 1980s. Science parks, which have been increasing in number around the world since the 1990s and are expressed in different ways such as technopark, technopol, technology park, technology development zone, innovation park, are very important tools in ensuring cooperation between university-industry-state in the process of transforming innovative information and technologies into innovation. In addition to providing support to newly established companies in commercialization, infrastructure service, meeting with target customers and the market, obtaining patents, it also offers additional incentives and supports beyond the governmental supports. In addition, they have critical importance for the regional and national development of the regions and countries in which they operate. They help revitalize the industry in which they operate; contribute to the solution of social problems such as employment and brain drain. Science parks first emerged in Turkiye in the 2000s as Technology Development Zones, or commonly as technoparks. Law No. 4691 on Technology Development Zones enacted in 2001 constitutes the legal basis for technoparks. Within the scope of this law, incentive mechanisms are created for technology-based companies and innovative entrepreneurs by providing various supports and exemptions, primarily tax exemptions and infrastructure supports, to the management companies operating in technoparks. Technoparks, which support the creation of an effective entrepreneurship ecosystem and make significant contributions to Turkiye's science and technology policies, are also very important sources of employment for Turkiye. As of February 2022, more than 7,500 companies operate in technoparks all over Turkiye and more than 78,000 personnel are employed in those firms. Technoparks, which strengthen the connections between university, industry and the public with their triple helix understanding, contribute significantly to the execution of science and technology policies within the framework of the National Technology Initiative with the infrastructure and financing opportunities they offer to companies.",2022,Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,1

The paper aims to shed light on the missing economic interpretation of the reasonable remuneration of employee inventions. Specifically, it focuses on the concept of reasonability at the issue. Design/methodology/approach In an empirical qualitative multiple case-study setting, the paper explores inductively Czech corporate employee inventors' remuneration systems, using typological analysis and M. Weber's interpretative theoretical construct of ideal type. Findings At the first level, reasonability is a function of multi-amount rewarding, a certain level of total remuneration and identifiable benefits being a decisive factor. Additionally, the reasonability is conceptualised as a function of two dimensions - timing/risk and benefit-reward relation. At the second level, the reasonability is interpreted as a concept balancing seven points of view: timing, materiality, equity, risk management, transparency, system costs and exactness. At the third level, the paper offers an optimal remuneration system like the one that optimises developed seven-criterion framework. Originality/value The paper brings unique and detailed empirical insights into the issue of employee inventions. It offers a complex multi-perspective (employee/employer) framework through which the reasonability can be discussed and suggests an optimal system, which can serve as a reference point.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Portable medicine chests and supply of medicines in Serbia from the 1830s to the mid-20th century: analysis of medicines list,; ,"The first portable medicine chests appeared in Serbia immediately after liberation from Ottoman rule around 1830. The network of portable medicine chests grew very quickly and became the first effective public health method of supplying medicines and medical items to people living in cities without community pharmacies and to the rural population in villages. According to their purposes, three categories of portable medicine chests could be identified: Portable medicine chests owned by physicians or veterinarians in the cities, portable medicine chests established by the Department of Workers Health Insurance, and portable medicine chests of the Health Cooperatives that operated in the villages This paper analyzes all three types of portable medicine chests. We specifically examine the regulations concerning the management of portable medicine chests, their content, and supply chains of medicines from the third decade of the 19'h century through the first half of the 20'h century. We conclude that portable medicine chests represent a specific type of pharmacy in the territory of Serbia that provided very effective medical service. The medicines in these pharmacies were handled and dispensed to patients by physicians not by pharmacists. Patent medicines, compounded medicines, sanitary items and bandage materials were dispensed as well. Future research is needed to ascertain if physicians who owned or worked with the portable medicine chests actually prepared and compounded simple preparations as they were specified in the laws.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Chemistry,1
Anchored Differentiation: The Role of Temporal Distance in the Comparison and Evaluation of New Product Designs,product design; design patents; innovation; optimal distinctiveness; mixed methods; OPTIMAL DISTINCTIVENESS; INNOVATION; UNIQUENESS; CULTURE; FORM; PERCEPTIONS; RESPONSES; ART; LAW,"A new design can be compared with its contemporaries or older designs. In this study, we argue that the temporal distance between the new design and its comparison play an important role in understanding how a new design's similarity with other designs contributes to its valuation. Construing the value of designs as a combination of their informational value and their expressive value, we propose the anchored differentiation hypothesis. Specifically, we argue that expressive value (which is enhanced by how much the new design appears different from others) is emphasized more than informational value (which is enhanced by how much the new design appears similar to others) compared with contemporary designs. Informational value, however, is emphasized more than expressive value when compared against designs from the past. Therefore, both difference from other contemporary designs (contemporary differentiation) and similarity to other past designs (past anchoring) help increase the value of a new design. We find consistent evidence for our theory across both a field study and an experimental study. Furthermore, we show that this is because temporal distance changes the relative emphasis on expressive and informational values. We discuss our contribution to the growing literature on optimal distinctiveness and design innovation by offering a dynamic perspective that helps resolve the tension between similarities and differences in evaluating new designs.",2021,Business & Economics,1

Using the establishment of intellectual property courts (IPCs) by the Chinese government in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in 2014 as a quasi-natural experiment, we build a difference in differences model to assess the impact of legal regulation on firm performance from a judicial perspective. The results show that the IPC reform significantly promotes the growth of firm performance, and this incentive effect is realized through the innovation quality mechanism. For different enterprises, the effect of IPC policy is more evident among firms with strong external funding dependence, large enterprise size, large spillover effects, and state ownership. In addition, we calculated sustainability indicators for firms and found that IPCs increased firms' total factor productivity through quality-based innovation mechanisms. The important contribution of this study is that it fills a research gap in examining the impact of legal regulation on firms from a judicial perspective by identifying the relationship between judicial protection of IPRs, innovation, and business performance. This paper has implications for the promotion of judicial reform in countries with weak IPR systems, for developing countries like China, the judicial protection of IPRs should be increased to provide an institutional environment more conducive to enterprise development.",2024,Business & Economics,1
Chemical vapor deposited alumina hard coatings: Residual stress states decisively determined by the physical material properties,a-Al2O3 hard layer; Chemical vapor deposition; Anisotropic stress distribution; Triaxial stress nature; X-ray diffraction; Residual stress determination techniques; X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; THIN-FILMS; CONSTANTS; TEXTURE; ORIGIN; FIELDS,"Machining tools made from cemented carbides coated with protective hard layers are indispensable in machining technology and are examined down to the smallest detail for reasons of patent law. As established in thin film analysis practice, a biaxial stress model is in general used for residual stress evaluation. But important information gets lost as a result of this simplification and the potential for product improvement is wasted. If someone goes into more detail the appearance changes and enables a deeper and more fundamental understanding. The X-ray diffraction study presented demonstrates that the residual stress state in the top alpha-Al2O3-layer is more complex than the usual model assumption of a biaxial stress nature suggests. It can again be shown that the internal stress state arising during the chemical vapor deposition process, is strongly influenced by the thermal expansion behavior of the material under investigation. But the presented results reveal that the impact is much higher than discussed in previous studies. The internal stress field is triaxial, anisotropic and strongly direction-dependent, presumably due to the crystal anisotropy in combination with growth textures of [0 0 1] type.

Severe proximal coronary perforations are usually caused by balloon and vessel size mismatch but can also occur with appropriately sized balloons or stents if the coronary vessel has very eccentric calcification or if there is negative remodelling of the vessel. Case summary A 74-year-old man with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic coronary syndrome (previous PCI 10 years before) presented with unstable angina of 2 weeks of duration. Coronary angiography revealed a patent stent in left anterior descending artery, significant disease in left circumflex artery and diffuse calcified lesion in dominant right coronary artery (RCA). During angioplasty of RCA, the patient developed severe Ellis grade III perforation, which was successfully managed with modified double guiding catheter 'Ping Pong' technique. In this technique, the already engaged 7 French (F) Amplatz Left 1 guide catheter was used to deliver the bulky covered stent in highly tortuous and calcified RCA while a second 6F guide catheter (Judkin Right) introduced through contralateral femoral access was used for introducing the balloon, which initially sealed the perforation and subsequently acted as a distal anchor to provide strong support to deliver the covered stent. Conclusion In a case of severe coronary perforation, modified Ping Pong technique using a small-sized second guide catheter complimentary to the first guide catheter, can be used to deploy bulky covered stent.",2021,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,1
Recurrent Cryptogenic Stroke in a Patient With Left Atrial Septal Pouch,treatment of left atrial septal pouch; pfo; double atrial septum; left atrial septal pouch; cryptogenic stroke; 2-DIMENSIONAL TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; INTERATRIAL SEPTUM; RISK-FACTOR,"The incomplete fusion of the septum primum and septum secundum results in the formation of the left atrial septal pouch (LASP). The clinical significance of this entity is a matter of controversy; however, it may act as a nidus for thrombus formation. We report a case of a 57-year-old male who was brought to the hospital by his girlfriend due to his bizarre behavior and confusion for one day. The initial workup for his altered mental status did not yield a diagnosis. The patient was admitted for further workup, which included an MRI of the brain that showed numerous very small-sized foci of restricted diffusion involving bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres consistent with thromboembolic infarct. The patient did not receive a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) as he was out of the window for TPA. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with bubble study did not show patent foramen ovale (PR)) or atrial septal defect (ASI)). ECG and telemetry showed normal sinus rhythm and no atrial fibrillation. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was obtained to find the source of the thromboembolic stroke. TEE discovered a 22 x 8-mm cystic structure in the interatrial septum consistent with a LASP. We hypothesize that the LASP may be a risk factor for cryptogenic stroke. Further research is needed to determine the prevalence of atrial septa! pouch (ASP) in the general population, its clinical significance, and guidelines for treatment implications.",2022,General & Internal Medicine,1
Prognostic value of increased expression of RBM8A in gastric cancer,Gastric cancer; RBM8A; Proto-oncogene; Prognosis; ,"This study was designed to investigate the expression of RBM8A protein in patients with gastric cancer (GC) and to explore its correlation with clinical pathological features as well as prognosis. One hundred pairs of gastric carcinoma tissues and adjacent tissues from patients undergoing gastrectomy for GC were included in this study. The protein expression level of RBM8A was determined by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. We also detected the mRNA expression level of RBM8A in 16 pairs of gastric carcinoma tissues and adjacent tissues. Meanwhile, we predicted the potential correlation between RBM8A and tumor stages as well as survival condition in patents with GC based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The correlation of RBM8A with the clinical pathological features and prognosis of the 100 patients with GC was also elucidated. The expression level of RBM8A was significantly higher in gastric carcinoma tissues compared to the adjacent tissues. The protein level of RBM8A was correlated with tumor size (P=0.031), depth of invasion (P <0.001), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), TNM stage (<0.001), and distant metastasis (P=0.001). Patients with increased RBM8A expression (P <0.0018, 95%CI=0.322-0.871), higher TNM stage (P<0.001, 95%CI=4.990-11.283), and lymph node metastasis (P<0.001, 95%CI=2.873-4.002) had a lower overall survival. Taken together, our study demonstrated that RBM8A may act as a proto-oncogene, which could be a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in the diagnosis and treatment of GC.",2020,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Research & Experimental Medicine,1
'Prioritized Distribution of Equal Shares'-An Ethical and Practicable Allocation Framework for COVID-19 Vaccines,COVID-19; allocation; vaccine; COVAX; distributional justice; global health ethics; human rights; ,"In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the fast and equitable distribution of effective vaccines worldwide is one of the challenges faced by international institutions in charge, as global equity in vaccine supply has not yet been achieved. Our paper explains the current state of ethical research on equity in global COVID-19 vaccine allocation, focusing on the COVAX Facility established by the WHO, acting as the global vaccine distributor. The article presents a detailed analysis of the first year of COVAX allocation in 2021 identifying problematic aspects of its allocation framework regarding the implementation of COVAX's fundamental allocation principles. We argue that the COVAX Facility has developed a proper concept to deal with global vaccine allocation-but to address uncovered defaults, we introduce the 'Prioritized Distribution of Equal Shares' model-a both ethical and practically feasible alternative allocation framework to protect the value of human lives in both high- and low-income countries through fair and fast global vaccine distribution in health emergencies. Nonetheless, we argue that the COVAX Facility remains the main organization to provide equitable access to vaccines. Yet, the global community has to consider further aspects such as patent protection, vaccine production and the lack of power of global structures to address the inequities that have arisen. Since new wars and further crises have arisen, a shift in public global attention endangers the processing of COVID-19-related issues. That is why now more than ever extensive efforts to achieve vaccine equity are needed.",2023,History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,1
The Public Health Gains Had Cigarette Companies Chosen to Sell Very Low Nicotine Cigarettes,; ,"Introduction: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed lowering the nicotine content of cigarettes to a minimally addictive level to increase smoking cessation and reduce initiation. This study has two aims: (1) to determine when cigarette manufacturers had the technical capability to reduce cigarette nicotine content and (2) to estimate the lost public health benefits of implementing a standard in 1965, 1975, or 1985. Methods: To determine the technical capability of cigarette companies, we reviewed public patents and internal cigarette company business records using the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents. To evaluate the impact of a very low nicotine content cigarette (VLNC) standard on smoking attributable deaths (SADs) and life-years lost (LYLs), we applied a validated (CISNET) model that uses past smoking data, along with estimates of the potential impact of VLNCs derived from expert elicitation. Results: Cigarette manufacturers recognized that cigarettes were deadly and addictive before 1964. Manufacturers have had the technical capability to lower cigarette nicotine content for decades. Our model projected that a standard implemented in 1965 could have averted 21 million SADs (54% reduction) and 272 million LYLs (64% reduction) from 1965 to 2064, a standard implemented in 1975 could have averted 18.9 million SADs and 245.4 million LYLs from 1975 to 2074, and a standard implemented in 1985 could have averted 16.3 million SADs and 211.5 million LYLs from 1985 to 2084. Conclusions: Millions of premature deaths could have been averted if companies had only sold VLNCs decades ago. FDA should act immediately to implement a VLNC standard.",2021,"Substance Abuse; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1

Cyclovirobuxine D (CVB-D) is the main effective component of Huangyangning tablet, an approved traditional patent medicine, which is mainly used for cardiovascular treatment. As a multibioactive natural compound, CVB-D possesses underlying anticancer activities.Experimental ApproachCell viability and clone-forming ability were determined in human CRC lines. Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, transmission electron microscopy and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) staining were utilized to investigate cell autophagy and senescence. The molecular mechanisms were explored by virtual prediction and experimental validation. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX), dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS), and azomethane (AOM)/DSS mouse models were employed for in vivo studies.Key ResultsCVB-D inhibited the growth and development of advanced CRC cells / mice by inducing autophagic and senescent activities through the chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 3 (CCT3)/yes-associated protein (YAP) axis. CVB-D acted as a promising inhibitor of CCT3 by interacting with its ATP site. In PDX tumours, CVB-D showed potential therapeutic effects by targeting CCT3. Treatment with CVB-D alleviated the mouse model of colitis induced by DSS and attenuated AOM/DSS-induced formation of adenomatous polyps by its action on CCT3.Conclusions and ImplicationsOur study has provided a scientific basis for the suggestion that CVB-D may be recognized as a prospective drug candidate for the therapy of CRC in patients. image",2024,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Proangiogenesis effects of compound danshen dripping pills in zebrafish,Angiogenesis; Wound healing; Traditional Chinese medicine; Myocardial infarction; Cardiovascular; Zebrafish; UP-REGULATION; IN-VIVO; ANGIOGENESIS; MECHANISMS,"Background The compound Danshen Dripping Pill (CDDP), which is a mixture of extracts from Radix Salviae and Panax notoginseng, is a patented traditional Chinese medicine that is widely used in multiple countries for relieving coronary heart disease (CHD), but its pharmacological mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we screened the key pharmacological pathways and targets of CDDP that act on CHD using a network pharmacology-based strategy, and the angiogenic activity of CDDP was directly visually investigated in zebrafish embryos in vivo. Methods The potential therapeutic targets and pathways were predicted through a bioinformatics analysis. The proangiogenic effects of CDDP were examined using vascular sprouting assays on subintestinal vessels (SIVs) and optic arteries (OAs) as well as injury assays on intersegmental vessels (ISVs). Pharmacological experiments were applied to confirm the pathway involved. Results Sixty-five potential therapeutic targets of CDDP on CHD were identified and enriched in the PI3K/AKT and VEGF/VEGFR pathways. An in vivo study revealed that CDDP promoted angiogenesis in SIVs and OAs in a dose-dependent manner and relieved the impairments in ISVs induced by lenvatinib, a VEGF receptor kinase inhibitor (VRI). In addition, Vegfaa and Kdrl expression were significantly upregulated after CDDP treatment. Furthermore, the proangiogenic effect of CDDP could be abolished by PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors. Conclusions CDDP has a proangiogenic effect, the mechanism of which involves the VEGF/VEGFR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. These results suggest a new insight into the cardiovascular protective effect of CDDP.",2022,Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1

N.T.B is also prescribed in COVID-19 patients associated with I.P.F. However, it has an extremely low bioavailability of around 4.7%, and hence, researchers are attempting to address this drawback by different approaches. Areas covered This review article focuses on enlisting all the formulation attempts explored by researchers to increase the bioavailability of N.T.B while also providing meaningful insight into the unexplored areas in formulation development, such as targeting of the lymphatic system and transdermal delivery. All the patents on the formulation development of N.T.B have also been summarized. Expert opinion N.T.B has the potential to act on multiple diseases that are still being discovered, but its extremely low bioavailability is a challenge that is to be dealt with for obtaining the full benefit. Few studies have been performed aiming at improving the bioavailability, but there are unexplored areas that can be used, a few of which are explained in this article. However, the ability to reproduce laboratory results when scaling up to the industry level is the only factor to be taken into consideration.",2021,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

The detector is based on the idea that when a beam current is injected into the body of a patient undergoing a charged particle therapy, the current itself can be collected using a conductive electrode in contact with the patient's skin. This new approach was studied in vitro using an electrically isolated water tank irradiated with monoenergetic proton beams. The conductive electrode was immersed in water and positioned outside the irradiation field. The detection system performance was evaluated by comparing its response against a SEM (Secondary Emission Monitor) detector, used as a reference beam current monitor, and an Advanced Markus ionization chamber. Short-, mid- and long-term reproducibility, current monitoring capability, field size dependence, electrode position and environment temperature dependence, linearity with dose, and dose rate dependence were investigated. Few preliminary in vivo tests were also performed that demonstrated the possibility to apply the system in clinical practice. The potential of the proposed method is considerable, representing a simple and economical system for online, in vivo, and noninvasive monitoring of the beam current and relative released dose into the patient during treatment, without perturbing the irradiation field. The system presented in this work is protected with both a National Italian (N. 102017000087851) and an International N.

Comparing Onset of Biosimilar Versus Generic Competition in the United States,; MARKET EXCLUSIVITY; PRESCRIPTION DRUGS; ORIGINS; ENTRY; ACT,"We sought to compare expected and observed biosimilar and generic entry dates among new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2000 and 2012. We defined expected biosimilar and generic entry dates as the later of the expiration of the key patent term or statutory exclusivity (12 years for biologics, 5 years for small molecule drugs not indicated for a rare disease, and 7 years for small molecule drugs indicated for a rare disease; plus 6 months if a pediatric extension had been granted). For drugs with expected entry prior to 2019, we calculated the proportion with observed biosimilar or generic entry. The expected biosimilar entry dates were estimated to be a median of 12.3 years (interquartile range (IQR) 12.0-14.0,n = 60) after FDA approval. The 12-year biologic statutory exclusivity period comprised 98% of the median expected protection period. By contrast, expected generic entry was estimated to be a median of 12.2 years (IQR 8.4-14.0,n=268), or 7.2 years after the 5-year small molecule statutory exclusivity (59% of the total expected market protection period). By 2019, observed biosimilar entry occurred in 12% of cases (3/25) and observed generic entry in 65% (101/155). We concluded that expected US market exclusivity periods are similar for biologic and small molecule drugs. Statutory exclusivity plays a more substantial role in market exclusivity protection for biologics. Biosimilar competition, currently lagging behind generic competition, will likely increase as the biosimilar market becomes established.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

Since the expiration of the patent of the innovator epoetin alfa, numerous rhEPO products have emerged in global markets. As described here, multiple complementary analytical approaches are utilized for the extensive characterization of rhEPO molecules, and more importantly for the structural comparison of the rhEPO analogues on the Chinese market. The focus of this study is placed on the overall glycosylation profiling, O-glycan profiling, and N-glycan mapping by UPLC-MS with an aim to develop an effective analytical methodology to monitor the product quality attributes of rhEPO analogues. Two rhEPO analogues manufactured in China were analyzed to demonstrate the principle of the developed methods. Each rhEPO product showed a characteristic glycoform profile with respect to the distribution of sialic acids across multi-antennary structures, the occurrence of O-glycosylation, O-acetylation on sialic acids, and the extension of N-glycan antennae with N-acetyllactosamine units. The study demonstrates that UPLC-MS is an effective analytical tool to characterize and monitor the glycosylation profiles among rhEPO analogues in order to detect and account for the divergence between rhEPO products, as well as the presence of unusual or unexpected glycans.",2020,Chemistry,1

The use of natural plant extracts as corrosion inhibitors is counted by thousands of papers and industrial patents. Plant extracts contain complex phytochemicals that interact strongly with metallic surface through their electron rich sites. In this context, this review investigates the corrosion inhibitive action of henna (Lawsonia Inermis) leaves extracts on mild steel in various acid media by weight loss measurements (WL) as chemical measurements and by potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as electrochemical ones. The study indicates that as the acid concentration increases, the corrosion rate increases. The corrosion inhibition efficiency increases with an increase in the concentration of the extract. The results obtained reveal that the henna leaves extract acts as an efficient inhibitor. The adsorption of the henna leaves extracts obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The calculated thermodynamic parameters indicate that the adsorption is a spontaneous, exothermic process accompanied by an increase in entropy. Cathodic and anodic polarization curves show that the henna leaves extract is a mixed-type inhibitor. The inhibitory action is generally explained as an intermolecular synergistic effect of different components of the natural extract.",2021,Materials Science,1
Dealing with AI-generated works: lessons from the CDPA section 9(3),; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; AUTHORSHIP,"This article aims to provide some input for revising the text of section 9(3) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA), without proposing a new provision. Specifically, it addresses the question of how this provision should be construed vis-a-vis Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated outputs. Although numerous options have been discussed in literature, so far none of them has comprehensively looked at the broader context in which users of generative AI models give instructions and how these prompts could impact issues of subsistence in AI-generated outputs. This article aims to fill that gap.Before suggesting a new framework for reconsidering the provision of section 9(3) CDPA, this contribution briefly revisits the originality, fixation and human authorship requirements, and explains how these are met when AI is involved in creative processes. Next, it questions whether the copyright regime is the appropriate form of protection for AI-generated outputs. Lastly, it provides an examination of the strengths and weaknesses of section 9(3).This article supports the human-centred approach of the CDPA towards authorship of AI-generated works. However, it also suggests that a more nuanced approach should be adopted. Specifically, it contends that under section 9(3), AI-generated works should belong to the user of the AI model giving instructions only as long as such directions to create are sufficiently original themselves for the purposes of copyright protection. Furthermore, de lege ferenda, this distinction should be expressly included in the text of section 9(3).",2024,Government & Law,1
The Anti-Inflammatory Peptide TnP Is a Candidate Molecule for Asthma Treatment,TnP; peptide drug; inflammatory diseases; asthma; lung remodeling; ,"Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease, with increasing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Accumulation of peribronchial leukocytes is the hallmark of asthma, in particular, eosinophils, which have been reported as the primary cell associated with the induction of airway hyperresponsiveness. Continued exacerbation and accumulation of other leukocytes, such as neutrophils, Th1, and Th17 cells correlate with many of the long-term effects of asthma, such as airway remodeling. We have patented the TnP family of synthetic cyclic peptides, which is in the preclinical phase of developmental studies for chronic inflammatory diseases. The aim of this work was to investigate whether TnP could show anti-inflammatory activity in a murine model of asthma that includes a mixed phenotype of eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation. For this, Balb/c mice, sensitized with OVA and exposed to 1% challenge with OVA aerosol, were submitted to prophylactic treatment, receiving TnP at 0.3 mg/kg orally, 1 h before each challenge. We found that sensitized mice challenged with OVA and treated with TnP showed no airway hyperreactivity or lung remodeling. TnP acts systemically in secondary lymphoid organs and locally in the lung, inhibiting the production of Th2/Th17 cytokines. Furthermore, TnP prevented the infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils in the BAL and lung tissue, inhibited the production of IgE/IgG1, prevented hyperplasia of mucus-producing cells, and decreased the thickening and deposition of sub-epithelial collagen. Our results showed TnP as a candidate molecule for the treatment of airway remodeling associated with inflammatory diseases, such as asthma.",2023,Cell Biology,1

Analysis of the crystallographic data available for the human CA isoform II in adduct with two coumarin CAIs and some CAAs showed that both types of CA modulators bind in the same region of the enzyme active site, basically interacting with superimposable amino acid residues, that are Trp5, Asn62, His64, Asn67, Gln92, Thr200. A plethora of water molecules also participate in the adducts formation. This structural analysis showed that presence of certain chemical groups in the compound structure is mandatory to produce an activating rather than inhibitory action, such as multiple nitrogen- and oxygen-based moieties capable of shuttling protons or forming extended H-bond networks nearby the proton shuttle residue. This constitutes the only known example among all enzymes of an identical binding site for inhibitors and activators, which, in addition, possess significant pharmacological applications.

Due to the severe side effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, there is an urgent need to find new natural or synthetic chemicals that could act as selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The most valuable source of new bioactive compounds and potential drugs are plants. The present study aimed at the investigation of Levidor (TM), a patented composition based on oil from the seeds of Nigella sativa and extract from the root of Angelica archangelica, regarding its potential anti-inflammatory effects on the molecular level. Materials and Methods. Studies were carried out with the use of murine macrophages (RAW 264.7), human monocytes (U937), and rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cell lines. The cytotoxicity of the Levidor (TM) extract was evaluated by MTT assay. The concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha) was evaluated by ELISA. Moreover, the analysis of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expression levels by RT-PCR, as well as protein level by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining, were assessed. Results. The Levidor (TM) extract did not impact cell growth and showed anti-inflammatory effect in the present study. It was able to decrease the level of IL-6, TNF-alpha and suppress transcription of COX-2, whereas it had no effect on COX-1. Conclusions. Obtained results showed that Levidor (TM) exhibits strong anti-inflammatory properties and may provide a significant alternative to traditionally used medicines in acute pain and chronic inflammation.",2023,Research & Experimental Medicine,1
Building and nurturing a learning culture: a cross-dynamic and interactional perspective,Learning organizations; Self-directed learning; Learning culture; Interactional perspective; ORGANIZATION; INDIVIDUALS; STRATEGIES,"PurposeIf building and nurturing a learning organization is not a random chance, the question of where organizations should start is patent. Because learning culture is one of the core components of learning organizations, it is wondered how individuals and organizations contribute to this phenomenon. Under an interactional perspective, the authors explore the cross-dynamics between learning resources, structure and support (organizational level), and self-directed learning (individual level).Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted qualitative and exploratory research in Spring 2021 in France. They used semi-structured interviews with HRMs and a Delphi panel as the main instruments. This dual approach brings a reflexive and complementary dialogue to the research question.FindingsThe results show that non-learning organizations took advantage of the Covid-19 period. They created a learning biotope and fostered learning dynamics. Although this biotope acted as a learning marketplace and lacked guidance, individuals interacted with this learning biotope. They took learning initiatives and developed their self-directed learning. This understanding argues for constant interaction and co-influence between organizations and individuals to build and nurture a learning culture.Originality/valueThere is little discussion on how individuals and organizations contribute to building and nurturing a learning culture from an interactional perspective. Furthermore, literature on learning organizations considers self-directedness as a whole, considering self-directed learning as a characteristic and a process sharpens thinking.

Surveys were administered to academics from research centres or units in Portugal's Northern Region and Spain's Castile and Leon. Data were also collected from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS2014) conducted in Portugal and Spain, to obtain a broader perspective on the topic and regions under analysis. A comparison could thus be made between the researchers' perspective (i.e. micro) and the companies' perspective that answered the CIS questionnaire (i.e. meso) on U-I collaboration dynamics. The questionnaires were analysed using Partial least squares structural equation modelling, and the data from CIS survey using logistic regression. The results show that U-I cooperation is associated with (i) time spent on research and development, (ii) budgets based on direct contracts with industries, (iii) companies' location and (iv) incentives for collaboration. However, the researchers' age and academic field are the only factors affecting which incentives for collaboration are significant. The results also reveal that U-I collaboration influences regions' innovation profiles. These findings contribute to a fuller, more empirical understanding of U-I cooperation, demonstrating that encouragement of this type of collaboration can be a driver of innovation in any region. This article contributes in policy terms to a better understanding of the necessary incentives for both U-I collaboration and the internationalisation of this collaboration.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration; Urban Studies,1
"AI, on the Law of the Elephant: Toward Understanding Artificial Intelligence",; HUMAN-RIGHTS; MACHINE; LIMITS; RULES; STATE,"Machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) systems are changing our world in profound, exponentially rapid, and likely irreversible ways.(3) Although AI may be harnessed for great good,(4) it is capable of and is doing great harm at scale to people, communities, societies, and democratic institutions.(5) The dearth of AI governance leaves unchecked AI's potentially existential risks.(6) Whether sounding urgent alarm or merely jumping on the bandwagon, law scholars, law students, and lawyers at bar are contributing volumes of AI policy and legislative proposals, commentaries, doctrinal theories, and calls to corporate and international organizations for ethical AI leadership.' Unfortunately, erroneous, incomplete, and overly simplistic treatments of AI technology undermine the utility of a significant portion of that literature. Moreover, many of those treatments are piecemeal, and those gaps produce barriers to the proper legal understanding of AI. Profound concerns exist about M and the actual and potential crises of societal, democratic, and individual harm that it causes or may cause in future. On the whole, the legal community is not currently equal to the task of addressing those concerns, lacking sufficient Al knowledge and technological competence, despite ethical mandates for diligence and competence. As-8 a result, law and policy debates and subsequent actions may be fundamentally flawed or produce devastating unintended consequences because they relied upon erroneous, uninformed, or misconceived understandings of M technologies, inputs, and processes. Like the elephant in the ancient Jain parable, the wise ones may conceive of only a fraction of the AI creature and some more or less blindly.(9) Now more than ever, lawyers need to be able to see around critically important corners. The general lack of understanding about AI technology robs the legal profession of that foresight. This state of affairs also raises significant ethical concerns. Worse, it undermines lawyers' power, authority, and legitimacy to bring forward truly valid, meaningful ideas and solutions to prevent AI from becoming humanity's apex predator.(10) This Article responds with several descriptive and theoretical contributions. As to its descriptive contributions, it aims to correct and augment the record about AI, particularly machine learning and its underlying technologies and processes. It endeavors to present a concisely and accessibly stated foundational, but sufficiently comprehensive, single-source explanation. The Article draws extensively from the scientific and technical literatures and undertakes an important interdisciplinary translational process by which to map the AI technical lexicon(12) to legal terms of art and constructions in patent and other cases. (13)Because their understanding is foundational, the Article drills down on three principal AI inputs: data, including data curation; statistical models; and algorithms. It then engages in illustrative issue-spotting within these AI factual frames, sketching out some of the many legal implications associated with those vital understandings. Toward its theoretical contributions, the Article presents two conceptual sortings of AI and introduces a systems- and process-engineering-inspired taxonomy of AI. First, it categorizes AI by the degree of human involvement in and, conversely, the degree of AI autonomy in AI-mediated decision-making. Second, it conceptualizes AI as being static or dynamic. Those distinctions are vital to AI's potential for harm, meaningful accountability, and, ultimately, the proper prioritization of AI governance efforts. Third, the Article briefly introduces a taxonomy that conceptualizes AI as a human-machine enterprise made up of series of processes. By perceiving the whole of the AI elephant, the role of human decision-making and its limits may be understood, and the human-machine enterprise that is AI and its constituent processes may be deconstructed, comprehended, and framed for subsequent scholarship, doctrinal and procedural analyses, and law and policy developments. With these, the Article hopes to help inform and empower lawyers to improve the security, justness, and well-being of people in the increasingly algorithmic world.",2021,Government & Law,1
Procuring NGA infrastructure: The performance of EMAT auctions in Italy,NGA; Public procurement; EMAT/MEAT; First-price sealed-bid auction; Market competition; Industrial policy; STATE AID; PROCUREMENT AUCTIONS; PUBLIC PROCUREMENT; POLICY; COMPETITION; DESIGN; CONTRACTS; PRICE,"Italy was a patent laggard in the market roll-out of NGA networks. In 2015, the Italian Government introduced the ultrabroadband strategy, an ambitious policy agenda addressing the NGA market failures. This paper assesses the procurement policy assigning public concessions to build and manage passive infrastructure in NGA white areas: in detail, the techno-economic properties and outcomes of the auctions are analyzed, both theoretically and empirically. Because the applicable procurement law was the EU one, the EMAT scoring rules were mandatory. Relevant findings stand out, which confirm the received wisdom on first-price auctions, and extend it to high-tech sectors, where EMAT remains under-researched. First, the concession auctions unleashed vibrant bidding competition in many white areas, which enabled substantial budget savings. Second, the quality scoring rules provided adequate flexibility to prioritize the procurement of the most innovative and pro-competitive architectures (FTTH/B/P), despite the presence of high uncertainty. Third, the EMAT framework catered for a multidimensional procurement agenda; the latter targeted efficient and innovative procurement, universal service and higher market competition, while accommodating the ambitious industrial policy of the Government. Evidence of a potential trade-off between the plan implementation delay and its innovativeness emerged; such a conflict was eventually exacerbated by the bandwidth shortages generated by the COVID-19 crisis. By providing the very first study on EMAT auctions for broadband, this work stimulates future comparative research on additional EU member States.",2021,Communication; Information Science & Library Science; Telecommunications,1
Which mode of governance for the innovation cities of Moroccan public universities?,innovation; innovation city; Morocco; patent; public research; start-up; valorization; ,"The project to create innovation cities is part of the national innovation strategy developed since 2009, and of Law No. 01.00 on the organization of higher education which allowed to adopt judicious programs relating to the valorization of research and innovation within the universities. Therefore, to promote the valorization of research and to make society benefit from its results, various initiatives have been initiated. These initiatives gave birth to the Innovation Cities project. This project was designed around the axes of governance, regulatory framework, infrastructure, financing, support, and talent mobilization. Nevertheless, despite the results obtained, in terms of innovation and valorization of scientific research and also in terms of development of the entrepreneurial culture, difficulties hinder the management and governance of these complex ecosystems. As a result, the expected objectives could not be reached. The problematic posed is to question the difficulties encountered which are more related to the lack of adequate governance mode for this kind of structures allowing them to be able to release energies and promote innovation. In which, we will, in the first step, identify the difficulties due to the lack of efficient governance, and in the second step, show the different possible scenarios, proposed within the framework of the European Erasmus+ INSITES project Institutionalization of Innovation and Knowledge Transfer Structures, in view of the requirement of the missions of the cities of innovation and of the regulation in force, to implement an enlightened, transparent and quality governance.",2023,Government & Law,1
Development and Research of Crosshead-Free Piston Hybrid Power Machine,reciprocating compressor; piston pump; piston hybrid power machine; work processes; indicator efficiency of the compressor; ,"This article considers the development and research of a new design of crosshead-free piston hybrid power machine. After verification of a system of simplifying assumptions based on the fundamental laws of energy, mass, and motion conservation, as well as using the equation of state, mathematical models of the work processes of the compressor section, pump section, and liquid flow in a groove seal have been developed. In accordance with the patent for the invention, a prototype of a crosshead-free piston hybrid power machine (PHPM) was developed; it was equipped with the necessary measuring equipment and a stand for studying the prototype. Using the developed mathematical model, the physical picture of the ongoing work processes in the compressor and pump sections is considered, taking into account their interaction through a groove seal. Using the developed plan, a set of experimental studies was carried out with the main operational parameters of the crosshead-free PHPM: operating processes, temperature of the cylinder-piston group and integral parameters (supply coefficient of the compressor section, volumetric efficiency of the pump section, etc.). As a result of numerical and experimental studies, it was determined that this PHPM design has better cooling of the compressor section (decrease in temperature of the valve plate is from 10 to 15 K; decrease in temperature of intake air is from 6 to 8 K, as well as there is increase in compressor and pump section efficiency up to 5%).",2021,Engineering,1
Analysis of the Negative Relationship between Blockchain Application and Corporate Performance,; SUPPLY CHAIN; ACCOUNTING INFORMATION; SMART CONTRACTS; AGENCY COSTS; TECHNOLOGY; OPERATIONS; GOVERNMENT; IMPACT; FUTURE; FIRM,"Blockchain technology is one of the most critical emerging technologies. Countries are promoting the development of blockchain technology vigorously. Theoretically, blockchain technology improves the trust between enterprises, reduces information asymmetry, and promotes efficiency. It should promote corporate performance, but analyzing the actual data of Chinese listed companies, contrary to expectation, blockchain technology makes corporate performance decline. We found that this is mainly due to the effect of adverse selection through analysis and empirical tests. The enterprises that use blockchain technology are not accompanied by the increase in R&D expenditure, investment expenditure, and patents. The companies' abnormal stock return and stock turnover rate have increased. The enterprises with worse performance are more likely to use blockchain to the hype. They can gain a short-term stock return. However, in the long run, the market-to-book ratio of government subsidies and the growth rate of corporate income are declining. Furthermore, the financial constraints are not alleviated as adverse selection only plays a role in the short term. Besides, the heterogeneity tests find that from the prospects of internal governance environment, the higher proportion of the largest shareholder, the better earning quality of the company. The enterprises with state-owned property rights have lower motivations of using blockchain to make an adverse selection. The study also found that the external environment prospects of enterprises with a lower degree of marketization and law environment are more likely to use the blockchain.",2021,Computer Science; Telecommunications,1
Intellectual Property and the Constitutional Court of South Africa: Lessons from the Deployment of Adjudicative Strategies,Copyright; Trade mark; Patent; Intellectual property and constitutional rights; South Africa; ,"The Constitutional Court of South Africa recently handed down its fourth decision so far in the field of intellectual property. These decisions came against the backdrop of reforms and reform proposals concerning intellectual property rights in South Africa. These reforms and reform proposals were prompted by the need to establish intellectual property laws that are attuned to South Africa's local context and needs, while complying with South Africa's international treaty obligations. Parallel to South Africa's policy and legislative agenda, this paper recognises these four decisions (referred to as the IP quartet) as the emergence of an intellectual property rights jurisprudence. The paper analyses the IP quartet and identifies a coherent narrative with respect to the intersection between intellectual property rights and constitutional rights and the appropriate approach to determining their real-life applications. The paper also explains this intellectual property rights jurisprudence and its contribution, and considers the adjudicative strategies employed by the Constitutional Court in applying constitutional provisions to dealing with issues involving intellectual property rights. An explanation of this jurisprudence arising from these cases will: (a) promote an understanding of the scope of intellectual property rights including the appropriate nature of their intersection with constitutional provisions (specifically fundamental rights expressed in Chapter 2 of the South African Constitution); and (b) offer some guidance to lower courts and the executive arm of government on the appropriate approach to the interpretation, conceptualization and application of the intellectual property legal framework.",2023,Government & Law,1
Georgia-Pacific Factors Applied To U.S. Patent Cases with R.O.C. Companies Being Parties - Through Lens of Testimonial Experts,reasonable royalty; lost profits; price erosion; apportionment; enhanced damages; ,"Despite of the criticisms to the Georgia-Pacific, current U.S. case laws still apply these factors for calculating damages in related disputes, including R.O.C. companies being parties. Companies registered in R.O.C. are involving in U.S. cases related to reasonable royalty, wherein O2 v. BiTech and O2 v. Sumida are examples. R.O.C. companies are confronting with certain circumstances. One is that the competitive relationship with trading parties which may lead to a price erosion issue. An even more popular one is that manufacturing of components rather than whole systems which may lead to an apportionment issue. In these issues, some Georgia-Pacific factors may be applicable while others have limited applicability. However, there are circumstances, e.g., allocating the award, where reasonable royalty is not adopted at all due to failure of expert testimony. While competitive relation of Factor (5) is applicable to price erosion issue, convoyed sale of Factor (6) may not be quite helpful to apportionment issue, and hardly any factor can be found to enhanced award or split award, especially when expert testimony of Factor (14) failed to meet the requirements. So, limitation to certain factors in certain circumstances are shown. Since the expert testimony, as long as it fulfills associated requirements, is always applicable to related issues in reasonable royalty cases and thus deserved more attention when dealing with analogous cases in the future.",2023,Government & Law,1

Background During the resuscitation of a newborn infant in the first minutes after birth, clinicians must monitor crucial physiological adjustments that are relatively unobservable, unpredictable, and highly variable. Clinicians' access to information regarding the physiological status of the infant is also crucial to determining which interventions are most appropriate. To design displays to support clinicians during newborn resuscitation, we must first carefully consider the information requirements. Methods We conducted a work domain analysis (WDA) for the neonatal transition in the first 10 min after birth. We split the work domain into two 'subdomains'; the physiology of the neonatal transition, and the clinical resources supporting the neonatal transition. A WDA can reveal information requirements that are not yet supported by resources. Results The physiological WDA acted as a conceptual tool to model the exact processes and functions that clinicians must monitor and potentially support during the neonatal transition. Importantly, the clinical resources WDA revealed several capabilities and limitations of the physical objects in the work domain-ultimately revealing which physiological functions currently have no existing sensor to provide clinicians with information regarding their status. Conclusion We propose two potential approaches to improving the clinician's information environment: (1) developing new sensors for the information we lack, and (2) employing principles of ecological interface design to present currently available information to the clinician in a more effective way.",2021,Anesthesiology,1
Destructive interparental conflict affects Chinese children's emotional and behavioral problems: Indirect pathways via parent-child attachment and emotional insecurity,destructive interparental conflict; parent-child attachment; emotional insecurity; Chinese children; emotional and behavioral problems; RESOURCE-CONTROL STRATEGIES; ADJUSTMENT; QUESTIONNAIRE; DIFFICULTIES; METAANALYSIS; SECURITY; HEALTH; FUTURE; ROLES,"BackgroundPrevious studies have demonstrated that destructive interparental conflict (IPC) is closely related to the emergence of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents. In addition, in the family system, such conflict also affects the patent-child attachment relationship and emotional insecurity of adolescents. ObjectivesThis study mainly explores the relationship between destructive interparental conflict and adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems, focuses on the role of parent-child attachment and emotional insecurity, and analyzes whether this relationality plays multiple mediating roles in the influence of destructive interparental conflict on emotional and behavioral problems. MethodsData for the study were obtained through a questionnaire survey conducted on 524 Chinese adolescents from primary and junior high school. ResultsStructural equation modeling was conducted to test direct and indirect pathways between destructive interparental conflict and Chinese adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems. Destructive IPC negatively predicted parent-child attachment and parent-child attachment negatively predicted emotional and behavioral problems. Destructive Interparental conflict positively predicted emotional insecurity and emotional insecurity positively predicted emotional and behavioral problems. DiscussionThe results show that: (1) Parent-child attachment negatively predicted emotional and behavioral problems, and emotional insecurity positively predicted the same. (2) Parent-child attachment and emotional insecurity act in a multiple mediating role between destructive IPC and adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems. (3) Parent-child attachment and emotional insecurity constitute two indirect pathways between destructive IPC and adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems, respectively. ConclusionDestructive IPC can adversely affect emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents; destructive IPC plays a damaging role in their emotional security and parent-child attachment, consequently effecting emotional and behavioral problems.",2022,Psychology,1
PIK3C3 Acts as a Tumor Suppressor in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Was Regulated by MiR-340-5p,Cell Proliferation; Esophageal Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; AUTOPHAGY; INHIBITION; PI3K; EXPRESSION; CANCER,"Background: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), a major histological subtype of esophageal cancer, is a common cause of tumor-related deaths in the world. Due to the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of ESCC, its clinical treatment is still a big challenge. In the present study, we aimed to identify an ESCC-related gene in the GEO dataset, and to explore its function and mechanism in ESCC. Material/Methods: The GSE dataset (GSE100492) consisting of 10 samples was analyzed using GEO2R for identifying the differ- entially expressed genes between ESCC and normal samples. Expression levels of mRNA and miRNA in ESCC tissues and cells were detected via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression was analyzed by western blot. Cell proliferation viability was determined through MTT and colony formation. Cell distribution and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. MiRNA target prediction was analyzed by bioinformatics. The interplay between miR-340-5p and PIK3C3 was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results: PIK3C3 was lowly expressed in ESCC tissue and indicated a poor prognosis in patents. Overexpression of PIK3C3 in vitro repressed cell proliferation of KYSE-150 and TE-12 cells. Moreover, PIK3C3 overexpression was demonstrated to enhance the sensitivity of KYSE-150 and TE-12 cells to irradiation. In addition, miR-340-5p was revealed to directly bind and negatively modulate PIK3C3 expression in ESCC. Blockage of miR-340-5p promoted ESCC cell proliferation, while rescue of PIK3C3 reversed this effect. MiR-340-5p was highly expressed in ESCC tissue and it exhibited a negative correlation with PIK3C3 expression. Conclusions: MiR-340-5p functioned as an oncogene of ESCC by directly binding and repressing the expression of PIK3C3.",2020,Research & Experimental Medicine,1
Implantation of the coronary sinus reducer for refractory angina due to coronary microvascular dysfunction in the context of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-a case report,Refractory angina; Coronary microvascular dysfunction; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Angina pectoris; Myocardial ischaemia; Coronary sinus reducer; Case report; EFFICACY; INSIGHTS,"Background Refractory angina leads to a poor quality of life and increased healthcare resource utilization. In this growing population of patients, multiple mechanism(s) of ischaemia may co-exist, including functional disorders of the coronary microcirculation. There are few evidence-based effective therapies resulting in a large unmet clinical need. Case summary A 38-year-old woman with refractory angina was referred with daily chest pain despite multiple anti-anginal medications and previous percutaneous coronary intervention. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography (PET) with regadenoson stress confirmed significant myocardial ischaemia in the apex and apical regions (16% of total myocardium) with a global myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) of 1.23. Coronary angiography confirmed patent stents and no epicardial coronary artery disease. Therefore, the mechanism of ischaemia was thought attributable to coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) in the context of HCM. In view of her significant symptoms and large burden of left-sided myocardial ischaemia, a Coronary Sinus Reducer (CSR) was implanted. Repeat PET imaging at 6 months showed a marked reduction in ischaemia (<5% burden), improvement in global MPR (1.58), symptoms, and quality of life. Conclusion In refractory angina, ischaemia may be due to disorders of both the epicardial and coronary microcirculations. The CSR is a potential therapy for these patients, but its mechanism of action has not been confirmed. This report suggests that CSR implantation may reduce myocardial ischaemia and improve symptoms by acting on the coronary microcirculation. The efficacy of CSR in patients with CMD and its mechanism of action on the coronary microcirculation warrant further investigation.",2022,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,1

Hutch is effective herbs to prevent aggravation of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, both of them show severe side effects in the reproductive system and other systems. Kunxian Capsule (KX), a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) patent prescription, comprised of 4 herbs, including H.Lev. Hutch, is reported to be an available prescription in treating RA with fewer side effects as compares to Tripterygium tablets. To reveal the pharmacological mechanism of KX in RA treatment and side effect alleviation, we collected related information of KX from open-access databases and performed various analyses. 1354 targets were identified in KX. These targets were enriched in the calcium signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, forming biological functions, such as cofactor binding, coenzyme binding, etc. These pathways or functions mostly affect cell cycle, differentiation, and maturation of Th17 cells, macrophage, and synovial fibroblast. These targets also act on the IL-17 signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway, which is related to inflammation response inhibition. Next, a disease network was constructed, which indicated IMPDH2, MTHFD1 are the key genes answering for the side effects of H.Lev. Hutch. The side effect-related genes lead to the negative regulation of nucleic acid, which could be restored by the rest 3 herbs through some positive amino acid metabolism. In conclusion, KX is a relatively safe alternative approach in RA intervention.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Heterogenic institutional investors and their influence on corporate innovation: Evidence from a transition economy,corporate innovation; pressure-sensitive institutional investors; pressure-resistance institutional investors; R&D intensity; institutional investors; China; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FIRM INNOVATION; POLITICAL CONNECTIONS; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; EFFICIENCY; CHINA,"Purpose: The literature lacks a specific mechanism that may help to explain the variation in corporate innovation. This research helps to explain a specific mechanism that affects corporate innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression has been used to analyse the data collected from Chinese manufacturing firms listed on Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchanges from 2007 to 2015. Innovation input has been measured through research and development (R&D) expense scaled by total assets, while the number of forward invention patent citations has been used to measure the quality of innovation performance. Findings/results: The results show that pressure-resistance institutional investors (PR institutions) encourage, while pressure-sensitive institutional investors (PS institutions) discourage R&D intensity. Additionally, exploring the efficiency logic, results show that PR institutions positively moderate both in SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and non-SOEs, while in contrast, PS institutions negatively moderate only in non-SOEs. Overall, the results support our argument that institutional investors' business relations act as a mechanism that affects not only their fiduciary responsibilities, but also their proneness to pressure which in turn affects corporate innovation. Practical implications: There is a great need to protect institutional investors from forming business relations with firms in which they invest. This strategy will help institutional investors to perform their valuable role in enhancing corporate innovation. Originality/value: The article contributes to the existing literature by highlighting institutional investors' heterogenic behaviour. Second, this research highlights institutional investors' business relations, which affect R&D intensity and innovation performance.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Anesthesia management for a child with the Koolen-de Vries syndrome: a case report,Koolen-de Vries syndrome; Rare disease; tracheo/laryngomalacia; Airway management; ,"Background The Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS) is a relatively new rare disease caused by micro-deletion of 17q21.31 which was first reported by Koolen in 2006. Typical phenotypes for KdVS include hypotonia, developmental delay, moderate intellectual disability, and characteristic facial dysmorphism. Up to now, there was only one case report about anesthesia management of patient diagnosed KdVS. It was a 2-year-old girl who experienced an MRI exam under anesthesia.Case presentation We described a 21-month-old boy who planned to undergo an orchidopexy under general anesthesia diagnosed with KdVS. He had an intellectual disability, characteristic facial dysmorphism, tracheo/laryngomalacia, patent foramen ovale, and cryptorchidism related to KdVS. Due to the complex condition especially the presence of tracheo/laryngomalacia, we took some special measures, including reducing the amount of long-acting opioid, keeping the spontaneous breath, performing a caudal block, and applying the laryngeal mask. But the laryngeal mask was changed to an endotracheal tube because it failed to provide adequate ventilation. The boy experienced mild laryngeal spasm and hypoxia after extubation, but lateral position and etomidate eased his breathing problem and re-intubation was avoided. It is indicated that anesthesia management for patients with orphan disease is a real challenge for all anesthesia providers.Conclusions The Koolen-de Vries syndrome is a relatively new orphan disease involving multiple systems. Keeping spontaneous breath, evaluating airway potency to anesthetics, applying endotracheal tube, and post-extubation lateral or prone position may be helpful for airway management for patient with hypotonia and tracheo/laryngomalacia. KdVS patient needs prolonged post-anesthesia monitoring and/or medication for airway complications.",2024,Anesthesiology,1

Transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions are a major contributor to adverse drug reactions. However, the research on transporter-mediated Traditional Chinese medicine injection-drug interactions is limited. Shuganning injection is a widely used Traditional Chinese medicine injection for treating various liver diseases. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of Shuganning injection and its four main ingredients (baicalin, geniposide, chlorogenic acid, and oroxylin A) on 9 drug transporters. Shuganning injection strongly inhibited organic anion transporter 1 and organic anion transporter 3 with IC (50) values < 0.1% (v/v), and moderately inhibited organic anion transporter 2, organic anion transporting-polypeptide 1B1, and organic anion transporting-polypeptide 1B3 with IC (50) values < 1.0%. Baicalin, the most abundant bioactive ingredient in the Shuganning injection, was identified as both an inhibitor and substrate of organic anion transporter 1, organic anion transporter 3, and organic anion transporting-polypeptide 1B3. Oroxylin A had the potential to act as both an inhibitor and substrate of organic anion transporting-polypeptide 1B1 and organic anion transporting-polypeptide 1B3. In contrast, geniposide and chlorogenic acid had no significant inhibitory effect on drug transporters. Notably, Shuganning injection markedly altered the pharmacokinetics of furosemide and atorvastatin in rats. Using Shuganning injection as an example, our findings support the implementation of transporter-mediated Traditional Chinese medicine injection-drug interactions in the development of Traditional Chinese medicine injection standards.",2023,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1

The development of resistance to the currently available insecticidal products adds another critical driver for new insecticidal active ingredients (AIs). One avenue to meeting these challenges is the creation of new classes of insecticidal molecules to act as starting points and prototypes stimulating further spectrum, efficacy and environmental impact refinements. A new class of insecticides is foreshadowed by the first molecule exemplifying that class (first-in-class, FIC) and offers one measure of innovation within the agrochemical industry. Most insecticides owe their discovery to competitor-inspired (i.e. competitor patents/products) or next-generation (follow-on to a company's pre-existing product) strategies. In contrast, FIC insecticides primarily emerge from a bioactive hypothesis approach, with the largest segment resulting from the exploration of new areas of chemistry/heterocycles and underexploited motifs. Natural products also play an important role in the discovery of FIC insecticides. Understanding the origins of these FIC compounds and the approaches used in their discovery can provide insights into successful strategies for future FIC insecticides. This review analyses information on historic and recently introduced FIC insecticides. Its main objective has been to identify the most successful discovery strategies for identifying new agrochemical solutions to meet the challenge of minimizing crop losses resulting from insects.

Corruption and firm innovation: a grease or sand in the wheels of commerce? Evidence from lower-middle and upper-middle income economies,Corruption; Innovation; Africa; Asia; Lower and upper-middle income; MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; GROWTH EVIDENCE; PERFORMANCE; TRANSITION; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; DETERMINANTS; PERSISTENCE; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT,"The phenomenon of corruption has become topical in contemporary development discourse as it is generally believed that corruption has adverse implications especially in developing countries at both micro and macroeconomic levels. This paper examines the effect of corruption on firm's innovativeness using firm-level data drawn from 33 lower-middle and upper-middle income economies. Four analytical approaches: OLS, 2SLS, Probit and IV Probit estimations were employed to correct for the potential endogeneity in corruption and also allow for the effect of corruption to vary by region and income status. Results show that albeit corruption acts as a sand in the wheels of commerce, its effect on innovation varies significantly across regions and income status: While corruption generally has a negative and significant effect on firm innovativeness, its effect is more intense in lower-middle income countries and Africa. Corruption reduces the likelihood of firm's adoption of innovation such as acquisition of quality ISO certificates, patents and undertaking excellent market research and development, a finding which is more pronounced in the case of lower-middle-income economies and Africa. The main policy implication from this study is the unparalleled trade-off between corruption and institutional quality within the public sector. As a policy recommendation, institutional weaknesses and failures that manifest in the public sector in Asia and Africa need to be urgently tackled so as to reduce corruption and its deleterious effects on firm innovation.",2021,Business & Economics,1
Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography Q-Exactive-Orbitrap mass spectrometry and molecular network analysis alongside network pharmacology to elucidate the active constituents and mechanism of action of Huahong tablet in treating pelvic inflammatory disease,; ,"RationaleHuahong tablet, a commonly used clinical Chinese patent medicine, shows good efficacy in treating pelvic inflammation and other gynaecological infectious diseases. However, the specific composition of Huahong tablets, which are complex herbal formulations, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to identify the active compounds and targets of Huahong tablets and investigate their mechanism of action in pelvic inflammatory diseases.MethodsWe utilised ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography Q-Exactive-Orbitrap mass spectrometry and the relevant literature to identify the chemical components of Huahong tablets. The GNPS database was employed to further analyse and speculate on the components. Potential molecular targets of the active ingredients were predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction website. Protein-protein interaction analysis was conducted using the STRING database, with visualisation in Cytoscape 3.9.1.

It contributes to a significant socioeconomic burden on patients, families, and care providers in comparison to cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke in general. Recently, a hybridized approach based on multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) has received considerable attention to develop therapeutic agents for AD which act at multiple targets. Approximately 20% of the drugs approved in the past couple of years were developed using the same strategy and thus it seems to be the right approach to develop AD therapy. The comprehensive and updated review on coumarin hybrids as MTDLs in AD therapy is compiled using several electronic databases such as Scopus, Google Scholar, SciFinder, Mendeley, and PubMed. The research studies published on coumarin hybrids in the last decade (2010-2020) have been covered in this review article. This updated review highlights the importance of coupling (hybridization) coumarin scaffold with other bioactive pharmacophores to develop MTDLs for AD therapy. It also covers the patents granted to coumarin derivatives for AD treatment, natural products containing coumarin scaffold with anti-Alzheimer spectrum, the rationale for coupling pharmacophore fragments, detailed structure activity relationship (SAR), and molecular docking studies.

Despite decades of research, no effective disease modifying therapeutics have reached clinics for treatment/management of PD. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) which controls membrane trafficking and lysosomal function and its variant LRRK2-G2019S are involved in the development of both familial and sporadic PD. LRRK2, is therefore considered as a legitimate target for the development of therapeutics against PD. During the last decade, efforts have been made to develop effective, safe and selective LRRK2 inhibitors and also our understanding about LRRK2 has progressed. However, there is an urge to learn from the previously designed and reported LRRK2 inhibitors in order to effectively approach designing of new LRRK2 inhibitors. In this review, we have aimed to cover the pre-clinical studies undertaken to develop small molecule LRRK2 inhibitors by screening the patents and other available literature in the last decade. We have highlighted LRRK2 as targets in the progress of PD and subsequently covered detailed design, synthesis and development of diverse scaffolds as LRRK2 inhibitors. Moreover, LRRK2 inhibitors under clinical development has also been discussed. LRRK2 inhibitors seem to be potential targets for future therapeutic interventions in the treatment and management of PD and this review can act as a cynosure for guiding discovery, design, and development of selective and non-toxic LRRK2 inhibitors. Although, there might be challenges in developing effective LRRK2 inhibitors, the opportunity to successfully develop novel therapeutics targeting LRRK2 against PD has never been greater.",2024,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,1
A Hydraulic Evapotranspiration Multisensor,irrigation scheduling; patent; sensor; microclimate; GREENHOUSE,"An exclusively mechanical stand-alone automatic device, self-adjusting to weather changes for controlled irrigation, that operates only on the energy of piped water, without electricity, is the described low-cost Hydraulic Evapotranspiration Multisensor-HEM. It is composed of an Evaporation Pan with water left to evaporate, a Floater with a Magnet floating in this water, a Hydraulic Device managing a Hydraulic Water Valve having means to adjust irrigation frequency, and a system that returns water to said Pan, through an Adjustable Dripper, to replace that lost by evaporation. During the Evaporation Phase, gradually the water level is lowered to a predetermined level, at which the floating Magnet acts on said Hydraulic Device to start irrigation. Water from the irrigation line is returned to the Evaporation Pan at the proper for the irrigation time rate. When the lost water is replaced irrigation is terminated and the system resets. On installation Irrigation Frequency and Irrigation Time are set with two graduated screws, for normal weather and the conditions of the particular plantation. HEM responding to weather changes modifies the irrigation schedule set, either by shortening, at a high evaporation rate, the time interval between consecutive irrigation cycles to protect plantations from water deficit stress or extending this time interval at a low evaporation rate to save water. Assessing the performance of HEM, by taking the estimations of evapotranspiration from the Penman-Monteith method shows high accuracy in the studied site. Considering the advantages of the product against the programmable irrigation controller devices, HEM provides optimum irrigation control in field crops and makes it a powerful green tool to be used in Mediterranean greenhouses.",2022,Agriculture,1

Drug-target interactions can be inferred by in silico prediction using bioinformatics and computational tools. We patented the TnP family of synthetic cyclic peptides, which is in the preclinical stage of developmental studies for chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In an experimental autoimmune enceph-alomyelitis model, we found that TnP controls neuroinflammation and prevents demyelination due to its capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and to act in the central nervous system blocking the migration of inflammatory cells responsible for neuronal degeneration. Therefore, the identification of potential targets for TnP is the objective of this research. In this study, we used bioinformatics and computational approaches, as well as bioactivity databases, to evaluate TnP-target prediction for proteins that were not experimentally tested, specifically predicting the 3D structure of TnP and its biochemical characteristics, TnP-target protein binding and docking properties, and dynamics of TnP competition for the protein/receptor complex interaction, construction of a network of con-nectivity and interactions between molecules as a result of TnP blockade, and analysis of similarities with bioactive molecules. Based on our results, integrins were identified as important key proteins and considered responsible to regulate TnP-governed pharmacological effects. This comprehensive in silico study will help to understand how TnP induces its anti-inflammatory effects and will also facilitate the identification of possible side effects, as it shows its link with multiple biologically important targets in humans.",2022,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Antidiarrheal Effect of Sechang-Zhixie-San on Acute Diarrhea Mice and Network Pharmacology Deciphering Its Characteristics and Potential Mechanisms,; CELLS; TRANSPORT; UPDATE,"Sechang-Zhixie-San (SCZX) is an ancient prescription used for pediatric diarrhea by the Yi people in China, which consists of Rodgersia sambucifolia Hemsley (known as Yantuo and abbreviated as YT) and Bentonite (BN). Now, it is also a Chinese patent medicine used in the clinic to treat infantile diarrhea. Besides evaluating the antidiarrheal effect of SCZX on diarrhea mice induced by Folium Sennae, the purpose of this study is to outline the characteristics of the antidiarrheal effect and reveal the potential mechanisms of SCZX through the analysis of the mechanism and active components of YT via network pharmacology and molecular docking, combined with the research progress of BN obtained from the literature. SCZX (3.12 and 12.48 g/kg) effectively inhibited diarrhea in mice, significantly lowering the loose stool rate (LSR), loose stool level (LSL), and loose stool index (LSI). Using network pharmacology, the herb-compound-target-pathway-pharmacological action network was mapped to indicate the antidiarrheal mechanism of YT. And the docking results revealed that 4 components of YT including quercetin, geranyl-1-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1 x27f6; 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 3 alpha-O-(E)-p-hydroxy-cinnamoyl-olean-12-en-27-oic acid, and daucosterol showed significant docking activities with STAT3, EGFR, and SLC10A2, involving 11 pathways such as Th17 cell differentiation, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. According to our research results and literature reports, the antidiarrheal could be summarized into five aspects: inhibiting intestinal inflammation, acting as a barrier to the intestinal mucosal, regulating water and ion transport, involving the purification of intestinal microorganisms, and intestinal transmission, which might be dependent on multiple proteins and intervention in multiple pathways.",2020,Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1

Aims and Objectives: to describe and understand how nurses perceive gender-based violence in health care for women victims of gender-based violence. Qualitative descriptive study. The recommendations of the COREQ guide for qualitative research reporting were followed. Sixteen nurses who were working in different health services, both primary and specialized care, were selected to take part in the study. Three focus groups and a semi-structured interview were conducted. The ATLAS.ti 9 computer programme was used. The nurses highlighted that when caring for women who are victims of gender violence, they encounter two types of violence: invisible or latent, and visible or patent. Part of the nurses' role is based on the skill of knowing how to act and being trained to do so. In addition, there are certain controversies around the concept and origin of violence. On the one hand, they refer to gender violence as a universal phenomenon with strong cultural and educational roots, and, on the other hand, it is difficult to characterize. The findings report how nurses play a fundamental role in caring for victims of gender-based violence, but they encounter certain difficulties regarding this concept. It is therefore essential to continuously train and educate nurses on gender-based violence. Gender violence should be a competency in nursing curricula. Health systems must offer training and awareness programmes that teach nurses to detect and make decisions regarding female victims of gender violence. It is also necessary to set up spaces in the different services so that the nurses can attend to the victims.",2022,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1

China is a major destination country for illegal wildlife trade and Guangdong Province is one of the areas of high domestic wildlife consumption. A willingness to consume lies at the root of the illegal wildlife trade. To understand the ideological roots of pangolin consumption, and to propose solutions, we conducted a consumption survey in 21 prefecture-level cities in Guangdong and have collected 1,957 valid questionnaires. In these questionnaires, 108 respondents (5.52%) who had consumed pangolin-related products, scales had been consumed by 61 respondents (3.12%), 58 respondents (2.96%) had consumed meat. We found that scale consumption was primarily motivated by disease treatment (80.43%). The main reason for meat consumption was accidental (44.83%), but among those who intentionally ate pangolin were motivated by curiosity (22.41%) or showing off (8.62%). Simultaneously, the respondents' future consumption willingness for medicinal purposes was more difficult to change than its use for other purposes. What's more, the public's insufficient understanding of the status of pangolins in China and weak legal awareness were potential reasons for pangolin consumption. In addition to classifying pangolins as Category I state-protected animals in China and strengthening penalties and enforcement, we recommend creating public awareness of the risk of zoonotic diseases, advocating for the use of alternative medicines in disease treatment and removing scales from ingredients in patented medicines, which will all act to reduce the demand for pangolins. We expect these actions to change public consumption behaviors and their collective understanding of pangolins, which improve pangolin protection efforts around the globe.",2020,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

This is patent in the subfamily Stenodermatinae, where many species build tents with plant leaves for communal roosting at daytime. On the basis that tents offer rich light conditions by partly allowing sunlight to pass through the leaves and this makes that yellow coloration probably provides camouflage benefits to tent-roosting bats, that gregariousness facilitates visual communication, and that all Stenodermatinae bats possess retinal L-cones that allow the perception of long-wavelength light and have a frugivorous diet from which carotenoids are obtained, we hypothesized that tent-roosting may have driven the evolution of yellow skin coloration in this group of bats. We tested this prediction in 71 species within Stenodermatinae. Reconstructions of ancestral states showed that the common ancestor was most likely not colorful and did not roost in tents, but both traits early appeared in the first phylogenetic ramification. Phylogenetically controlled analyses showed that, as predicted, yellow skin coloration and tent-roosting coevolved after their appearance. This is the first explanation for the evolution of body coloration in nocturnal mammals. As the light environment of nocturnal forests is dominated by yellow-green wavelengths that coincide with the spectral sensitivity of some bats, nocturnal light conditions may have acted jointly with diurnal light conditions in tents to favor the evolution of yellow skin coloration in these animals.",2020,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,1

In fact, monocytes from filariae-infected individuals demonstrate internalized filarial antigens and, as a consequence, express inhibitory surface molecules and have diminished cytokine production. To investigate the mechanisms underlying monocyte dysfunction in filarial infections, purified human monocytes were exposed to live microfilariae (mf) of Brugia malayi, and the mRNA and protein expression of important inhibitory and/or autophagy-related molecules were assessed. Our data indicate that mf-induced autophagy in human monocytes shown by the formation of autophagic vesicles, by the upregulation in the mRNA expression of autophagy-related genes BCN1, LC3B, ATG5, ATG7 (P < 0.05), and by increase in the levels of LC3B protein. Furthermore, this mf-induced autophagy increased the levels of monocyte CD206 expression. In addition, mf significantly induced the frequency of interferon (IFN)-gamma(+) human monocytes and at the same time induced the mRNA expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) through an IFN-gamma-dependent mechanism; significantly enhanced tryptophan degradation (an indicator of IDO activity; P < 0.005). Interestingly, this autophagy induction by mf in monocytes was IFN-gamma-dependent but IDO-independent as was reversed by anti-IFN-gamma but not by an IDO inhibitor. Our data collectively suggest that mf of Brugia malayi regulate the function of monocytes by induction of IDO and IFN , induce autophagy through an IFN-gamma-dependent mechanism, and increase M2 phenotype through induction of autophagy; all acting in concert to drive monocyte dysfunction.",2022,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Tropical Medicine",1
'Superimposed miracles': an extremely rare case of a septuagenarian with an unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot: a case report,Tetralogy of Fallot; Haemodynamic balance; Longevity; Natural history; Miracles; Case report; ,"Background Although the life expectancy of patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is comparable to that of the general population due to advancements in surgical intervention, if untreated, patients with TOF may die during their childhood. However, it has been anecdotally reported that a small number of patients with unrepaired TOF survived into their senescence. Case summary A 71-year-old man with a history of multiple heart failure admissions was referred to our institute after successful cardiopulmonary arrest resuscitation. Transthoracic echocardiography showed the overriding of the aorta on a large ventricular septal defect and right ventricular hypertrophy, along with severe pulmonary stenosis (PS), all of which indicated unrepaired TOF. Computed tomography revealed a patent Blalock-Taussig shunt, which was constructed at the age of 19 years. Coronary angiography revealed multivessel coronary stenoses. Although radical intracardiac repair was not performed due to his multiple comorbidities, his heart failure symptoms were significantly improved owing to proper medication titration. One year following discharge, the patient was well and enjoyed playing golf. Discussion Specific anatomical, functional, and haemodynamic characteristics may be required for the long-term survival of patients with TOF. Pulmonary stenosis should be initially mild to guarantee pulmonary flow during childhood and adolescence, and gradual PS exacerbation should be paralleled with systemic-to-pulmonary collateral development or an extracardiac shunt. Moreover, reduced left ventricular compliance may act as a balancing factor against a right-to-left shunt. The presence of all of these special requirements may have contributed to the unusual survival for this patient.",2021,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,1

Lianhua Qingwen capsule (LQC) has shown therapeutic effects in patients with COVID-19. This study is aimed to discover its molecular mechanism and provide potential drug targets. Materials and Methods An LQC target and COVID-19-related gene set was established using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database and seven disease-gene databases. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed to discover the potential mechanism. Molecular docking was performed to visualize the patterns of interactions between the effective molecule and targeted protein. Results A gene set of 65 genes was generated. We then constructed a compound-target network that contained 234 nodes of active compounds and 916 edges of compound-target pairs. The GO and KEGG indicated that LQC can act by regulating immune response, apoptosis and virus infection. PPI network and subnetworks identified nine hub genes. The molecular docking was conducted on the most significant gene Akt1, which is involved in lung injury, lung fibrogenesis and virus infection. Six active compounds of LQC can enter the active pocket of Akt1, namely beta-carotene, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin, quercetin and wogonin, thereby exerting potential therapeutic effects in COVID-19. Conclusions The network pharmacological strategy integrates molecular docking to unravel the molecular mechanism of LQC. Akt1 is a promising drug target to reduce tissue damage and help eliminate virus infection.",2020,Cell Biology,1

It particularly focuses on environmental regulations and industrial pollution intensity as the key moderating mechanisms. We develop hypotheses by combining economic rationality of natural-resource-based view and institutional rationality of institution-based view. Our theoretical discussions highlight the importance of the intersection between the two theories in explaining the eco-innovation effects of foreign ownership and FDI spillovers, and in particular in allowing a nuanced consideration around the under-explored boundary conditions of FDI effects in the eco-innovation domain. Using the propensity score matching method to match domestically owned enterprises (DOEs) with foreign MNE-invested enterprises (FIEs) in China during the period of 2001-2013, we find clear evidence that FIEs outperform their domestic counterparts of similar characteristics in conducting eco-innovation. This superior performance is particularly pronounced in cities with higher levels of environmental regulation and industries with higher levels of pollution. Furthermore, we assess the local impact of MNEs on eco-innovation of DOEs and find evidence that the presence of FDI, in particular, that within cities, leads to increased eco-innovation in DOEs. FIEs' eco-innovation spillover effects within a city are conditional on environmental regulation and pollution intensity. Thus, in China, MNEs are found to act as agents of change who not only conduct eco-innovation in the host country but also stimulate the eco-innovation of DOEs.",2023,Business & Economics; Engineering,1

Because of the complexity of the chemical constituents of Chinese herbal formulas, the holistic pharmacological mechanism of FTZ acting on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. Aim of the study: To investigate the pharmacological efficacy and mechanism of FTZ in the treatment of T2DM accompanied by NAFLD. Materials and methods: Network pharmacology and validation in minipigs were used in this study. First, potential bioactive compounds of FTZ were identified by the traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology technology platform (TCMSP). Then, targets of compounds were gathered using DrugBank, SwissTargetPrediction and TCMSP, while targets for T2DM and NAFLD were collected from CTD (compounds-targets-diseases network) and GeneCards. Common targets were defined as direct therapeutic targets acting on T2DM with NAFLD. In addition, crucial targets were chosen by the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and contribution to compound-therapeutic targets in T2DM with the NAFLD network. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to analyze the metabolism-related signaling pathways affected by FTZ. Candidate patterns selected by network pharmacology were tested in the minipigs model of T2DM with NAFLD. Measurements of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting insulin (FINS) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the blood and the expression levels of proteins, including PI3K-AKT and HIF-1?, in the livers of the minipigs were followed by the administration of FTZ. Results: A total of 116 active compounds and 82 potential targets related to T2DM and NAFLD were found. Pathway and functional enrichment analysis showed that FTZ mainly regulates metabolism-related pathways, including PI3K-AKT, HIF-1?, TNF? and MAPK. Animal experiments showed that FTZ treatment significantly reduced the serum levels of TG, TC, LDL-C and FBG, increased serum levels of HDL-C, ameliorated systemic insulin resistance (IR), and attenuated liver damage in minipigs with T2DM and NAFLD.

Multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Zedoary Turmeric Oil Injection against lipopolysaccharides-induced acute lung injury in rats elucidated by network pharmacology combined with transcriptomics,Acute lung injury; Traditional Chinese medicine; Zedoary turmeric oil injection; Network pharmacology; INNATE; RECOGNITION; APOPTOSIS; GROWTH,"Background: Prospects for the drug treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) is unpromising. Managing inflammation can prevent ALI from progressing and minimize further deterioration. Zedoary turmeric oil injection (ZTOI), a patented traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has been used against ALI, has shown significant anti-inflammatory effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Purpose: Elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism by which ZTOI acts against ALI in rats using an ingredientstargets-pathways (I-T-P) interaction network. Study design and methods: The key ingredients of ZTOI were characterized using UPLC-MS/MS combined with literature mining. The target profiles of each ingredient were established using drug-target databases. The anti-inflammatory activity of ZTOI against lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced rat ALI was validated using histopathology and inflammatory factor assessments. The therapeutic targets of ZTOI were screened by integrating transcriptomic results of lung tissues with protein-protein interaction (PPI) expansion. Using KEGG pathway enrichment, an I-T-P network was established to determine the essential interactions among ingredients, targets, and pathways of ZTOI against lung inflammation in ALI. Molecular docking and immunofluorescence staining were utilized to confirm the accuracy of the I-T-P network. Results: A total of 11 sesquiterpenes, whose target profiles may characterize the potential function of ZTOI, were identified as key ingredients. In the ALI rat model, ZTOI can alleviate lung inflammation by decreasing the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha both in serum and lung tissues. Based on our biological samples, transcriptomics, PPI network expansion, and KEGG pathway enrichment, 11 ingredients, 174 targets, and 8 signaling pathways were linked in the I-T-P networks. From these results, ZTOI could be inferred to exert multiple anti-inflammatory effects against ALI through Toll-like receptor, NF-kappa B, RIG-I-like receptor, TNF, NOD-like receptor, IL-17, MAPK, and the Toll and Imd signaling pathways. In addition, two significantly regulated targets in the transcriptome, Usp18 and Map3k7, could be the essential anti-inflammatory targets of ZTOI. Conclusion: By integrating network pharmacology with ingredient identification and transcriptomics, we show the multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms by which ZTOI acts against ALI on an I-T-P level.

The aim of this study was to assess the demand (use and/or request) for MRDT, health care-seeking behavior, and drug use, as well as associated factors, among rural community members (both children and adults) with fever or malaria-like illness in Ebonyi state, Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional household survey was conducted between October 1st and November 7th, 2018, in 18 rural geographical clusters. Data was collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was done using summary statistics. Associated factors (socio-demographic, knowledge and opinion level) were assessed using bivariate and multivariate binomial logistic regressions while the overall effects of these factors were assessed using the postestimation test command in Stata. Results A total of 1310 children under 5 years of age and 2329 children ages 5 years and above and adults (excluding pregnant women) (3639 overall) participated in the study. Among the 1310 children under 5 years of age: 521 (39.8%) received MRDT of which the caregivers of 82 (15.7%) requested for the MRDT; 931 (71.1%) sought care with public/private sector providers (excluding traditional practitioners/drug hawkers) the same/next day; 495 (37.8%) sought care at government primary health centres, 744 (56.8%) sought care with the patent medicine vendors (PMVs); 136 (10.4%) sought care with traditional practitioners; 1020 (77.9%) took ACTs (=88.2%, 1020/1156 of those who took anti-malarial drugs). Generally, lower values were respectively recorded among the 2329 children ages 5 years and above and adults (excluding pregnant women). The most important overarching predictor of the demand for MRDT and care-seeking behaviour was the knowledge and opinion level of respondent female heads of households about malaria and malaria diagnosis. Conclusions Among the rural community members with fever or malaria-like illness in Ebonyi state, Nigeria, while majority did not receive MRDT or diagnostic testing, and sought care with the PMVs, most took anti-malaria drugs, and mostly ACTs.

Our theorizing rests on the foundation that a firm's business growth stems from its breadth (or volume) of opportunities for creating added value with buyers, which more fully realizes the Penrosean vision that firm growth can be explained by a dynamic interaction between productive resources and demand-side market opportunities. Although relational embeddedness may give a supplier dyadic advantages with focal buyers, which supports business growth, we theorize that it can also lead to narrower added value business opportunities with the supplier's entire portfolio of buyers. Critically, we hypothesize that the effect of relational embeddedness on business growth is moderated by a set of relational and demand-side attributes. These hypotheses are tested on a panel data set of patent law firms (suppliers) and their relationships with corporate clients (buyers). We find that greater relational embeddedness is associated with slower supplier business growth, and consistent with our hypotheses, this negative effect is alleviated when these firms have greater cross-servicing ability and receive more relational commitment from buyers but exacerbated when suppliers hold more buyer-specific knowledge and when buyers undertake more (internal) concurrent sourcing. In turn, our research demonstrates how the attributes of a supplier's relationships with its portfolio of buyers can impact access to new business opportunities and thus opens up new directions for research on firm growth, demand-side strategy and buyer-supplier relationships.",2021,Business & Economics,1

The development of big data and its related technology supports and promotes a new round of technological innovation, making a new generation of information security technology reform and innovation, bringing opportunities and challenges to optimize, and consolidating national information security. In the era of big data, what kind of challenges and impacts will information security face? and is it crucial to explore the response strategies? At present, China has risen to become the world's largest number of Internet users and the largest number of people using smartphones, but because China's information security is the initial stage, involving information security, especially national information security laws and regulations are not much, the national social supervision and monitoring mechanisms are not much, the application level of science and technology content is relatively backward, the core technology has a patent technology not much, resulting in the flood of network data nowadays. Therefore, the underground illegal data industry chain activities are rampant. Therefore, this paper proposes a security-aware model based on the combination of distributed data analysis technology and data features.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the postgraduate students and faculty of six health-care professional institutions in Belagavi, Karnataka. A total of 724 responses were recorded using convenient sampling. Data was collected using self-administered validated questionnaire which included demographic details and total 20 questions pertaining to knowledge, awareness, and practices regarding IPR. Two-point Likert scale was used. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Chi-square test were applied. RESULTS: A total of 724 responses were recorded, 411 from postgraduate students and 313 from faculty of 6 health-care professional institutions. It was observed that 24.3% and 39.3% of postgraduate students and faculty participants, respectively, had maximum knowledge while 35.5% of faculty and 27.5% of postgraduate students had maximum awareness regarding IPR in India. Only 17.6% and 10.2% of faculty and postgraduate students had previously attended workshops on IPR. CONCLUSION: The present study identified that both faculty and postgraduate students of health-care profession have less knowledge and awareness regarding IPR. However, both knowledge and awareness regarding IPR were better among faculty when compared to postgraduate students. Thus, the academic community requires a higher level of sensitization and exposure to IPR in India.",2022,"Education & Educational Research; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
Maximizing the differentiation principle in regional IP treaties to advance food security: Limitations in West Africa's regional IP and trade regime,Africa; differentiation; ECOWAS; food security; intellectual property rights (IPRs); patents; plant Breeder's rights; sustainable development; PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION; SWAKOPMUND PROTOCOL; PROPERTY; BIODIVERSITY; FOLKLORE; RIGHTS; ARIPO; LEGAL,"In this article, I examine whether the contemporary regional intellectual property (IP) agreements negotiated by West African countries are more suitable than multilateral agreements to advance food security in the region, based on the provisions they make for applying the differentiation principle. In this paper, the term West Africa is used to designate the 15 countries that are members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the major regional organization in the area (The founding members of ECOWAS were: Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania [left 2002], Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Burkina Faso [which joined as Upper Volta]. Cape Verde joined in 1977). By reviewing relevant literature and theories, I propose that the human right to development as a differentiating paradigm may be applied in IP regulation, without compromising the requirement of non-discrimination in IP regimes. I argue that human rights linked to the food security should be differentiated from the proprietary rights granted in IP. After critical doctrinal analysis of West Africa's regional agreements related to IP rights and food security, I conclude that rather than maximising the adoption of the differentiation principle to advance the regions food security, these treaties are surprisingly less flexible than multilateral agreements, creating further challenges for food security in the region. Consequently, I propose an alternative regional framework for differentiation, that allows for differentiation between IP and human rights norms based on the instrumentalist approach to law, as being more suitable for advancing development and food security in West Africa.",2021,Government & Law,1
Old but not obsolete: Dimensional analysis in nondestructive testing and evaluation,Dimensional analysis; Buckingham's pi theorem; Non-destructive testing & evaluation (NDT&E); Eddy current testing (ECT); Multi-parameter simultaneous estimation; Thickness estimation; Electrical conductivity estimation; THICKNESS MEASUREMENT; CONDUCTIVITY,"This paper proposes dimensional analysis for solving Non-Destructive Testing & Evaluation (NDT&E) problems. This is the first time that this approach has been adopted in the framework of NDT&E, and the paper ushers in the development of probes and methods for simultaneously estimating several parameters with a simple approach. The most important theorem of dimensional analysis is Buckingham's pi theorem, based on the concept that the laws of the physics do not depend on the particular set of units chosen. At the core of this theorem is a systematic reduction in the number of variables describing a physical problem. This reduction is equal to k, the number of fundamental dimensions required to describe the variables of the physical problem in its original setting. This makes the approach ideal when the number of variables in the physical problem is not much greater than k. In this paper, we demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in the simple problem of simultaneously estimating the thickness and electrical conductivity of a conducting plate, via Eddy Current Testing. The approach is original, effective, efficient, and currently patent-pending. All the aspects, from theory to experimental validation, are provided, and it is proved that the proposed method achieves a very good degree of accuracy over a wide range of thicknesses and electrical conductivities. Moreover, the proposed method is compatible with the in-line and real -time estimation of thickness and electrical conductivity in an industrial environment.",2024,Materials Science,1
What Factors are Driving R&D in the Pharmaceutical Industry in India? A Study of the Post-Liberalization Period,Pharmaceutical companies; Innovation; India; Determinants of R&D; Bivariate probit; Dynamic panel data; MARKET-STRUCTURE; CASH FLOW; FIRM SIZE; INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS; INVESTMENT; EXPORTS; EQUITY,"There exist a significant number of studies to find the fundamental factors driving R&D in the Indian pharmaceutical industry. Firm size, firm age, export orientation, profits are some important determinants of pharma R&D found by earlier researchers. After liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991 and change in the Patent law as per WTO requirements in 1995, the determining factors of R&D in the pharmaceutical sector are expected to change significantly. This study intends to find the significant factors influencing the R&D status and the intensity of R&D expenditures in the subsequent period, in the framework of bivariate probit model and dynamic panel data model respectively. This study is based on an unbalanced panel of 150 listed firms covering the period 1995-2019. Unlike the earlier studies, market share and import intensity of capital goods have emerged as important factors driving innovation in the pharmaceutical industry in the post-liberalization period along with firm size and export intensity. Moreover, we observe that, both R&D and export are persistent activity and cross-persistence in R&D and export activity is there for full sample firms, large firms and mature firms. Important policy implications that emerge from this study are that the government should promote export of pharmaceutical products, liberalize import of capital goods for this sector and increased competition between firms has a hindering effect on R&D investment in the Indian pharmaceutical industry.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Study of a common control strategy for grid-connected shunt active photovoltaic filter without DC/DC converter,"Shunt active filters; Photovoltaic generators; Power quality; Harmonics, maximum power point tracking algorithm; Simscape-Electrical matlab simulation; Case study; SYSTEM; MPPT","This paper partially validates a published patent. A common control strategy for grid-connected three-phase three-wire shunt active filter with photovoltaic generator, without DC/DC converter, that compensates the electrical grids perturbations (harmonics, reactive power, unbalanced currents, etc.) is studied. The maximum power of the photovoltaic generator is generated and fed to the grid/loads. In the proposed common control strategy, with an advanced phase locked loop, an extended instantaneous real and imaginary powers method is proposed to identify, jointly or individually, all current perturbations, as well as the current at maximum photovoltaic power in phase with the grid fundamental voltage. Furthermore, the DC voltage control loop is the maximum power-based, unlike the conventional control loop that is based on the maximum current, which allows easier integration of the maximum photovoltaic power into the extended instantaneous powers algorithm. Besides, the current control law is implemented in a single control loop only that simplifies the design. In this work, with the absence of the DC/DC converter, which makes the overall structure more reliable and economical, the output of the adapted perturb & observe algorithm is the voltage at maximum power. Finally, the studied structure is validated via real textile factory case study while using the experimental real measurements provided by power quality analysers. Indeed, under the new modelling strategy of 97% accuracy, the maximum photovoltaic current is injected while ensuring a unity power factor, balanced current with 0.16% of unbalance factor, as well as almost 1% total harmonic distortion of current at the grid side.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,1
Knowledge percolation threshold and optimization strategies of the combinatorial network for complex innovation in the digital economy,Knowledge production; Knowledge percolation threshold; Combinatorial network; Optimization strategies; Knowledge transmission; Connectivity; AGENT-BASED MODELS; COLLABORATION; ORGANIZATION; TRANSITIONS; HIERARCHY; DESIGN; NODES,"Digital economy expands the source of knowledge for innovation and accelerates the flow and combination of knowledge to form novel knowledge combinations, thereby generating the interdisciplinary knowledge production model. In this context, complex innovation which is characterized by the knowledge production consequence based on the combinations of multiple-field knowledge has become the new way for firms to seize new development opportunities and compete in the digital economy. Given that complex innovation emerged from a gradually forming large, multilayered, combinatorial network consists of collaboration networks in various knowledge fields that are initially separated, the challenge of facillatating the emergence of complex innovation is unveiling the minimum proportion of connected paths in the combinatorial network to trigger effective transmission of multi-fields knowledge and offering applicable optimization strategies to optimize that proportion. This study incorporated Ohm's law into the percolation theoretical framework and calculate the knowledge percolation threshold of the combinatorial network and its subnetworks with patent data of Chinese strategic emerging industries. We further examined the optimization results of six strategies in terms of their optimization effects and time costs. Accordingly, we revealed the probability of knowledge percolation occurring in a combinatorial network and its subnetworks, clarified knowledge transmission characteristics according to knowledge-based cluster dynamics, and determined strategies for optimizing the knowledge percolation threshold. This study is not only highly feasible and exercisable for academics to conduct future studies, but it also has vital implications for the practitioners to utilize and control the knowledge transmission of the combinatorial network to realize the complex innovation.

They undergo sol-gel transition when a critical temperature is reached, thus modifying their properties (e.g., physicochemical and mechanical) in response to temperature changes. This behavior is particularly attractive when the body temperature acts as a trigger to modulate the thermo-responsive behavior of MC hydrogels. In this regard, exciting advances have been achieved in the field of cell and drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine, making MC a very attractive and versatile biomaterial. This review aims to present MC hydrogels, examining their preparation, physical properties, and tunability of thermal response, lastly moving to a comprehensive depiction of both their conventional and innovative applications for tissue regeneration purposes. In particular, three main families of applications are introduced: (1) in situ gelling systems, which undergo sol-gel transition upon delivery into a target site (e.g., tissue or organ), assisting the regeneration of the latter both in the presence or absence of loading components (e.g., cells, biomolecules, and inorganic materials); (2) three-dimensional (3D) (bio)printing, where the sol-gel transition is induced by heating MC-based (bio)inks after printing, obtaining 3D tissue-engineered substitutes with defined geometries and high shape fidelity; (3) smart culture surfaces, where the hydrophilic/hydrophobic transition of MC is exploited to reach a selective attachment/detachment of cells, offering the possibility to obtain cell sheets and cell bodies for tissue reconstruction without the need of any proteolytic enzyme. The main limitations of MC hydrogels will be then examined, together with current solutions to overcome them. Moreover, an overview of the future directions in the field of MC smart hydrogels will be given, with particular focus on the design of multiresponsive systems capable to respond to multiple stimuli (e.g., chemical and biological stimuli), toward the development of more patient-specific treatments. Finally, an overview of the patents and clinical trials describing the use of MC will be given, retracing the abovementioned families of application. Impact statement We present thermo-responsive methylcellulose (MC) hydrogels, unveiling the role of their optimal design as the key strategy to tailor their smart response. The central focus of this work is MC smart behavior, which is pivotal both when MC is used alone or combined with other polymers for tissue regeneration purposes. We systematically review the current trends in MC applications, classifying them in three main families: (1) in situ gelling systems, (2) three-dimensional (bio)printing, and (3) smart culture surfaces. Advantages/limitations of MC hydrogels are shown, together with future directions in the field and an overview of the patents and clinical trials.",2021,Cell Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering; Materials Science,1
Can environmental protection tax force enterprises to improve green technology innovation?,Environmental protection tax; Corporate green technology innovation; R&D investment; Innovative human capital; Financing constraints; ,"The introduction of an environmental protection tax enables a smooth shift from the sewerage charge system to the environmental protection tax scheme. This, in turn, promotes a more sustainable development of enterprise growth, emphasizing eco-friendliness. This is of immense importance in advancing environmentally aware practices and sustainability. Based on data collected from A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2014 to 2021, this paper investigates the influence of environmental protection taxes on the advancement of green technology and the underlying mechanisms. Taking the execution of the Environmental Protection Tax Law in 2018 as a quasi-natural experiment, a double-difference model is employed to examine the causal relationship between environmental protection taxes and the adoption of green technology by companies. The findings indicate that the introduction of an environmental tax could markedly enhance the extent of green technological innovation within corporations. The evidence arising from the testing mechanism implies that such a tax can encourage firms to boost their investments in research and development, upgrade their innovative human capital, and mitigate financing limitations. The study found that there is heterogeneity in the promotion effect of the environmental protection tax on the green technological innovation of businesses in different regions and provinces with varying tax burdens and types of equity capital. Further research shows that the environmental protection tax has a greater impact on the promotion of utility model patent applications for green technology innovation. This paper presents empirical evidence to support further enhancement of the environmental protection tax system. It recommends designing the environmental protection tax policy with consideration for enterprises and local conditions and bolstering the system's capacity for guiding and stimulating enterprises' green development.",2024,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1

In-silico generation of random bit streams,Random number generation; Silicon Photomultipliers; Cryptography; ,"Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPM) are rapidly approaching a significant maturity stage, making them a well recognised platform for the development of evolutionary and novel solutions in a wide range of applications for research and industry. However, they are still affected by stochastic terms, notably a high Dark Count Rate (DCR), limiting their use when single photo-electron pulses convey the required information, for instance in chemiluminescence or fluorescence analysis of biological samples. In such applications, randomness of the spontaneous generation of carriers triggering the avalanche and the rate of occurrences is significantly decreasing the sensitivity of the system against solutions based, for instance, on traditional photo-multiplier tubes. However, unpredictability of the dark pulses has a potential value in domains connected to encryption and, in general terms, cybersecurity. Random Power' is a project approved within the ATTRACT call for proposals (https://attract-eu.com), having as a main goal the generation of random bit streams by properly analysing the time sequence of the Dark Pulses. The principle has been proven using laboratory equipment and its value assessed applying the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) protocols, complemented by other test suites. The advantages against competing techniques have been thoroughly analysed and the development of a dedicated board, integrating the system in a low cost, low power, scalable design is on-going.

Negotiating the Intellectual Property Protocol under the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area: Priorities and Opportunities for Nigeria,AfCFTA agreement; IPRs; trade; Nigeria; access to medicines; ,"Early March 2021, following its ratification of the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA agreement), Nigeria's National Office of Trade launched a consultative process into issues constituting the country's priorities as it prepares to participate in the negotiation of the AfCFTA agreement's protocol on intellectual property rights (IPRs). We contributed a position paper to that process, with a focus on key policy considerations that should form Nigeria's negotiation priorities on IPRs. This article describes some of the most important points of our submission and concludes by stressing that the broad policy focus should be to champion initiatives that promote Nigeria's national interest and, at the same time, recognize and accommodate the ideals of inclusiveness, openness, and collaboration within the context of the AfCFTA. In this regard, the paper recommends that Nigeria should prioritize negotiations in recognition of her strongest economic assets in copyright-related sectors and focus on institutional capacity-building for its patent and technology transfer offices so that Nigeria can effectively take advantage of the relevant Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights flexibilities locally. Nigeria can learn from South Africa in domesticating the appropriate legal framework for benefit sharing and the general protection of traditional knowledge and genetic resources. The Swakopmund Protocol on the Protection of Traditional Knowledge and Expressions of Folklore 2010, the Arusha Protocol for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 2015, and the African Union model law for the protection of the rights of local communities, farmers, breeders, and for the regulation of access to biological resources offer relevant guidance.",2022,Government & Law,1

There is little information on canine hookworm species and their public health significance in sub-Saharan Africa. This study determined the prevalence and species of hookworms in dogs from different climatic zones of Kenya. Dog faecal samples were collected from the environment, and hookworm eggs were isolated by zinc chloride flotation and subjected to DNA extraction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNA of Ancylostoma spp. and Uncinaria stenocephala were performed, and hookworm species were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or DNA sequencing. Hookworm eggs were detected by microscopy in 490/1621 (30.23%, 95% CI 28.01-32.54) faecal samples. Estimates of faecal prevalence were high in counties receiving higher rainfall (Narok 46.80%, Meru 44.88%) and low in those with a more arid climate (Isiolo 19.73%, Turkana 11.83%). In a subset of 70 faecal samples, Ancylostoma caninum (n = 59) was the most common species, followed by A. braziliense (n = 10) and A. cf. duodenale (n = 1). This study reports for the first time the detection of A. cf. duodenale in dog faeces and zoonotic hookworm species in Kenyan dogs. These findings emphasize the need for control measures such as enforcing laws for restraining stray dogs, regular deworming of dogs, and public health awareness programmes aimed at informing communities on outdoor use of footwear.",2020,Parasitology; Zoology,1
Evolution through intellectual property rights in the aquaculture sector: reshaping aquaculture production networks,Intellectual property; Aquaculture industry; Intellectual capital; Blue sustainability; Market size; UNIT-ROOT TESTS; OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; PANEL; COINTEGRATION; POWER,"In aquaculture, the intellectual property issues are the risks to the stability of copyright, trademark, patent, and other domains of intellectual property rights. As a basis of the intellectual property of marine law in the European Union region (EU27), the interests and needs of creators and the public are in balance. When such a balance is not upheld, then there is a compromise of the protection of intellectual property rights. Thus, the novelty can be formulated as follows: The analysis of the impact of the intellectual property factors on the aquaculture industry growth in the EU13 and EU14 during the 1990-2023 period. The main findings were estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), two-stage least squares (2SLS) and robust least square (RLS) to overcome the endogeneity problem. The degree of the impact reveals that the protection of IPRs and ICRs, that is, intellectual property rights and intellectual capital rights, significantly influence the growth of the aquaculture industry in the EU14 developed countries rather than in the EU13 developing countries. However, the actual values of the three estimators reveal that economic growth, market size, and governance significantly affect the aquaculture industry growth in EU13 developing countries than in EU14 developed countries. Therefore, according to the conclusions of this research, the policies that should be prioritized by the policymakers in EU13 developing countries are those that focus on the improvement of the development of intellectual property rights and intellectual capital rights plays. As it is suggested in this research, it is recommended that policymakers in EU14 developed countries enhance the blue governance, marine market size, and the development of aquatic economy and blue farming.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Case Study: Qatar,; ,"Qatar is entirely different from the benchmark countries in terms of its geography, climate, size, mix of population, culture and thus, economic conditions. It is located on the tiny branch out of the Arabian Peninsula in the eastern side of the Arabian Gulf. It is smaller than the size of state of Connecticut with around only 12,000 km(2) of pretty flat and sandy land. The country is considered quite young as it gained its independence in 1971, with small and homogenous native population (i.e., estimated to be around 300,000) as a minority among its quite internationalized total population of around 2.75 million as of 2018. It is almost entirely economically dependent on its abundant oil and gas reserves (i.e., third largest natural gas reserves in the world). The leadership of the country has taken many steps in the past two decades to attempt to transform the hydrocarbon-based economy to knowledge-based economy. The most prominent step among these is the introduction of Qatar National Vision 2030, which sets out the roadmap of economic transformation and human development in Qatar while protecting its physical, natural and cultural environment. In addition, Qatar Foundation (QF), an initiative of the Royal Family, has been phenomenal in Qatar's effort to develop a knowledge ecosystem. At the same time, enacting the law of `Protection of Intellectual Property and Copyright', 'Establishing Free Zone', and `Patents Law' has clearly demonstrated the intentions and determination of the leadership towards a knowledge-based sustainable development. Furthermore, under the umbrella of QF, Qatar is home to eight international branch campuses which help the country in exploiting its local talent on one hand and attracting the foreign talent on the other. Moreover, Qatar has two national universities and three national research institutions operating in proximity of the international branch campuses, science park, and incubation center. The location of knowledge-intensive institutions in close vicinity in the Education City, which is home to the QF and its member institutes and branch campuses, allow these institutions to collaborate and compete at the same time. Other notable institutions playing key roles in the national innovation system are Qatar Development Bank (QDB), Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP), and the recently established Qatar Research Development Innovation (QRDI) council which offer various necessary funding and support programs to lift the innovational and technological quotient of the country to international standards.",2020,Business & Economics; International Relations; Operations Research & Management Science,1
Three Ritual Steps between India and Iran,numerology; three; Visnu; Vamana; svayamatrnna; daena; Yima; cinuuato p partial derivative r partial derivative tu; vara; barsnumgah; ,"The use of triadic patterns is a well-known modality occurring in some Indo-Iranian mythological contexts. This fact has been considered as a phenomenon too generic, and its presence just noted as an unimportant evidence. But, in reality, this procedure, despite its potentially perplexing background, produces some symbolic implications, whose frequent occurrence should be better observed. For instance, within the Vedic and Brahmanic framework, Visnu makes three steps in order to enlarge the universal space, and for this reason this god is also called Trivikrama-, Having Three Steps. The present sequence, with its space-time implications, finds a correspondence in the disposition of the Vedic altar of Fire, which needs three footsteps of ground. Even more fitting and pertinent are the inevitable speculations emerging from the ritual meaning of the pebbles or stones called svayamatrnna, naturally perforated, placed by the Adhvaryu in the first, third and fifth layer of the brick-altar of the Agnicayana. They have a patent cosmological identity (see, e.g., sb 8.7.3.9-10). Within the Iranian context, references to the number three are equally relevant and not just meaningless. Three are the main steps of the soul of the dead after their meeting with the daena-, explicitly corresponding to three different cosmic levels, while the vara- of Yima, and the barsnumgah, a place of ritual purification, are divided in three parts, and in any case everything connected with them follows a triadic basis with multiples or submultiples of three, or again with fractions with an expressed denominator three. The act of piling up the perforated stones on the three layers of the Vedic fire altar presents deep cosmological implications, strictly connected also with the holes through which an imaginary column arises. The act of piling up (cinute) resounds the action to be performed by the soul in the Mazdean choreography of the afterlife, when the bridge (p partial derivative r partial derivative tu-) allowing the crossing of the intermediate space (that links earth and heaven) is piled up (by one who is cinuuat-, presumably the soul itself). But piling the bricks and tending the fire are ritual performative actions expressed with the same verb and with actions, which inevitably resonate, as in the image of the third prince appearing within the afterlife choreography presented as a vision to the Sasanian Great Priest Kerdir. These occurrences, already focused on in past studies, evoke direct correspondences in ritual procedures emphasizing a definitive transition into another status, so that any triplication or any trifold implement has a special force and completeness.",2023,History,1

It was therefore important to study Northern New South Wales (NNSW) where cannabis use is high. Methods Design: Cohort. 2008-2015. Setting: NNSW and Queensland (QLD), Australia. Participants. Whole populations. Exposures. Tobacco, alcohol, cannabis. Source: National Drug Strategy Household Surveys 2010, 2013. Main Outcomes. CA Rates. NNSW-QLD comparisons. Geospatial and causal regression. Results Cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal anomalies rose with falling tobacco and alcohol but rising cannabis use rates across Queensland. Maternal age NNSW-QLD was not different (2008-2015: 4265/22084 v. 96,473/490514 > 35 years/total, Chi.Sq. = 1.687, P = 0.194). A higher rate of NNSW cannabis-related than cannabis-unrelated defects occurred (prevalence ratio (PR) = 2.13, 95%C.I. 1.80-2.52, P = 3.24 x 10(- 19)). CA's rose more potently with rising cannabis than with rising tobacco or alcohol use. Exomphalos and gastroschisis had the highest NNSW:QLD PR (6.29(2.94-13.48) and 5.85(3.54-9.67)) and attributable fraction in the exposed (84.11%(65.95-92.58%) and 82.91%(71.75-89.66%), P = 2.83 x 10(- 8) and P = 5.62 x 10(- 15)). In multivariable geospatial models cannabis was significantly linked with cardiovascular (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductus arteriosus), genetic (chromosomal defects, Downs syndrome), gastrointestinal (small intestinal atresia), body wall (gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia) and other (hypospadias) (AVTPCDSGDH) CA's. In linear modelling cannabis use was significantly linked with anal stenosis, congenital hydrocephalus and Turner syndrome (ACT) and was significantly linked in borderline significant models (model P < 0.1) with microtia, microphthalmia, and transposition of the great vessels. At robust and mixed effects inverse probability weighted multivariable regression cannabis was related to 18 defects. 16/17 E-Values in spatial models were > 1.25 ranging up to 5.2 x 10(13) making uncontrolled confounding unlikely. Conclusions These results suggest that population level CA's react more strongly to small rises in cannabis use than tobacco or alcohol; cardiovascular, chromosomal, body wall and gastrointestinal CA's rise significantly with small increases in cannabis use; that cannabis is a bivariate correlate of AVTPCDSGDH and ACT anomalies, is robust to adjustment for other substances; and is causal.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology,1

This research attempts to investigate the effect of five critical success factors for three centers of academic information management and evaluation in Iran as a developing country. These centers play a key role in the management and evaluation of theses, research projects, papers, and patents nationally. Semi-structured interviews, studies of literature, and providing questionnaires have been used to collect the material for the research. The research population was selected using purposive sampling and consists of managers and all the employees in the three centers who had at least a master's degree. Their viewpoints were surveyed and the data was analyzed using ANOVA, Scheffe, and Pearson's correlation test. The findings affirm that management stability makes it possible to perform long-term plans in these centers. However, independency acts as a factor to strike the balance between responsibilities and authorities, manager's speciality improves the plans and performances in a specific and professional way, information technology reduces the expenses and facilitates the presentation of faster services, and finally distance from authorities influences the speed of reporting and providing facilities. The results show each of these five factors, not only independently but also together and as a whole, affects the success of these kinds of centers. Moreover, while confirming the correlation between these factors, it was revealed which of these factors has a greater impact on their success.",2021,Information Science & Library Science,1
Potts shunt as an effective palliation for patients with end stage pulmonary arterial hypertension,Reverse Potts shunt; Right ventricular dysfunction; Bridge to transplant; ATRIAL SEPTOSTOMY; CREATION; CHILDREN; SURVIVAL; ADULT,"Background: Potts shunt has been suggested as an effective palliative therapy for patients with pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) not associated with congenital heart disease. Materials and methods: This is a prospective single-center study performed to assess outcomes of Potts shunt in patients with PAH who are in functional class III or IV. Results: 52 patients in functional class III/IV with pulmonary arterial hypertension without significant intra or extracardiac shunt on maximal medical therapy were evaluated and counseled for undergoing Potts shunt/patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stenting. 16/52 patients (13 females) consented for the procedure; 14 patients underwent surgical creation of Potts, and 2 underwent transcatheter stenting of PDA, which physiologically acted like a Potts shunt. Standard medical therapy was continued in patients who did not consent for the procedure. 12/16 patients survived the procedure. Patients who did not survive the procedure were older, with severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and functional class IV. Patients who survived the procedure were followed up in the pulmonary hypertension clinic. The Median follow-up was 17 months (1-40 months). 11/13 patients discharged after the operation showed sustained clinical, echocardiographic, and biochemical improvement, which reduced need for pulmonary vasodilator therapy in 10/13 patients. There was one death in the follow-up period 16 months post-surgery due to lower respiratory tract infection. Conclusion: Potts shunt is feasible in patients with PAH without significant intra or extracardiac shunts. It can be done safely with an acceptable success rate. Patient selection, preoperative stabilization, and meticulous postoperative management are essential. It should be performed at the earliest sign of clinical, echocardiographic, or laboratory deterioation for optimal outcomes. Long-term follow-up is required to see a sustained improvement in functional class and the need for a lung transplant in the future. (C) 2021 Cardiological Society of India.

First-in-man permanent laparoscopic fixation free obliteration of inguinal hernia defect with the 3D dynamic responsive implant ProFlor-E® Case report,Inguinal hernia repair; Laparoscopic; Fixation free hernia repair; ProFlor prosthesis; Dynamic responsivity; Regenerative scaffold; CHRONIC PAIN; REPAIR; MESH; METAANALYSIS; GUIDELINES; SOCIETY,"INTRODUCTION: In the case of inguinal hernia recurrence after primary anterior repair, international guidelines strongly suggest a posterior laparoscopic approach. The 3D dynamic-responsive prosthesis for inguinal hernia repair ProFlor-E (R) has recently been introduced to the market. The present report describes the results of the first-in-man laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair carried out with ProFlor-E. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 71-year-old male Caucasian presented with recurrent inguinal hernia after primary anterior repair. A fixation free TAPP procedure with ProFlor-E was planned. Implant delivery and placement to obliterate the defect was quick and safe. Postoperatively, starting from 2nd postop day, pain was practically absent allowing quick return to normal activities. During follow up, US and MRI scans confirmed the permanence of ProFlor-E (R) in the hernial gap. During 16-month follow-up no complications were reported. DISCUSSION: Flat meshes used to reinforce the herniated inguinal area is a well-established concept. Notwithstanding, such static and passive implants leave the defect patent and cause specific complications related to mesh fixation and uncontrolled poor quality fibrotic ingrowth. ProFlor-E (R) respects the inguinal physiology resolving these issues. Its centrifugal expansion and dynamic responsivity allows for fixation-free defect obliteration, thus avoiding complications, above all tissue tear, bleeding, mesh invagination, discomfort and chronic pain. In accord with the degenerative pathogenesis of hernia disease, by acting as a regenerative scaffold, ProFlor-E restores the inguinal barrier promoting the regeneration of the typical inguinal components. CONCLUSION: This initial experience seems to prove that ProFlor-E (R) can also be used with the laparoscopic approach achieving excellent results. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Continuing trends in US brand-name and generic drug competition,Prescription drugs; generic drugs; pharmaceutical economics; economic competition; market exclusivity; ,"Objective To provide updated evidence in a series of analyses of U.S. trends over the past two decades in key financial metrics for branded drugs: market exclusivity periods (MEPs, the time between launch and first generic entry) for new molecular entities (NMEs); the probability, timing and number of patent challenges under Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act; and the intensity of generic penetration. Methods As previously, we used IQVIA National Sales Perspectives U.S. data to calculate MEPs for the 356 NMEs experiencing initial generic entry from 1995 through 2019, the number of generic competitors for twelve months afterward (by prior sales level), and generic shares. We calculated the probability, timing and number of Paragraph IV challengers using Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) approval letters, the FDA website, public information searches, and ParagraphFour.com. Results For NMEs experiencing initial generic entry in 2017-19, the MEP was 13.0 years for drugs with sales greater than $250 million in 2008 dollars the year before generic entry (NMEs>$250 million), 14.1 years overall. One year later, brands' average unit share was 18% for NMEs>$250 million, 23% overall. Ninety-three percent of NMEs>$250 million experiencing initial generic entry faced at least one Paragraph IV challenge (2019, three-year rolling average), an average of 6.0 years after brand launch (81% and 6.3 years for all NMEs). NMEs faced an average of 6.8 and 8.9 Paragraph IV challengers per NME, for all and NMEs>$250 million, respectively (2017-19 figures). Limitations All analyses were restricted to NMEs experiencing generic entry. Conclusion The average 2017-19 MEP of 13.0 years for NMEs>$250 million has changed relatively little over the past decade and remains lower than for all NMEs (14.1 years). Paragraph IV challenges are more frequent and occur earlier for NMEs>$250 million. Generic share erosion remains high for both NME types.",2021,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine,1
A Novel Paradigm Defines Functional Molecule Clusters for an Anti-Alzheimer's Disease Recipe from Traditional Chinese Medicine,Traditional Chinese Medicine; Functional Molecule Clusters; Similarity Analysis; Multi-Target; Alzheimer's Disease; Tiaoxin Recipe; A-BETA; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ARSENIC TRIOXIDE; ROS; INFLAMMATION; CONTRIBUTES; INHIBITION,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescriptions are organically composed of compatible herbs according to the TCM theory. The complex ingredients of TCM could act on multiple targets through various pathways simultaneously to exert pharmacological effects, making TCM an unrivaled gem in the medical world. However, due to a lack of comprehensive and standard study methods, the research of TCM products has been quite limited. A novel paradigm that could aid in the discovery of the material basis and fully clarify the mechanism of TCM prescriptions is urgently needed. In this study, a similarity analysis based on molecular fingerprints was adopted to explore the representative molecules of the Tiaoxin recipe, a Chinese patent formula approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 38 out of 1047 chemicals were finally screened out. Next, we tried to define a new concept of a functional molecule cluster for chemicals with similar pharmacological effects to elucidate how the chemical mixture from TCMs produce their therapeutic effects. Four anti-AD functional molecule clusters from the Tiaoxin recipe were identified: an anti-inflammatory cluster, an anti-ROS cluster, an anti-AChE activity cluster, and an anti-A beta aggregation cluster. Furthermore, the chemicals from the anti-inflammatory cluster and anti-ROS cluster were proved to display their multi-target and multi-pathway roles partially or mainly through molecules of the TLR4-MYD88-NF-kappa B and Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathways. The functional molecule clusters may be vital to the explanation of the efficacy of the Tiaoxin recipe, which could give us a more profound understanding of TCM prescriptions. Our paradigm may open a novel path for TCM research.",2023,Integrative & Complementary Medicine; General & Internal Medicine,1
Evaluation of the mechanical properties on fracture of cement pastes with addition of graphene oxide,Cement composites; Nanomaterials; Graphene oxide; Mechanical properties; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOSHEETS; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR,"Cement-based composite materials, including cement paste, mortar and concrete, are the most commonly used materials in civil construction. However, its brittle nature, high hardness, low tensile strength and propensity to cracking are key factors that compromise durability and result in high maintenance costs for structures. Reinfor-cement materials such as steel bars, steel fibers, carbon fibers, glass fibers and polymers have been extensively applied to concrete in recent years. Although these materials can greatly improve the toughness of concrete, solving well the defects that occur in the micro scale inherent to cementitious materials, the fractures in these materials persist. Nanomaterials (such as nanosilica, carbon nanotubes and graphene derivatives) can act as a complement to traditional fibers, further reinforcing fibrous cementitious materials, through mechanisms that restrict the initiation and propagation of cracks at the nanometer scale, as well as providing an extremely high specific surface area for interaction with cement hydration products. Among the nanomaterials, graphene oxide (GO) has an enormous potential for application in cementitious composites. In this work, tests were carried out with the addition of GO produced and patented at CTNano/UFMG in cement pastes class CP-III-RS-40. The objective was to evaluate the mechanical properties of cement pastes with the addition of GO, at the levels of 0.03% and 0.05%. Among the addition levels analyzed, the content of 0.05%GO allowed to obtain the best results at 28 days of curing. Increases of 19.40%, 16.86%, 27.37% and 21.55% were obtained in the modulus of elasticity, flexural tensile strength, fracture toughness and fracture energy, respectively. In view of these results, it can be inferred that GO has the potential to be applied in civil construction, aiming the improvement of the mechanical properties and fracture parameters of cement pastes.",2022,Materials Science,1

Whether facial suture synostosis plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of these deformities is inadequately studied in human patients. Methods The MEDLINE database was queried using a methodologically generated search term inventory. Article inclusion was adjudicated by 2 authors after independent review. Articles provided insight into facial suture involvement in either syndromic craniosynostosis patients or animal models of disease. Results Comprehensive review yielded 19 relevant articles meeting inclusion criteria. Mid-20th century craniofacial biologists characterized how patent facial sutures are essential for normal postnatal facial development. They also posited that premature ossification disrupts growth vectors, causing significant dysmorphologies. Recently, facial suture synostosis was found to cause midfacial deformities independent of cranial base pathology in mouse models of syndromic craniosynostosis. Few recent studies have begun exploring facial suture involvement in patients, and although they have paved the way for future research, they bear significant limitations. Conclusions The hypothesis that facial suture synostosis acts in conjunction with cranial base pathology to produce the prominent, multifocal facial deformities in syndromic craniosynostosis may fundamentally alter surgical management and warrants further investigation. Methodically evaluating the literature, this review synthesizes all basic science and human clinical research thus far on the role of facial sutures in syndromic craniosynostosis and elucidates important topics for future research. We ultimately identify the need for rigorous imaging studies that longitudinally evaluate facial osteology across patients with various craniosynostosis syndromes.",2021,Surgery,1
"When one door closes, another door opens ... for some: Evidence from the post-TRIPS Indian pharmaceutical industry",process and product innovation; recombination; specialization; TRIPS; T-shape; ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSFORMATION; DOMINANT LOGIC; KNOWLEDGE; SPECIALIZATION; INNOVATION; PRODUCT; FIRMS; CAPABILITIES; EXPLORATION; TECHNOLOGY,"Research Summary Firms' strategy choices are contextually dependent, yet internally delimited. A radical shift in institutional context forces firms to reevaluate the desirability and suitability of current strategies and assess the potential of new strategic opportunities. From 1970 to 1995, the Indian pharmaceutical industry operated under a process-focused intellectual property regime and enjoyed legal protection to reverse engineer brand name drugs. In 1995, this protection ended with the introduction of the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) Act. We examine the innovation response of Indian pharmaceutical firms in light of this regime shift focusing on the underlying internal factors influencing firms' strategic choices. We find that the scope and balance of firms' knowledge bases, which set capabilities and influence decision framing, dictate firms' innovative response. We further document how firms' strategic choices contribute to firm financial performance and the reshaping of the Indian pharmaceutical industry. Managerial Summary From 1970 to 1995, the Indian pharmaceutical industry operated under a process-focused intellectual property regime and enjoyed legal protection to reverse engineer brand name drugs. Following TRIPS in 1995, the intellectual property regime in India became stronger, with product patent enforcement being recognized. Indian pharmaceutical firms had to make strategic choices on the kind of innovation they would pursue under this new IP regime. This article shows that having broad and nonspecialized knowledge assets allowed firms to pursue the most novel innovation and engage in new product development. Having T-shaped assets, that is, broad knowledge scope yet narrowly focused knowledge expertise, allowed firms to pursue process-based innovation in areas close to their existing areas of expertise but not necessarily engage in new product development. The findings of this article shed light on what kind of knowledge base and workforce allows firms to adjust to technological and contextual changes.",2020,Business & Economics,1
In vitro pharmacological characterization of growth hormone secretagogue receptor ligands using the dynamic mass redistribution and calcium mobilization assays,Ghrelin; Growth hormone secretagogue receptor; In vitro pharmacology; Dynamic mass redistribution; Calcium mobilization; Receptor antagonists and inverse agonists; ANOREXIA-CACHEXIA SYNDROME; GHRELIN RECEPTOR; CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY; INVERSE AGONIST; MESSENGER-RNA; LUNG-CANCER; PEPTIDE; RAT; IDENTIFICATION; ANTAGONIST,"Ghrelin modulates several biological functions via selective activation of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). GHSR agonists may be useful for the treatment of anorexia and cachexia, while antagonists and inverse agonists may represent new drugs for the treatment of metabolic and substance use disorders. Thus, the identification and pharmacodynamic characterization of new GHSR ligands is of high interest. In the present work the label-free dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) assay has been used to evaluate the pharmacological activity of a panel of GHSR ligands. This includes the endogenous peptides ghrelin, desacyl-ghrelin and LEAP2 (1-14). Among synthetic compounds, the agonists anamorelin and HM01, the antagonists HM04 and YIL-781, and the inverse agonist PF-05190457 have been tested, together with HM03, R011, and H1498 from patent literature. The DMR results have been compared to those obtained in parallel experiments with the calcium mobilization assay. Ghrelin, anamorelin, HM01, and HM03 behaved as potent full GHSR agonists. YIL-781 behaved as a partial GHSR agonist and R011 as antagonist in both the assays. LEAP2(1-14) resulted a GHSR inverse agonist in DMR but not in calcium mobilization assay. PF-05190457, HM04, and H1498 behaved as GHSR inverse agonists in DMR experiments, while they acted as antagonists in calcium mobilization studies. In conclusion, this study provided a systematic pharmacodynamic characterization of several GHSR ligands in two different pharmacological assays. It demonstrated that the DMR assay can be successfully used particularly to discriminate between antagonists and inverse agonists. This study may be useful for the selection of the most appropriate compounds to be used in future studies.",2024,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the predictive factors for ECE on computer tomography (CT) imaging for patients undergoing surgery and to analyze outcomes. Methods We conducted an Institutional Review Board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HI PAA)-compliant retrospective review of 82 patients with biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck who underwent definitive surgery without neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. CT scans were evaluated for the level of involvement, size, and presence or absence of central necrosis. Extracapsular extension in lymph nodes on the postoperative pathology was correlated with the central necrosis in the lymph nodes appreciated on the CT neck with contrast. Survival estimates were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier test. Results ECE on postoperative pathology was seen in 74.07% of patients who had evidence of central necrosis in lymph nodes on preoperative CT neck compared to 46.43% without CT necrosis (p=0.013). The incidence of ECE is higher in poorly differentiated tumors and also nodal stages >N2c at presentation. Patents with ECE had inferior disease-free and overall survival (OS). Conclusions Our results reveal that patients with necrosis on CT and with moderately to poorly differentiated tumors have a high incidence of extracapsular extension. There was no difference in local control (LC) between the groups of patients, but the OS was inferior in patients with ECE. Predicting extracapsular extension upfront helps to formulate the appropriate treatment. We propose to study additional chemotherapy to improve outcomes in patients with positive extracapsular extension.",2021,General & Internal Medicine,1
Physical-Chemical Characterization of Octreotide Encapsulated in Commercial Glucose-Star PLGA Microspheres,biodegradable microspheres; controlled-release; peptide delivery; peptide-polymer interactions; PLGA; MICROCLIMATE PH; DRUG-RELEASE; DELIVERY; WATER; ACYLATION; MICROENCAPSULATION; TRANSITION; STABILITY; KINETICS; SYSTEMS,"Sandostatin LAR (SLAR) is an injectable long-acting release (LAR) microsphere formulation for octreotide based on a biodegradeable glucose star copolymer of D,L-lactic and glycolic acids (PLGA-glu), which is primarily used for the treatment of patients with acromegaly. There currently is no generic SLAR approved in the United States despite expiration of patent coverage. To understand better this important formulation, SLAR was assessed for its composition and physical-chemical properties. Octreotide release kinetics was monitored under physiological conditions over 56 days together with several bioerosion parameters [mass loss, water uptake, pH of release media, polymer molecular weight (Mw), and confocal microscopy after BODIPY uptake]. A significant increase in the amount of released peptide occurred after day 14. After 1 day of incubation in PBST, octreotide was not extractable completely from SLAR during 2 h of the extraction process, but complete extraction was accomplished after 24 h, which suggested that strong and noncovalent PLGA-octreotide interactions occurred beginning in the initial release phase. Leuprolide is considered as a cationic peptide competitor for octreotide-PLGA interactions and its presence in the release medium resulted in more continuous octreotide release from SLAR, which was linearly correlated with the mass loss from the polymer (i.e., an indication of erosion-controlled release). These data strongly suggest that octreotide forms a salt with acid end groups of linear PLGA chains that are either present as impurities in, and/or produced by the degradation of, the PLGA-Glu. This salt is expected to catalyze octreotide acylation and extend peptide release beyond that driven by erosion control. The characterization studies of physicochemical properties of SLAR described here could be useful for the development and regulatory evaluation of generic octreotide microspheres as well as new polymer formulations, in which the polymer strongly interacts with encapsulated peptides.",2020,Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
A Design Approach to Optimise Secure Remote Three-Dimensional (3D) Printing: A Proof-of-Concept Study towards Advancement in Telemedicine,3D printing; additive manufacturing; telemedicine; patient-centric dosage form; ACCEPTABILITY; AGE,"Telemedicine is defined as the delivery of healthcare services at a distance using electronic means. The incorporation of 3D printing in the telemedicine cycle could result in pharmacists designing and manufacturing personalised medicines based on the electronic prescription received. Even with the advantages of telemedicine, numerous barriers to the uptake hinder the wider uptake. Of particular concern is the cyber risk associated with the remote digital transfer of the computeraided design (CAD) file (acting as the electronic prescription) to the 3D printer and the reproducibility of the resultant printed medicinal products. This proof-of-concept study aimed to explore the application of secure remote 3D printing of model solid dosage forms using the patented technology, DEFEND3D, which is designed to enhance cybersecurity and intellectual property (IP) protection. The size, shape, and colour of the remote 3D-printed model medicinal products were also evaluated to ensure the end-product quality was user-focused. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and poly(lactic) acid (PLA) were chosen as model polymers due to their flexibility in preventing breakage printing and ease of printing with fused deposition modelling (FDM). Our work confirmed the potential of secure remote 3D (FDM) printing of prototype solid dosage forms resulting in products with good reproducibility, resolution, and quality towards advancements in telemedicine and digital pharmacies. The limitation of the work presented here was the use of model polymers and not pharmaceutically relevant polymers. Further work could be conducted using the same designs chosen in this study with pharmaceutically relevant polymers used in hot-melt extrusion (HME) with shown suitability for FDM 3D printing. However, it should be noted that any challenges that may occur with pharmaceutically relevant polymers are likely to be related to the polymer's printability and printer choice as opposed to the ability of the CAD file to be transferred to the printer remotely.",2022,Health Care Sciences & Services,1
Discovery and Development of Pregabalin (Lyrica) The Role of Public Funding,; BAYH-DOLE ACT; DRUG,"Background and Objectives Pregabalin (Lyrica), a widely used drug that has generated billions in revenue as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy and other conditions, was originally discovered in an academic medical center, largely supported by public funding. We aimed to define the extent of direct federal public funding that contributed to various stages of pregabalin's development prior to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Methods We identified key research, scientists, and organizations involved in the development of pregabalin from its discovery through FDA approval. Using key terms (e.g., its indications and mechanism of action), we searched PubMed for relevant publications and determined whether each publication was based on federal public funding using the NIH RePORTER. For each award prior to the drug's FDA approval, we scored its potential relatedness to pregabalin's development based on its title, investigator, and organization, and then examined descriptions of the most relevant awards to aid in defining these relationships. The budgets for all related awards were converted to 2020 dollars. Results Pregabalin was discovered largely on the basis of publicly funded research at Northwestern University; in 1990, it was licensed to Parke-Davis, which further developed it through its FDA approval in 2004. Most key terms were related to the drug and drug target (n = 5) and organizations involved (n = 5), followed by patent-listed inventors (n = 3). These key terms linked 6,438 core project awards and we identified 37 NIH awards related to pregabalin's development: 9 awards through 1990 ($3.3 million) and 28 from 1991 through 2004 ($10.5 million). Conclusion Like that of many other widely sold medications, the development of pregabalin relied on public sector as well as industry contributions to its discovery, with relevant NIH awards totaling $13.8 million during its preapproval development.",2021,Neurosciences & Neurology,1
Creating Startups with NASA Technology,entrepreneurship; NASA; New Space; startups; technology transfer; ,"In contrast to the fail fast, fail often Silicon Valley paradigm, failure is not an option is an adage often observed in traditional space activities. New Space aims to reconcile both perspectives. For that to happen, innovation and risk mitigation should take place in tandem; a role that public-private partnerships can play in establishing a successful entrepreneurial space ecosystem. This is the context for the program Creating startup with NASA technology, launched by the New York Space Alliance (NYSA), in collaboration with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) through a Space Act Agreement signed in October 2018. The initiative seeks to bridge the gap between NASA and startups. It also aims to lower risks for all stakeholders involved, including the public sector, investors, entrepreneurs, and customers while fostering connections between space and nonspace businesses. The first phase focuses on transferring NASA technology to participants in a pilot program in New York. Through a series of initiatives, NYSA has been assisting startups with licensing NASA technologies for both space and nonspace commercial applications. The second phase will tap on the New York startup and innovation ecosystem to support NASA's space missions. Benefits for stakeholders involved are multiple. Impact in the city and state of New York is expected by nurturing a nascent space-based startup ecosystem, contributing to a dynamic startup community, creating both high-quality and vocational jobs, attracting and retaining talent, and stimulating economic activity, among others. In parallel, NASA engages a new innovation ecosystem and shows concrete examples of economic benefits for its research activities. The agency is also reaching a new community of entrepreneurs that will support space exploration. Entrepreneurs have access to patent-protected technologies and algorithms vetted for technical and commercial viability, as well as NASA technical personnel and facilities for additional support.",2020,Engineering,1
Does Improved Attention Induced by Caffeine Intake Affect Olfactory Function?,Caffeine; Attention; Smell; DISCRIMINATION; ADENOSINE; DRINKING; GLUCOSE; HEARING,"Objectives. Past several studies have proven that caffeine facilitates attentional enhancement by acting as an adenosine antagonist once it is absorbed by the body, resulting in improved psycho-behavioral function. Modern clinical olfactory function tests are usually assessed by psychophysical tests but due to a paucity of data, the influence of enhanced attention by caffeine on olfactory function still remains unclear. The objective of this study was to compare results of cognitive function (attention) and olfactory function before and after caffeine administration in order to analyze effects of caffeine on olfactory function in normosmic subjects. Methods. This study enrolled 49 participants of Konkuk University Hospital with a mean age of 27.7 years who had patent olfactory clefts and no olfactory dysfunction from May 2015 to February 2016. Subjects were restrained from caffeine 10 hours before the test. On day 1, participant's subjective olfactory function was evaluated before and after uptake of either caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee using visual analog scale (VAS) score, minimum cross-sectional area (MCA) measured by acoustic rhinometry, and the Korean version of Sniffin' Stick II (KVSS II). Evaluation of participant's attentional degree was measured by d2 test. On day 2, the same procedure was carried out with counterpart substance. The type of coffee initially administrated was randomly selected. Results. After administration, caffeinated coffee resulted in significant attentional enhancement than decaffeinated coffee. Results of d2 test showed statistically significant differences in the parameters of total number of errors and omission errors. In both the caffeinated and decaffeinated groups, the patients showed slight increase in VAS score and nasal cavity area; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Also, caffeinated coffee intake compared to decaffeinated coffee intake showed no significant relevance to olfactory function. Conclusion. Caffeine may significantly improve attentional congnitive function, while not have acute effects on olfactory function.",2020,Otorhinolaryngology,1
The Pharmacological Mechanism of Xiyanping Injection for the Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19): Based on Network Pharmacology Strategy,; ,"Purpose. The possible mechanism of Xiyanping injection treatment COVID-19 is discussed through the network pharmacology. Methods. Obtaining the chemical structure of Xiyanping injection through the patent application and obtaining control compounds I, II, III, IV, V, Yanhuning injection (VI, VII), Chuanhuning injection (VIII, IX), 10 compounds were analyzed by D3Targets-2019-nCoV. The human anti-COVID-19 gene in COVID-19 DisGeNET was intersected with the CTD Andrographolide target gene and then combined with D3Targets-2019-nCoV, resulting in 93 genes, using the Venny 2.1 platform. The PPI network was constructed by the String platform and Cytoscape 3.8.2 platform. The GO, KEGG, and tissue of the target were analyzed using the Metascape platform and DAVID platform. The gene expression in the respiratory system was analyzed using the ePlant platform. The CB-Dock is used for the docking verification and degree values of the first 20 genes. Results. Finally, 1599 GO and 291 KEGG results were obtained. GO is mostly associated with the cell stress response to chemicals, the cell response to oxidative stress, and the cell response to reactive oxygen species. In total, 218 KEGG pathway concentrations were related to infection and other diseases and 73 signaling pathways mostly related to inflammation and immune pathways, such as TNF signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. The molecular docking results show that Xiyanping injection, compound III, has a good docking relationship with 20 target proteins such as HSP90AA1. Tissue has 22 genes that are pooled in the lungs. Conclusion. Xiyanping injection may inhibit the release of various inflammatory factors by inhibiting intracellular pathways such as MAPK and TNF. It acts on protein targets such as HSP90AA1 and plays a potential therapeutic role in COVID-19. Thus, compound III may be treated as a potential new drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and the Xiyanping injection may treat patients with COVID-19 infection.",2022,Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1

Best, under the direction of J.J.R. Macleod, conducted the research that led to the first tests on Thompson. Significantly, it was the addition to the team of biochemist J.B. Collip and his purification of the extract that enabled the successful 23 January test. Within a day, however, tensions within the group, especially between Banting and Collip, and Collip's threat to leave and take out his own patent, prompted FitzGerald to act. On 25 January, FitzGerald finalized a seminal agreement between Connaught and Banting, Best, Collip, and Macleod that secured the further development of methods to prepare the extract on a larger scale to enable further clinical testing. From this point, Connaught would play a fundamental role in the insulin story, although its historical significance has been minimized and often misunderstood, overshadowed by the weight of the primary discovery, as well as by the critical contributions of Eli Lilly and Co. This article focuses on Connaught's intimate involvement in the history of insulin from January 1922 through the summer of 1924, tracing the challenges and innovations of developing larger-scale production methods, the establishment and expansion of Canadian insulin production capacity, and the key role the labs played in spearheading the global distribution of insulin.",2022,History & Philosophy of Science,1
Enterprise rent-seeking and high-quality development: A perspective based on institutional deficiencies,; CORRUPTION; INNOVATION; GROWTH; FIRMS; MODEL; INVESTMENT; RESOURCES; COUNTRIES; BRIBES,"Based on the puzzle of mismatch between China's current innovation environment construction and firms' innovation achievements, this paper uses data of Chinese A-share listed firms and tries to explore whether rent-seeking is a strategic choice for firms to achieve high-quality development in the context of institutional deficiencies. This paper finds that (1) corporate rent-seeking can significantly increase total factor productivity (TFP), a result that still holds after various robustness tests such as the instrumental variables method. The mechanism test finds that corporate rent-seeking can significantly incentivize corporate innovation, especially high-quality innovation. (2) Rent-seeking has a stronger effect on TFP in high-tech enterprises, patent-intensive industries, and non-overcapacity industries; institutional factors such as the reasonableness of the government-market relationship and the degree of distortion in the factor market have a significant negative and positive moderating effect on the promotion of TFP by rent-seeking, respectively. Further sub-sample tests show that the TFP promotion effect of rent-seeking in firms with stronger willingness and demand for innovation is more influenced by the institutional environment factors. The above results suggest that rent-seeking can act as an alternative means for firms to satisfy their innovation needs in the absence of institutions, and thus increase TFP. (3) Industry-based tests show that rent-seeking can promote overall technological progress, but it does not have the lubricant effect of optimizing the allocation of resources, and rent-seeking is always a suboptimal choice for the allocation of resources. Unlike previous studies that emphasized the negative consequences of rent-seeking, we highlight the potential benefits of rent-seeking in the context of China's transition economy from a total factor productivity (TFP) perspective, which enriches the research in the area of rent-seeking and TFP.",2024,Business & Economics,1
"Non-Destructive Investigation of Dispersion, Bonding, and Thermal Properties of Emerging Polymer Nanocomposites Using Close-Up Lens Assisted Infrared Thermography",graphene; composite; microscale; polymer; COMPOSITES,"Polymer nanocomposites possess unique sets of properties that make them suitable for different applications, including structural and flame-retardant material, electromagnetic wave reflector, sensors, thin film transistor, flexible display, and many more. The properties of these nanocomposite are dependent on nanofiller dispersion and bonding with polymer matrix (i.e. particle-matrix interaction). Thermography is a non-destructive method that may be used to gain insight into dispersion and particle-matrix interaction. Infrared (IR) radiation emitted from these nanomaterial polymer composite depends on the emissivity of the individual components. In addition, during flash heating and cooling, different thermal conductivity of components in the nanocomposite can influence pixel intensity differently in the IR image or video being captured. We have used an economical mid wavelength IR camera Fluke RSE600 equipped with a close-up macro lens and algorithm based on MATLAB image processing toolbox to analyse dispersion, voids and thermal diffusivity of patented graphene polymer nanocomposite materials (G-PMC) in micro-scale. These G-PMCs can act as a standard material to determine the potential of our IR thermography technique due to their homogeneity and lack of impurity due to unique fabrication process. Thermal diffusivity and dispersion of nanoparticles in our G-PMCs was estimated after irradiation with a xenon flash lamp by spatially mapping transient IR radiations from different G-PMCs using the Fluke RSE600 thermal imager. Results from thermography experiments were compared with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy results. Micro-scale thermography was able to detect millimetre scale thermal diffusivity variation in the injection molded G-PMC samples and relate it to change in dispersion of nanofillers, unlike SEM and Raman, where micro-scale measurements could not determine the reason behind millimetre scale property variation. We believe this low cost, fast, micro-scale, non-destructive technique will provide valuable insight into functional polymer nanocomposite fabrication and corresponding electrical and thermal properties.",2020,Materials Science,1
Study on incentive and supervision mechanisms of technological innovation in megaprojects based on the principal-agent theory,Technological innovation; Project management; Incentive and supervision; Megaprojects; Principal-agent theory; SUPPLY CHAIN; CONSTRUCTION; PROJECTS,"Purpose The high uncertainty of technological innovation in megaprojects brings great challenges to the R&D institution and also acts as a trigger for moral hazard. The incentive and supervision are effective means to improve the performance of innovation. The purpose of this paper is to propose appropriate incentive and supervision mechanisms to reduce information asymmetry and improve the efficiency of incentives. Suggestions on technological innovation are put forward to megaprojects management. Design/methodology/approach According to the principal-agent theory, the research develops incentive models under three states, i.e. information symmetry, information asymmetry and information asymmetry based on supervision mechanism. The Bayesian theory is employed to prove the effectiveness of the novel supervision method based on risk assessment. Findings The results indicate that under the information asymmetry, the incentive intensity is positively correlated with the social benefits coefficient, and negatively correlated with the patent benefits coefficient. The R&D effort and the owner's incentive intensity decline with the increase of information asymmetry. The supervision of risks can effectively reduce the degree of information asymmetry, and the higher the uncertainty of innovations, the more significant the effect of supervision is. As the supervision intensity increases, the incentive intensity, the R&D effort and the innovation output will increase. In addition, the R&D institutions with high innovation capability, low unit cost of R&D and low risk-aversion are more willing to make efforts to innovate. Originality/value This study fills the research gap on incentive and supervision of technological innovation in megaprojects. The externality of innovation benefits is considered in the model. The traditional incentive model is extended through the introduction of supervision. Furthermore, a novel supervision method based on risk assessment is proposed. The results validate the importance of risk management in technological innovation and provide a new insight for project management.",2021,Engineering; Business & Economics,1
Quantifying the Selective Forgetting and Integration of Ideas in Science and Technology,collective attention; collective memory; collective forgetting; mathematical modeling; computational social science; COLLECTIVE MEMORY; ATYPICAL COMBINATIONS; CUMULATIVE ADVANTAGE; PANEL-DATA; EVOLUTION; ATTENTION; MODEL; CITATIONS; DYNAMICS; STATES,"Public Significance Statement At any historical moment, many different scientific ideas are floated, tested, repudiated, repeated, and reinforced. As a society, the further we get from the birth and manipulation of an idea, the more likely we are to forget it until we reach a point where we are left only with the thoughts that we collectively decided are worth remembering. Yet, within this sheaf of ideas in time, the processes associated with ideas that have staying power remain a mystery. In this study, we statistically modeled behavioral processes of communal forgetting, filtering, and factualism using large bibliographic databases on scientific publications and technological inventions that allow us to track the referencing of ideas and technology over time. The model identifies and distinguishes rapid forgetting - ideas and technology that are forgotten after their birth even if they had initial popularity, and long-lived forgetting -- ideas and technology that slowly fade from memory. We find that collective forgetting acts like an annulment process. As information grows, forgetting rates increase despite the growing capacity to store and reference information. Further, our model of the forgetting process finds that sticky ideas and technology are selective rather than representative of the sheaf of ideas that were popular, and that the selectivity of ideas within the community of practice changes over time. How long will this article be remembered? How long will people reference it in their conversations, and for how many years will other authors cite its findings in their own works? A community's attention to a cultural object decays as time passes, a process known as collective forgetting. Recent work models this decay as the result of two different processes. One linked to communicative memory-memories sustained by human communication-and the other linked to cultural memory-memories sustained by the physical recording of content. Collective forgetting has significant impacts on communities, yet little is known about how the collective forgetting dynamic changes over time. Here, we study the temporal changes of collective memory and attention by focusing on two knowledge communities: inventors and physicists. We use data on patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and physics papers published by the American Physical Society (APS) to quantify those changes over time. The model enables us to distinguish between two branches of forgetting. One branch is short-lived, going directly from communicative memory to oblivion. The other branch is long-lived, going from communicative memory to cultural memory before going on to oblivion. The data analysis shows an increase in the forgetting rate for both communities as the amount of information in each of them grows. That growth of information forces knowledge communities to increase their selectivity regarding what is stored in their cultural memory. These findings confirm the forgetting as annulment hypothesis and show that knowledge communities can slow down collective forgetting and improve selectivity processes.",2021,Psychology,1

Nondelegation at the Founding,; ORIGINALISM,"In recent articles, a number of scholars have cast doubt on the originalist enterprise of reviving the nondelegation doctrine. In the most provocative of these, Julian Mortenson and Nicholas Bagley challenge the conventional wisdom that, as an originalist matter, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power. The question, they say, is not even close. The Founding generation recognized that power is nonexclusive, and so long as Congress did not alienate its power by giving up the ability to reclaim any exercise of power, it could delegate as broadly as it wanted to the Executive. In an article focusing on the direct-tax legislation of 1798, Nicholas Parrillo argues in this volume of the Yale Law Journal that although there may have been a nondelegation doctrine at the Founding, it appears to have allowed for broad discretion to regulate even private rights. And in a third article, Christine Kexel Chabot argues that early borrowing and patent legislation demonstrates that Congress routinely delegated important policy questions to the Executive. This Feature rebuts these challenges to a revived, more robust nondelegation doctrine. It demonstrates that there was a nondelegation doctrine at the Founding. To be sure, the history is a bit messy, precluding any kind of categorical conclusion. But when fairly evaluated, there is almost no evidence unambiguously supporting the proposition that there was no nondelegation doctrine at the Founding, while there is significant evidence that the Founding generation believed Congress could not delegate its legislative power. As for the content of that doctrine, it appears that Congress could not, and did not, delegate discretion over important subjects to the Executive. What are the important policies that must be resolved by Congress is sometimes, of course, in the eye of the beholder. But at most, debates over delegation at the Founding were lower-order disputes over application of this principle, not higher-order disputes over its validity.",2021,Government & Law,1
The endless frontier? The recent increase of R&D productivity in pharmaceuticals,R&D productivity; Pharmaceutical innovation; Attrition rates; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; INNOVATION; FAILURES; INDUSTRY; LESSONS,"Background Studies on the early 2000s documented increasing attrition rates and duration of clinical trials, leading to a representation of a productivity crisis in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). In this paper, we produce a new set of analyses for the last decade and report a recent increase of R&D productivity within the industry. Methods We use an extensive data set on the development history of more than 50,000 projects between 1990 and 2017, which we integrate with data on sales, patents, and anagraphical information on each institution involved. We devise an indicator to quantify the novelty of each project, based on its set of mechanisms of action. Results First, we investigate how R&D projects are allocated across therapeutic areas and find a polarization towards high uncertainty/high potential reward indications, with a strong focus on oncology. Second, we find that attrition rates have been decreasing at all stages of clinical research in recent years. In parallel, for each phase, we observe a significant reduction of time required to identify projects to be discontinued. Moreover, our analysis shows that more recent successful R&D projects are increasingly based on novel mechanisms of action and target novel indications, which are characterized by relatively small patient populations. Third, we find that the number of R&D projects on advanced therapies is also growing. Finally, we investigate the relative contribution to productivity variations of different types of institutions along the drug development process, with a specific focus on the distinction between the roles of Originators and Developers of R&D projects. We document that in the last decade Originator-Developer collaborations in which biotech companies act as Developers have been growing in importance. Moreover, we show that biotechnology companies have reached levels of productivity in project development that are equivalent to those of large pharmaceutical companies. Conclusions Our study reports on the state of R&D productivity in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, finding several signals of an improving performance, with R&D projects becoming more targeted and novel in terms of indications and mechanisms of action.",2020,Research & Experimental Medicine,1
Trends in the utilization of medicines sold in the private sector post- registration in South Africa and the implications for similar countries,Dispensed medicines; Marketing authorisation; Private sector; Mental Health; Retail pharmacy; Multiple sourced medicines; Single Exit Price; South Africa; SAHPRA; ,"BackgroundRegulatory authorities register medicines for patients to access them within a reasonable period of time. There is a paucity of available data regarding the extent to which registered medicines reach the public after market authorisation is granted by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA). This is important since time spent by SAHPRA assessing medicines that are subsequently not launched onto the South African market means time wasted, which could be spent on assessing new medicines that address an unmet need in the country. Consequently, we initially analysed the time taken for registered medicines to reach patients and the relationship between medicines registered at SAHPRA and those subsequently dispensed in private pharmacies. The extent of registration of multiple sourced versus new patented medicines was also explored.MethodsA retrospective, descriptive and quantitative investigation was conducted for medicines registered between 2014 and 2019. Registered and dispensed medicines were compared to establish accessibility post registration. Data sources included SAHPRA and IQVIA datasets. Microsoft Excel and SAS were used for data storage, analysis, and computation of descriptive statistical analysis.ResultsOf (N = 2175) registered medicines, only 358 (16.5%; 95% CI 15.0%-18.1%) were dispensed to patients, and out of 1735 medicines registered between 2015 and 2019, only 57 (3.3%; 95% CI 2.5%-4.2%) were dispensed during the study period. Medicines acting on the central nervous system were registered and dispensed the most at 21.0% and 18.0%, respectively, whereas antineoplastic and immunomodulation agents were registered and dispensed only 11% and 5%, respectively. A concern was that only 13.0% of registered medicines were originators, with most either as generics, including branded generics, or pseudo-generics.ConclusionRegulatory measures should be implemented to ensure increased medicine access post-registration for new originators, especially for priority disease areas that benefit patients. Mental health diseases and improved access to oncology medicines require special attention and further investigation in South Africa.",2023,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
Exploring the Mechanism of Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid Against Mosquito Bite Dermatitis Through Network Pharmacology and in Vitro Validation,Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid (HXZQOL); mosquito bite dermatitis; quercetin; JUN; IL-17 signaling pathway; anti cellular inflammation experiment; INFLAMMATION; APIGENIN,"Objective: Traditional Chinese patent medicine Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid (HXZQOL) can be used topical to treat mosquito bite dermatitis (MBD). The study aimed to explore the potential mechanism of HXZQOL in treatment of MBD based on network pharmacology and experimental validation. Methods: TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction and PubChem database were used to predict the active compounds and targets of HXZQOL and GeneCards database was utilized to predict the potential targets of MBD. Target interaction analysis was performed using Venn database, PPI and core targets were assessed using String database, and Cytoscape. Enrichment analysis on Gene Ontology(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were performed using David online tool. HXZQOL-compound-target-pathway-MBD networks were constructed using Cytoscape. Molecular docking was carried out with Autodock vina. The inflammation model of HaCaT cells induced by TNF-a/IFN-gamma was established .to validate the mechanism of HXZQOL against MBD, with the levels of inflammatory factors and protein related to IL-7 signaling pathway assessed using Elisa and Western Blot. Results: HXZQOL contained 154 active compounds and shared 88 common targets with MBD. Quercetin, apigenin, ursolic acid and luteolin were identified as potential candidate compounds, while JUN, IL-6, TNF and VEGFA were suggested as main potential targets. HXZQOL was found to act on MBD through multiple pathways including IL-17, AGE-RAGE and TNF signaling pathways. The candidate compounds demonstrated effectively binding to JUN and IL-6 targets, with binding energies below -5 kcal/mol. Western blot experiments confirmed that these compounds could down-regulate the expression of JUN protein in IL-17 signaling pathway, and significantly reduce levels of inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-6 and NO in HaCaT cells. Conclusion: HXZQOL mainly exerts its anti MAD effect by reducing inflammation. The relevant results have laid the foundation for improving the local anti MBD effect of HXZQOL and the secondary development of HXZQOL formulations.",2024,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Food Science & Technology,1

Additionally, by using faster and more economical screening methods, effective synergistic drug candidates can be rapidly identified, facilitating faster paths to clinical testing. In this work, a rapid method was standardized to identify possible synergisms from drug combinations. We analyzed the possible reduction in the antiviral effective concentration of drugs already approved by the FDA, such as ivermectin (IVM), ribavirin (RIBA), and acyclovir (ACV) against Zika virus (ZIKV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and herpes virus type 2 (HHV-2). Essential oils (EOs) were also included in the study since they have been reported for more than a couple of decades to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. We also continued studying the antiviral properties of one of our patented molecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, the ferruginol analog 18-(phthalimid-2-yl)ferruginol (phthFGL), which presented an IC99 of 25.6 mu M for the three types of virus. In general, the combination of IVM, phthFGL, and oregano EO showed the greatest synergism potential against CHIKV, ZIKV, and HHV-2. For instance, this combination achieved reductions in the IC99 value of each component up to similar to 8-, similar to 27-, and similar to 12-fold for CHIKV, respectively. The ternary combination of RIBA, phthFGL, and oregano EO was slightly more efficient than the binary combination RIBA/phthFGL but much less efficient than IVM, phthFGL, and oregano EO, which indicates that IVM could contribute more to the differentiation of cell targets (for example via the inhibition of the host heterodimeric importin IMP alpha/beta 1 complex) than ribavirin. Statistical analysis showed significant differences among the combination groups tested, especially in the HHV-2 and CHIKV models, with p = 0.0098. Additionally, phthFGL showed a good pharmacokinetic profile that should encourage future optimization studies.",2023,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
The action of physiological and synthetic steroids on the calcium channel CatSper in human sperm,CatSper; steroids; human sperm; high-throughput screening; calcium signaling; pharmacophore modelling; acrosome reaction; HUMAN SPERMATOZOA; MALE-INFERTILITY; CA2+ CHANNEL; PROGESTERONE; ACTIVATION; PLASMA; RECEPTOR; SERUM; RESPONSIVENESS; IDENTIFICATION,"The sperm-specific channel CatSper (cation channel of sperm) controls the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) and plays an essential role in sperm function. It is mainly activated by the steroid progesterone (P4) but is also promiscuously activated by a wide range of synthetic and physiological compounds. These compounds include diverse steroids whose action on the channel is so far still controversial. To investigate the effect of these compounds on CatSper and sperm function, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to measure changes in [Ca2+](i) in human sperm and screened 1,280 approved and off-patent drugs including 90 steroids from the Prestwick chemical library. More than half of the steroids tested (53%) induced an increase in [Ca2+](i) and reduced the P4-induced Ca2+ influx in human sperm in a dose-dependent manner. Ten of the most potent steroids (activating and P4-inhibiting) were selected for a detailed analysis of their action on CatSper and their ability to act on sperm acrosome reaction (AR) and penetration in viscous media. We found that these steroids show an inhibitory effect on P4 but not on prostaglandin E1-induced CatSper activation, suggesting that they compete for the same binding site as P4. Pregnenolone, dydrogesterone, epiandrosterone, nandrolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone acetate (DHEA) were found to activate CatSper at physiologically relevant concentrations within the nanomolar range. Like P4, most tested steroids did not significantly affect the AR while stanozolol and estropipate slightly increased sperm penetration into viscous medium. Furthermore, using a hybrid approach integrating pharmacophore analysis and statistical modelling, we were able to screen in silico for steroids that can activate the channel and define the physicochemical and structural properties required for a steroid to exhibit agonist activity against CatSper. Overall, our results indicate that not only physiological but also synthetic steroids can modulate the activity of CatSper with varying potency and if bound to CatSper prior to P4, could impair the timely CatSper activation necessary for proper fertilization to occur.",2023,Cell Biology; Developmental Biology,1
Kangaroos and liver fluke: The role played in cross-species transmission and drug resistance,Kangaroo; Liver fluke; Cross-species transmission; Drug resistance; FASCIOLA-HEPATICA INFECTIONS; TRICLABENDAZOLE RESISTANCE; CHALLENGE INFECTIONS; COPROANTIGEN ELISA; SHEEP; IMMATURE; EFFICACY; DIAGNOSIS; ANIMALS; ANTHELMINTICS,"Australian livestock are challenged by liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) in grazing regions endemic to the intermediate snail host. Liver fluke infests a wide range of herbivores including free-roaming wildlife such as kangaroos (Macropods). The role played by Macropods in cross-species transmission and as vectors for anthelmintic resistance is largely unknown. In Phase 1 of this study, liver fluke of Eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus Shaw, 1790) origin (Kangaroo isolate) were artificially infected in sheep to confirm establishment and cross-species transmission. In Phase 2, the efficacy of triclabendazole (TCBZ) was assessed in vivo against the Kangaroo isolate to identify any drug resistance. Forty (40) merino sheep were housed in pens and allocated to one of 4 groups (Groups 1-4). Groups 1 and 2 were artificially infected with a TCBZ resistant liver fluke isolate (Oberon) originating from sheep whilst Groups 3 and 4 were infected with the Kangaroo isolate (Phase 1). At 9 weeks post infection (wpi), sheep in Groups 2 and 4 were treated with 10 mg/kg TCBZ (Phase 2). Sheep were subsequently euthanased at 11 wpi to conduct total fluke counts (TFC) in the liver. Faecal samples were collected fortnightly to measure fluke egg counts and coproantigens. Individual blood samples were collected, concurrently with faecal sampling, to monitor haematocrit and plasma proteins levels. Liver fluke of kangaroo origin established to patent infections in sheep with similar establishment and pathogenicity to the Oberon isolate. TCBZ achieved an 86 % reduction in TFC (99.8 % - adult fluke, 0 % - immature fluke) in sheep with the Kangaroo isolate and a 28 % reduction in the Oberon isolate (37 % - adult, 0 % - immature fluke). An 89 % reduction in faecal coproantigens was observed in sheep with the Kangaroo isolate and no reduction in sheep with Oberon. This study confirmed cross-species transmission of liver fluke from a kangaroo to sheep. When cohabiting the livestock grazing environment, kangaroos may act as reservoirs for liver fluke and vectors for drug resistance within liver fluke endemic areas.",2021,Parasitology; Veterinary Sciences,1
Chemoprophylaxis Vaccination: Phase I Study to Explore Stage-specific Immunity to Plasmodium falciparum in US Adults,chemoprophylaxis vaccination with sporozoites; malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; primaquine; chloroquine; HUMAN MALARIA; HUMAN VOLUNTEERS; PROTECTION; IMMUNIZATION; CHALLENGE; BLOOD; CHLOROQUINE; PRIMAQUINE; MOSQUITOS; HUMANS,"Background Chemoprophylaxis vaccination with sporozoites (CVac) with chloroquine induces protection against a homologous Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) challenge, but whether blood-stage parasite exposure is required for protection remains unclear. Chloroquine suppresses and clears blood-stage parasitemia, while other antimalarial drugs, such as primaquine, act against liver-stage parasites. Here, we evaluated CVac regimens using primaquine and/or chloroquine as the partner drug to discern whether blood-stage parasite exposure impacts protection against homologous controlled human malaria infection. Methods In a Phase I, randomized, partial double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 36 malaria-naive adults, all CVac subjects received chloroquine prophylaxis and bites from 12-15 P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes (CVac-chloroquine arm) at 3 monthly iterations, and some received postexposure primaquine (CVac-primaquine/chloroquine arm). Drug control subjects received primaquine, chloroquine, and uninfected mosquito bites. After a chloroquine washout, subjects, including treatment-naive infectivity controls, underwent homologous, PfSPZ controlled human malaria infection and were monitored for parasitemia for 21 days. Results No serious adverse events occurred. During CVac, all but 1 subject in the study remained blood-smear negative, while only 1 subject (primaquine/chloroquine arm) remained polymerase chain reaction-negative. Upon challenge, compared to infectivity controls, 3/3 chloroquine arm subjects displayed delayed patent parasitemia (P = .01) but not sterile protection, while 3/11 primaquine/chloroquine subjects remained blood-smear negative. Conclusions CVac-primaquine/chloroquine is safe and induces sterile immunity to P. falciparum in some recipients, but a single 45 mg dose of primaquine postexposure does not completely prevent blood-stage parasitemia. Unlike previous studies, CVac-chloroquine did not produce sterile immunity. Clinical Trials Registration NCT01500980. Chemoprophylaxis vaccination with sporozoites (CVac) with chloroquine and primaquine is safe and induces sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum in some recipients, but does not completely prevent blood-stage parasitemia.

Auranofin reveals therapeutic anticancer potential by triggering distinct molecular cell death mechanisms and innate immunity in mutant p53 non-small cell lung cancer,Auranofin; Thioredoxin reductase; Non-small cell lung cancer; Mutant p53; Oxidative stress; Cancer cell death; TRIETHYLPHOSPHINE GOLD AURANOFIN; THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE 1; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; DRUG-RESISTANCE; IN-VITRO; EXPRESSION; INHIBITOR; APOPTOSIS; GLUTATHIONE; PROMOTES,"Auranofin (AF) is an FDA-approved antirheumatic drug with anticancer properties that acts as a thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR) inhibitor. The exact mechanisms through which AF targets cancer cells remain elusive. To shed light on the mode of action, this study provides an in-depth analysis on the molecular mechanisms and immunogenicity of AF-mediated cytotoxicity in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line NCI?H1299 (p53 Null) and its two isogenic derivates with mutant p53 R175H or R273H accumulation. TrxR is highly expressed in a panel of 72 NSCLC patients, making it a valid druggable target in NSCLC for AF. The presence of mutant p53 overexpression was identified as an important sensitizer for AF in (isogenic) NSCLC cells as it was correlated with reduced thioredoxin (Trx) levels in vitro. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress response, DNA damage, granzyme A (GZMA) signaling and ferroptosis. Although functionally AF appeared a potent inhibitor of GPX4 in all NCI?H1299 cell lines, the induction of lipid peroxidation and consequently ferroptosis was limited to the p53 R273H expressing cells. In the p53 R175H cells, AF mainly induced large-scale DNA damage and replication stress, leading to the induction of apoptotic cell death rather than ferroptosis. Importantly, all cell death types were immunogenic since the release of danger signals (ecto-calreticulin, ATP and HMGB1) and dendritic cell maturation occurred irrespective of (mutant) p53 expression. Finally, we show that AF sensitized cancer cells to caspase-independent natural killer cell-mediated killing by downregulation of several key targets of GZMA. Our data provides novel insights on AF as a potent, clinically available, off-patent cancer drug by targeting mutant p53 cancer cells through distinct cell death mechanisms (apoptosis and ferroptosis). In addition, AF improves the innate immune response at both cytostatic (natural killer cell-mediated killing) and cytotoxic concentrations (dendritic cell maturation).",2021,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,1
National trends in prescription drug expenditures and projections for 2022,biosimilars; cancer drugs; COVID-19; drug expenditures; pandemic; public policy; ,"Purpose To report historical patterns of pharmaceutical expenditures, to identify factors that may influence future spending, and to predict growth in drug spending in 2022 in the United States, with a focus on the nonfederal hospital and clinic sectors. Methods Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2022 were reviewed-including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for biosimilars, cancer drugs, generics, COVID-19 pandemic influence, and specialty drugs. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2022 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. Results In 2021, overall pharmaceutical expenditures in the US grew 7.7% compared to 2020, for a total of $576.9 billion. Utilization (a 4.8% increase), price (a 1.9% increase) and new drugs (a 1.1% increase) drove this increase. Adalimumab was the top drug in terms of overall expenditures in 2021, followed by apixaban and dulaglutide. Drug expenditures were $39.6 billion (a 8.4% increase) and $105.0 billion (a 7.7% increase) in nonfederal hospitals and in clinics, respectively. In clinics and hospitals, new products and increased utilization growth drove growth, with decreasing prices for both sectors acting as an expense restraint. Several new drugs that are likely to influence spending are expected to be approved in 2022. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures along with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion For 2022, we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 4.0% to 6.0%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 7.0% to 9.0% and 3.0% to 5.0%, respectively, compared to 2021. These national estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth may not be representative of any particular health system because of the myriad of local factors that influence actual spending.",2022,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,1
Deciphering the Active Compounds and Mechanisms of Qixuehe Capsule on Qi Stagnation and Blood Stasis Syndrome: A Network Pharmacology Study,; CEREBRAL INFARCTION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; EXPRESSION; POLYMORPHISMS; COAGULATION; DATABASE; RISK; IDENTIFICATION; METABOLOMICS; ANTIOXIDANT,"Background. Qixuehe capsule (QXH), a Chinese patent medicine, has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of menstrual disorders. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome (QS-BSS) is the main syndrome type of menstrual disorders. However, the pharmacodynamic effect of QXH in treating QS-BSS is not clear, and the main active compounds and underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Methods. A rat model of QS-BSS was established to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of QXH. Thereafter, a network pharmacology approach was performed to decipher the active compounds and underlying mechanisms of QXH. Results. QXH could significantly reduce the rising whole blood viscosity (WBV) and plasma viscosity (PV) but also normalize prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and fibrinogen (FIB) content in QS-BSS rats. Based on partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), the low-dose QXH-intervened (QXH-L) and the high-dose QXH-intervened (QXH-H) groups seemed the most effective by calculating the relative distance to normality. Through network pharmacology, QXH may improve hemorheological abnormality mainly via 185 compounds-51 targets-28 pathways, whereas 184 compounds-68 targets-28 pathways were associated with QXH in improving coagulopathy. Subsequently, 25 active compounds of QXH were verified by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS. Furthermore, 174 active compounds of QXH were shared in improving hemorheological abnormality and coagulopathy in QS-BSS, each of which can act on multiple targets to be mainly involved in complement and coagulation cascades, leukocyte transendothelial migration, PPAR signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and arachidonic acid metabolism. The attribution of active compounds indicated that Angelicae Sinensis Radix (DG), Paeoniae Radix Rubra (CS), Carthami Flos (HH), Persicae Semen (TR), and Corydalis Rhizoma (YHS) were the vital herbs of QXH in treating QS-BSS. Conclusion. QXH can improve the hemorheology abnormality and coagulopathy of QS-BSS, which may result from the synergy of multiple compounds, targets, and pathways.",2020,Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1
Chemical profiling of Sanjin tablets and exploration of their effective substances and mechanism in the treatment of urinary tract infections,Sanjin tablets; urinary tract infections; chemical profiling; LC-MSn; network pharmacology; molecular docking; AKT/PROTEIN KINASE-B; PROTEIN-KINASE; IDENTIFICATION; QUERCETIN; CHROMATOGRAPHY; CONSTITUENTS; METABOLITES; FLAVONOIDS; ACIDS,"Introduction: Sanjin tablets (SJT) are a well-known Chinese patent drug that have been used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) for the last 40 years. The drug consists of five herbs, but only 32 compounds have been identified, which hinders the clarification of its effective substances and mechanism.Methods: The chemical constituents of SJT and their effective substances and functional mechanism involved in the treatment of UTIs were investigated by using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap-time of flight-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-IT-TOF-MSn), network pharmacology, and molecular docking.Results: A total of 196 compounds of SJT (SJT-MS) were identified, and 44 of them were unequivocally identified by comparison with the reference compounds. Among 196 compounds, 13 were potential new compounds and 183 were known compounds. Among the 183 known compounds, 169 were newly discovered constituents of SJT, and 93 compounds were not reported in the five constituent herbs. Through the network pharmacology method, 119 targets related to UTIs of 183 known compounds were predicted, and 20 core targets were screened out. Based on the compound-target relationship analysis, 94 compounds were found to act on the 20 core targets and were therefore regarded as potential effective compounds. According to the literature, 27 of the 183 known compounds were found to possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities and were verified as effective substances, of which 20 were first discovered in SJT. Twelve of the 27 effective substances overlapped with the 94 potential effective compounds and were determined as key effective substances of SJT. The molecular docking results showed that the 12 key effective substances and 10 selected targets of the core targets have good affinity for each other.Discussion: These results provide a solid foundation for understanding the effective substances and mechanism of SJT.",2023,Chemistry,1

Design/methodology/approachThis research is applied in terms of purpose and descriptive-survey in terms of data collection method. This research has been done in a qualitative-quantitative method. In the qualitative part, due to the nature of the data in this study, expert interviews have been used. The sample studied in this research includes 35 managers and expert professors with experience in the field of knowledge management working in universities and high-tech industries who have been selected by the method of snowball. In the quantitative part, the questionnaire tool and DANP multivariate decision-making method have been used. FindingsIn this study, a multicriteria decision-making technique using a combination of DEMATEL and ANP (DANP) was used to identify and prioritize the factors affecting the knowledge flow in high-tech industries. In this study, the factors affecting the knowledge flow, including 8 main factors and 31 subfactors, were selected. Human resources, organizational structure, organizational culture, knowledge communication, knowledge management tools, knowledge characteristics, laws, policies and regulations and financial resources were effective in improving knowledge flow, respectively. Originality/valueBy studying the research, it was found that the study area is limited, and the previous work has remained at the level of documentation and little practical use has been done. In previous research, the discussion of knowledge flow has not been very open, and doing incomplete work causes limited experiences and increases cost and time wastage, and parallel work may also occur. Therefore, to complete the knowledge management circle and fully achieve the research objectives, as well as to make available and transfer the experiences of people working in this field and also to save time and reduce costs, the contents and factors of previous models have been counted. It is designed for high-tech industries, a model for the flow of knowledge.",2024,Business & Economics,1

I show how the scientific and the economic were intertwined in Kim's entrepreneurial lives, and so were the public and the private, commerce and law and virtue. As the founder of Toolgen, a biotech company specializing in genome editing, Kim built his career as a pioneer in biotech venture from the late 1990s, at a time when the Korean government tried to find certain opportunities in biotechnology amid the Asian financial crisis. I situate Kim's early career as a CEO of Toolgen and his return to an academic post at Seoul National University (SNU) within the rise of biotechnology entrepreneurship and the institutionalization of academic patenting in South Korea as an alternative to catch-up industrial and innovation policy that would free the country from the dependence that its own lack of science and technological innovation imposed on it. By 2005, as I show, Kim had emerged as an exemplary entrepreneurial scientist at SNU, a role model for reforming an old, tradition-bound research university into an entrepreneurial university, thereby helping to transform South Korea's industrial economy into a knowledge economy in an age of globalization. The fate of Toolgen and the scientific career of Kim, however, reflected the emergence of biotechnology entrepreneurship not only of perceived opportunity but of considerable resentments. I will end this paper with a brief discussion of a recent controversy over the ownership of his invention of the CRISPR technology at SNU. His story is thus a vista of the new ideas and sentiments of the 21(st) century global biotechnology manifested in South Korea.",2022,Area Studies; History & Philosophy of Science; Asian Studies,1
An intelligent content-based image retrieval methodology using transfer learning for digital IP protection,Convolutional neural network (CNN); Triplet neural network; Trademark (TM) infringement; Trademark management; content-based image retrieval (CBIR); FEATURES; SCALE,"Trademarks are used by companies to help customers identify products or services using images or logos in addition to slogans, words, names, sounds, smells, color, and motions. Trademark logos are widely distributed through advertising and published through online media websites and social networks such as Facebook, Pinterest, and Flicker. The intellectual property (IP) rights of the trademark owners have strong legal protection when registered with international intellectual property platforms such as the US Patent and Trademark Office and the World Intellectual Property Office. Using a registered trademark without prior consent of the owner may result in intellectual property infringement with severe legal consequences under civil or criminal law. Companies invest large capital resources in protecting their trademark from being copied or misused in ways that confuse the customers or steal market share. This research focuses on trademark (TM) logo image retrieval systems used in the cyber marketplaces to identify similar TM logo images online automatically and intelligently. The methodology developed for TM logo similarity measurement is based on content-based image retrieval. Content retrieval reduces the gap between high-level semantic interpretation of human vision and the low-level features processed by the machine. The proposed transfer learning methodology uses embedded learning with triplet loss to fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network model. The Logo-2K+ large-scale logo dataset is re-organized and divided into the top 70% as the training set and the remaining 30% as the testing set. The results show that the novel transfer learning approach is developed and demonstrated in this research for the intelligent automatic detection of similar TM logo images with high accuracy. The verification experiments (trained with 7625 logos and tested with 3221 logos) demonstrates that the Recall@10 of the test set can reach 95% using the advanced convolutional neural network model (VGG19) adjusted with the novel transfer learning methodology.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering,1
"FDA approval, clinical trial evidence, efficacy, epidemiology, and price for non-orphan and ultra-rare, rare, and common orphan cancer drug indications: cross sectional analysis",; RETROSPECTIVE COHORT; COST,"OBJECTIVE To analyze the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, trials, unmet needs, benefit, and pricing of ultra-rare (<6600 affected US citizens), rare (6600-200 000 citizens), and common (>200 000 citizens) orphan cancer drug indications and non-orphan cancer drug indications. DESIGN Cross sectional analysis. SETTING Data from Drugs@FDA, FDA labels, Global Burden of Disease study, and Medicare and Medicaid. POPULATION 170 FDA approved drugs across 455 cancer indications between 2000 and 2022. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Comparison of non-orphan and ultra-rare, rare, and common orphan indications regarding regulatory approval, trials, epidemiology, and price. Hazard ratios for overall survival and progression-free survival were meta-analyzed. RESULTS 161 non-orphan and 294 orphan cancer drug indications were identified, of which 25 were approved for ultra-rare diseases, 205 for rare diseases, and 64 for common diseases. Drugs for ultra-rare orphan indications were more frequently first in class (76% v 48% v 38% v 42%; P<0.001), monotherapies (88% v 69% v 72% v 55%; P=0.001), for hematologic cancers (76% v 66% v 0% v 0%;P<0.001), and supported by smaller trials (median 85 v 199 v 286 v 521 patients; P<0.001), of single arm (84% v 44% v 28% v 21%; P<0.001) phase 1/2 design (88% v 45% v 45% v 27%; P<0.001) compared with rare and common orphan indications and non-orphan indications. Drugs for common orphan indications were more often biomarker directed (69% v 26% v 12%; P<0.001), first line (77% v 39% v 20%; P<0.001), small molecules (80% v 62% v 48%; P<0.001) benefiting from quicker time to first FDA approval (median 5.7 v 7.1 v 8.9 years; P=0.02) than those for rare and ultra-rare orphan indications. Drugs for ultra -rare, rare, and common orphan indications offered a significantly greater progression-free survival benefit (hazard ratio 0.53 v 0.51 v 0.49 v 0.64; P<0.001), but not overall survival benefit (0.50 v 0.73 v 0.71 v 0.74; P=0.06), than non-orphans. In single arm trials, tumor response rates were greater for drugs for ultra-rare orphan indications than for rare or common orphan indications and non-orphan indications (objective response rate 57% v 48% v 55% v 33%; P<0.001). Disease incidence/prevalence, five year survival, and the number of available treatments were lower, whereas disability adjusted life years per patient were higher, for ultra-rare orphan indications compared with rare or common indications and non-orphan indications. For 147 on-patent drugs with available data in 2023, monthly prices were higher for ultra-rare orphan indications than for rare or common orphan indications and non-orphan indications ($70 128 (55 pound 971; euro63 370) v $33 313 v $16 484 v $14 508; P<0.001). For 48 on-patent drugs with available longitudinal data from 2005 to 2023, prices increased by 94% for drugs for orphan indications and 50% for drugs for non-orphan indications on average. CONCLUSIONS The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 incentivizes development of drugs not only for rare diseases but also for ultra-rare diseases and subsets of common diseases. These orphan indications fill significant unmet needs, yet their approval is based on small, non-robust trials that could overestimate efficacy outcomes. A distinct ultra-orphan designation with greater financial incentives could encourage and expedite drug development for ultra-rare diseases.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,1
DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN INFERIOR AND NON-INFERIOR OFFICERS UNDER THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE-A QUESTION OF SIGNIFICANCE,; POWER,"An important part of the constitutional design of the federal government is the separation of powers. A key aspect of that design is the Appointments Clause, which governs how officers of the United States are installed in their positions. The clause presumptively requires that all such officers must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. But it authorizes Congress to bypass that procedure and vest the appointment of inferior Officers exclusively in the President, the Courts of Law, or the Heads of Department. How to distinguish between inferior and non-inferior officers, and thus how to determine who among federal officialdom must be appointed by the President with the Senate's approval, is a task that has bedeviled the Supreme Court for decades. In its 1997 decision, Edmond v. United States, the Court held that the distinction turns on the degree to which an officer is directed and supervised by other, non-inferior officers. The Court articulated three factors to guide that assessment, including whether the officer is protected from removal and whether the officer has the power unilaterally to make a final decision. In its ruling this past Term in United States v. Arthrex, Inc., the high court signaled a departure from Edmond and embarked on a different analytical path. Effectively eschewing the Edmond direction-and-supervision standard along with its multi-factor analysis, the Court appears to have adopted a straightforward significance standard, such that an officer is non-inferior if the officer wields significant power. The Court's shift in Arthrex is, however, more implicit than explicit, given the precedential constraints of Edmond and other cases that have employed significance as the standard to distinguish officers from non officers, rather than inferior from non-inferior officers. Consequently, the Court's analysis in Arthrex is set forth using the terms of Edmond. But Arthrex's essentially exclusive reliance on the Edmond final decision factor coupled with its emphasis on the importance of maintaining accountability for official action that, like the patent dispute at issue in Arthrex, can have tremendous impact on the property rights and other liberties of private parties suggests that the Court's allegiance to Edmond is superficial and strategic. If, then, the Court is moving towards a plain significance standard and our review of the Court's ruling concludes that it is then this shift should be applauded. It makes the Court's Appointments Clause case law better cohere with that clause's original meaning, which does not use significance to distinguish officers from non-officers, but likely does so to distinguish inferior from non-inferior officers. It also better furthers the policy of democratic accountability, a policy that the Court's recent cases concerning the Appointments Clause including Arthrex as well as those concerning the coordinate issue of the President's power to remove officers, have stressed, and which animates the Constitution's rules and checks governing the selection and control of the Executive officer corps.",2022,Government & Law,1
Self-efficacy and entrepreneurial performance of start-ups,Entrepreneurship; Firm performance; General self-efficacy; Survival; Job creation; Innovation; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MEDIATING ROLE; SURVIVAL; GROWTH; CREATIVITY; MOTIVATION; ATTITUDES; SUCCESS; CULTURE,"Plain English SummaryThe self-belief in own abilities to cope with adversity and succeed at an endeavor is called self-efficacy. This belief can outweigh other doubts or self-beliefs such that we can be resilient on our path to reaching goals. Can this belief influence the performance of entrepreneurs with nascent start-ups? Is this influence different for female and male entrepreneurs? Accounting for other factors that might influence business outcomes, we find that self-efficacy alone influences the chances of business survival, having employees, applying for patents or trademark protection, as well as the start-up generated income. On the other hand, we find similar levels of self-efficacy between female and male entrepreneurs, observing that self-efficacy affects the probability of growth-related outcomes for both females and males. This contributes to the understanding of what drives start-up growth and success, which is crucial for the development of target-oriented policies, including training measures, coaching offers, and business incubators. Self-efficacy reflects the self-belief that one can persistently perform difficult and novel tasks while coping with adversity. As such beliefs reflect how individuals behave, think, and act, they are key for successful entrepreneurial activities. While existing literature mainly analyzes the influence of the task-related construct of entrepreneurial self-efficacy, we take a different perspective and investigate, based on a representative sample of 1,405 German business founders, how the personality characteristic of generalized self-efficacy influences start-up performance as measured by a broad set of business outcomes up to 19 months after business creation. Outcomes include start-up survival and entrepreneurial income, as well as growth-oriented outcomes such as job creation and innovation. We find statistically significant and economically important positive effects of high scores of self-efficacy on start-up survival and entrepreneurial income, which become even stronger when focusing on the growth-oriented outcome of innovation. Furthermore, we observe that generalized self-efficacy is similarly distributed between female and male business founders, with effects being partly stronger for female entrepreneurs. Our findings are important for policy instruments that are meant to support firm growth by facilitating the design of more target-oriented offers for training, coaching, and entrepreneurial incubators.",2023,Business & Economics,1
Do academic spin-offs outperform young innovative companies? A comparison of survival rates and growth,Young innovative company; Academic spin-off; New venture growth; Survival rate; Regional public policies; MANAGEMENT TEAM COMPOSITION; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; FIRM SURVIVAL; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; CAPABILITIES; IMPACT; STRATEGIES; MORTALITY,"Purpose This article investigates the distinctive characteristics and the performance of academic spin-offs within young innovative companies (YICs) supported by public regional agencies. Considering that academic spin-offs are characterized by high intensity in innovation and technology transfer, we raise the issue of their performance relative to other YICs. Design/methodology/approach The authors focus on YICs which receive support from public or semi-public institutions at the early stage of their development as a reward for their innovative business ideas. The study is performed in two steps. First, the authors estimate the growth of the academic spin-offs within a set of YICs supported for fewer than 5 years. This estimation is based on data gathered in 2014. Second, the authors investigate the survival of these supported YICs with the Cox proportional hazards model, 5 years later, at the end of 2019. Findings Results reveal that academic spin-offs are more able to capture resources in the early stages: These firms have more patents, more external funding and higher increases in the number of employees. The authors also demonstrate that academic spin-offs have the highest survival rates. Research limitations/implications The drawback of the studies on ASOs is the limited sample. The main issue is related to survival analysis. Limitation of the sample sizes precludes from in-depth survival analyses, which may highlight fundamental differences in the development patterns of the firm. Practical implications The study's results provide evidence on how the identity of academic spin-offs based on technology transfer act as a positive signal to obtain legitimacy. It is of particular interest for entrepreneurs who can rely on trust provided by their parent institution to engage in negotiations with different stakeholders. Moreover, results give insights to policymakers on the usefulness to invest on academic spin-offs because of its outperforming results. Originality/value The results provide important insights for designing, conducting and monitoring policies that favor innovation. Moreover, it demonstrates to universities, research institutions and entrepreneurs engaged in technology transfer the economic and social usefulness of their approach.",2022,Business & Economics,1
Evaluation of Tolerance and Trichological Efficacy of a Food Supplement in Men and Women with Telogen Effluvium-like Disorder,hair thinning; telogen effluvium; Ganoderma lucidum; Linum usitatissimum L; Cynara scolymus L; Galeopsis segetum Neck; rutin; ornithine; ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA; HAIR LOSS; POLYAMINES; NUTRITION; HEALTH; SERUM; IRON; ZINC,"Hair thinning is a very common problem in dermatology, affecting both men and women, and can strongly impact the quality of life of subjects. In this view, therapies that aim to reduce the appearance of thinning by delaying, arresting, or reversing the course of hair thinning are highly desirable. A novel nutraceutical product (NS) containing active botanicals, a patented composition comprising rutin and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), zinc, biotin, and ornithine, has been developed to improve hair growth in subjects with hair thinning. Sixty subjects with telogen effluvium-like hair loss were randomized 1:1 in two groups (NS vs. placebo) and treated for three months and evaluated at the baseline visit (T0), and after 15 days (T1) and one (T2), two (T3), and three (T4) months of treatment. Two follow-up visits one month (T5) and two months after the last assumption (T6) were also included in the protocol. Subjects were evaluated for the percentage of hair in the anagen phase, density of hair in the anagen phase (n/cm(2)), vellus hair (miniaturized, smaller, and thinner hair), and the entity of hair loss in the telogen phase (pull test). NS supplementation produced a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in anagen hair and hair density versus baseline from 15 days (T1) of treatment and this effect was not detectable for placebo. Moreover, a clinically/statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in vellus hair was also reported, suggesting not only a rapid reduction of the process of miniaturization of the hair but also a transformation of vellus hair into terminal hair. The NS treatment also showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in tensile strength till T6 (vs. placebo). A higher percentage of subjects who took the NS noted a reduction in daily hair loss, an increase in brightness, and the presence of stronger hair. No side effects were reported. The present study confirms the clinical efficacy and safety of novel nutraceutical supplements in men and women with hair thinning, acting as a multi-targeted therapeutic approach to hair thinning due to TE-like phenomena.",2022,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Dermatology,1

Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have received much attention for cancer treatment. Nanocarriers are the delivery systems which are prepared by alteration of the size (1-1000 nm) and shape of a material to the nanorange level. Nanocarriers are prepared by utilizing natural, polymeric, inorganic magnetic silica-based materials. Various nanocarriers including liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, magnetic nanoparticles, and other inorganic nanoparticles have been investigated for diagnostic, therapeutic, and drug targeting in cancer therapy. Nanocarriers act as a cancer-specific drug delivery or diagnostic agent by inherent passive targeting mechanism or adopted active targeting strategies by altering the surface properties with specific ligands. Targeted nanoparticulate systems increase the accumulation of the chemotherapeutic agent in the tumor tissue and reduce the toxicity to healthy cells. Nanocarriers extend the drug release for a longer duration and protect the drug from degradation. Nanocarriers are also proven effective for improving the pharmacokinetics of poorly soluble hydrophobic drugs by solubilizing or permeating them through lipophilic biological barriers. Approximately 1500 patents are filed with respect to nanocarrier-based formulation of cancer therapeutics. However, clinically approved nanocarrier-based therapeutics are very few in number, but the trend reveals the number of nanocarrier-based formulations is increased in recent years. The clinical studies of nanocarrier-based formulations have shown improved safety and efficacy. The main hitch in the commercialization of nanocarriers is the difficulty to achieve optimum particle size distribution, scale-up of the formulation, and reproducibility. Conversely, nanocarrier-based therapeutics lack adequate guidelines from drug regulatory authorities. The proposed chapter will address the different nanocarriers and advances in the surface engineering of nanoparticles for cancer cell targeting, diagnosis, and drug delivery applications. The focus of this book chapter is to provide an insight into various nanocarriers for their multiple applications in the treatment of cancer.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Research & Experimental Medicine; Materials Science,1
Cerebral revascularization for complex vertebrobasilar artery dissecting aneurysms,Cerebral revascularization; Bypass; Vertebrobasilar artery; Dissecting aneurysm; Treatment; Surgical algorithm; BYPASS; OCCLUSION; OUTCOMES; SERIES,"Vertebrobasilar artery dissecting aneurysms (VBDAs) are the most surgically challenging type of aneurysm. Cerebral revascularization is the ultimate treatment for complex VBDAs. We retrospectively analysed the characteristics, surgical outcomes and follow-up data of 21 patients who underwent cerebral revascularization to treat complex VBDAs from 2015 to 2022. According to the location of the aneurysm and the anatomic relationship between the VBDA and the PICA, VBDA patients were classified into four groups: aneurysms located at the VA with PICA involvement (10 patients), aneurysms located at the VA without PICA involvement (1 patient), aneurysms located at the basilar apex segment (1 patient) and aneurysms located at the basilar trunk segment (9 patients). A surgical algorithm for complex VBDAs was determined primarily by the location of the aneurysm, the status of the aneurysm and the ability of retrograde blood flow to reach the proximal vertebrobasilar artery. Surgical modalities for patients with aneurysms in the VA with PICA involvement included low-flow (OA-PICA) bypasses with aneurysm trapping, aneurysm excision or reconstructive clip in 8 patients and STA-PCA bypass combined with PICA preservation and aneurysm trapping in 2 patients. In patients with aneurysms in the VA without PICA involvement, aneurysm excision was performed without cerebral bypass. In patients with aneurysms in the basilar apex segment, high-flow bypass (ECA-RA-P2) with aneurysm trapping was performed. In patients with aneurysms in the basilar trunk segment, surgical modalities included high-flow bypasses (ECA-RA-P2 and LVA-RA-P2) with aneurysm trapping or proximal occlusion in 6 patients, ECA-RA-P2 bypass with partial proximal occlusion in 1 patient, ECA-RA-P2 bypass alone in 1 patient, and STA-PCA bypass with R-VA narrowing in 1 patient. Of the 21 patients, 20 experienced clinical improvement or no change, and 17 of 21 patients achieved favourable functional outcomes (mRS <= 2). However, one patient died of infarction and respiratory failure postoperatively. Aneurysms were completely obliterated in 13 patients, shrank in 5 patients and stabilized in 2 patients. The median follow-up period was 32.5 months. During the follow-up period, all bypasses were patent, and further clinical improvement was observed in 11 patients. Cerebral revascularization appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of complex VBDAs, and cerebral revascularization could act as a complementary treatment strategy.",2024,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,1
Electro living membrane bioreactor for highly efficient wastewater treatment and fouling mitigation: Influence of current density on process performances,Current density; Dynamic membrane formation; Membrane fouling; Membrane bioreactors; FORMING DYNAMIC MEMBRANE; FILTRATION RESISTANCE; ELECTROCOAGULATION; IMPROVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; REMOVAL; QUALITY; IMPACT; UNIT,"The next generation of the self-forming dynamic membrane, referred to in this study as the Living Membrane (LM), is a new patented technology based on an encapsulated biological layer that self-forms on a designed coarse-pore size support material during wastewater treatment and acts as a natural membrane filter. Integrating electrochemical processes with wastewater treatment using the LM approach has also been recently studied (the reactor is referred to as the Electro-Living Membrane Bioreactor or e-LMBR). This study investigated the effects of varying current densities, i.e., 0.3, 0.5, and 0.9 mA/cm(2), on the performance of an e-LMBR. The results were also compared with those of the Living Membrane Bioreactor or LMBR (without applied current density). Higher pollutant removals were observed in the presence of the electric field. However, the effect of varying applied current densities on the COD (98-99 %), NH3-N (97-99 %), and PO43- P (100 %) removals was not statistically significant. The more prominent differences (p < 0.05) were observed in the decrease of NO3--N concentrations from mixed liquor to effluent, with increasing current density resulting in lower mean NO3--N effluent concentrations (0.3 mA/cm(2): 6.13 mg/L; 0.5 mA/cm(2): 4.38 mg/L; 0.9 mA/cm(2): 3.70 mg/L). The reduction of NO3--N concentrations as wastewater permeated through the LM layer also confirmed its role in removing nitrogen-containing compounds. Higher current densities resulted in lower concentrations of fouling substances, particularly those of microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs). The average values of the temporal variation of transmembrane pressure (d(TMP)/d(t)) in the e-LMBR were extremely low, in the range of 0.013-0.041 kPa/day, throughout the operation period. The highest (d(TMP)/d(t)) was observed for the highest current density.

Pneumolysin is one of the main virulence factors produced by all types of pneumococci. This toxin (53 kDa) is a highly conserved protein that binds to cholesterol in eukaryotic cells, forming pores that lead to cell destruction. MethodsThe databases consulted were MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus. Articles were independently screened by title, abstract, and full text by two researchers, and using consensus to resolve any disagreements that occurred. Articles in other languages different from English, patents, cases report, notes, chapter books and reviews were excluded. Searches were restricted to the years 2000 to 2021. Methodological quality was evaluated using OHAT framework. ResultsForty-one articles describing the effects of different molecules that inhibit PLY were reviewed. Briefly, the inhibitory molecules found were classified into three main groups: those exerting a direct effect by binding and/or blocking PLY, those acting indirectly by preventing its effects on host cells, and those whose mechanisms are unknown. Although many molecules are proposed as toxin blockers, only some of them, such as antibiotics, peptides, sterols, and statins, have the probability of being implemented as clinical treatment. In contrast, for other molecules, there are limited studies that demonstrate efficacy in animal models with sufficient reliability. DiscussionMost of the studies reviewed has a good level of confidence. However, one of the limitations of this systematic review is the lack of homogeneity of the studies, what prevented to carry out a statistical comparison of the results or meta-analysis. ConclusionA panel of molecules blocking PLY activity are associated with the improvement of the inflammatory process triggered by the pneumococcal infection. Some molecules have already been used in humans for other purposes, so they could be safe for use in patients with pneumococcal infections. These patients might benefit from a second line treatment during the initial stages of the infection preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome and invasive pneumococcal diseases. Additional research using the presented set of compounds might further improve the clinical management of these patients.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
PARTISAN MOVEMENT IN SOUTHERN FRANCE IN 1814: THE CASE OF FLORIAN,history of France; Napoleonic wars; military-historical anthropology; partisans; Soult; Florian; Bory de Saint-Vincent; ,"In the face of the invasion of the Allied troops into the territory of France, Napoleon highly relied on the popular resistance of the French to the enemy. The author considers the history of a partisan detachment operating in the South of France under the command of Florian, a half-hero or half-robber. What was the real contribution of partisans to the course of military operations? What was the motivation of their leaders? What was the relationship between the military command and the commanders of the partisan detachments? How did the civil authorities and the local civilian population treat the partisans? The paucity of official documents is compensated by sources of personal origin, which make it possible to reveal the human dimension of this small war. In 1814, Captain Florian, who led a detachment of twenty volunteers, behaved like a free corsair, whose actions at times situationally coincided with the interests of the military command. Lacking an official partisan patent, he attacked the allies' supply trains, robbed army stores, intercepted English couriers, and did not disdain the capture of officers' personal luggage. Having had a reputation as a marauder in Spain since 1813, Florian in 1814 allowed himself all sorts of excesses in relation to the local population. The civil authorities in the person of the prefect tried to reason with him and certain individuals disinterestedly worked for him as pointers. Only in March did Marshal Soult try to intensify the creation of partisan detachments and subordinate them to a single command. Florian claimed to have unlimited powers from Soult. However, the negotiations between Soult's representative Major Bory de Saint-Vincent and Florian ended in nothing: the complaints of the civil authorities and the reputation of the partisan commander caused discontent on the part of the marshal. The last action of Florian's partisans was an attack on April 12 on an English courier, from whom a watch and a large amount of money were confiscated according the laws of war. Mythologized in popular scholarship and educational literature of the 1870s, the partisan movement in France in 1814 was distinguished by a very modest scale and limited actions, and the line between ordinary robbery and a patriotic action was sometimes difficult to discern.",2023,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,1
Pentazocine Misuse among Sickle Cell Disease Patients and The Role of Lack of Enforcement of Opioid Dispensing Regulations by Community Pharmacies: A Descriptive Observational Study,; ,"Introduction. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic disease characterized by debilitating bone pains which commonly necessitate the use of analgesic drugs including opioids and psychotropic substances such as pentazocine which are controlled medicines in Nigeria. Opioid misuse including dependence and addiction is an increasing trend among SCD patients, and it has serious adverse implications on their social, economic, and physical well-being. The role of lack of implementation of existent regulation on the dispensing of opioids by pharmacies has not been adequately investigated. Objective. The primary objective of this study is to define the sociodemographic and clinical implications of pentazocine misuse among patients with SCD and to describe the contributions of lack of enforcement of opioid dispensing regulations to this menace. Materials and Methods. The study was a descriptive observational study. A 29-item pretested and prevalidated questionnaire was administered to 21 SCD patients with an established history of pentazocine misuse and addiction to establish their demographics, details of opioid use, and their clinical effects. Nine community pharmacies were interviewed to ascertain their knowledge of controlled medicines and their compliance to existent regulations on the dispensation of opioids. Results. The median (interquartile range) age of the SCD subjects was 24 years. The majority of subjects (14, 66.7%) had tertiary education. Fifteen (71.4%) of them had a history of pentazocine misuse for over two years. All subjects source pentazocine injection from local pharmacies and patent medicine shops without prescription, while 19.0% get home deliveries. Seventeen (80.9%) of the SCD subjects desired to discontinue the habit; however, inadequate medical support was reported to contribute to their inability to overcome this practice in 14 (54.3%) patients. Most of the local pharmacies/drug shop proprietors are aware of drug laws guiding controlled medicines in Nigeria. However, about 77.9% of pharmacies interviewed retail pentazocine without prescription. A lack of enforcement by the state and federal taskforce was reported to contribute to this practice. Conclusion. Pentazocine misuse is a serious problem in patients with SCD. Inadequate medical support and lack of enforcement of regulations on dispensing opioids by community pharmacies are contributors to this menace.",2022,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1
Analysis of the Water Leakage Rate from the Cells of Nursery Containers,substrate; container; Darcy's law; strain gauge; seedling; PICEA-GLAUCA SEEDLINGS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SPHAGNUM PEAT; GROWTH; MANAGEMENT; PERLITE,"In container production, the key issue is proper irrigation and fertilization. Typically, the water required for plant growth is supplied through an irrigation ramp system, which can also perform fertilization. The frequency of irrigation and the amount of water supplied by the ramp depends on several factors, such as the species of plants grown, the container used, the substrate, and atmospheric factors accompanying production. For effective irrigation, the substrate in the container cell must retain the supplied water long enough for plant absorption. However, any excess water should drain from the container. To optimize irrigation, it is important to determine the parameter of the water outflow speed from the container cell, which is difficult to determine. This work proposes a new solution for a station that can measure the water outflow speed from various container cells (patent application P.443675 2022). In tests, the water outflow speed was assessed for two Styrofoam container types (V150-650/312/150 mm, 74 cells, and 0.145 dm(3) cell volume; and V300-650/312/180 mm, 53 cells, and 0.275 dm(3) cell volume). Both were filled with a peat and perlite substrate (95/5%) using the Urbinati Ypsilon line (V150 substrate moisture 75.7 +/- 1.1%, and V300 75.9 +/- 2.1%, efficiency of the line 400 containers center dot h(-1), vibration intensity of the vibrating table-maximum acceleration 12 G). The results indicated that the water outflow speed varied between container types. The V300 container had a higher outflow speed (0.0344 cm center dot s(-1)) compared to the V150 (0.0252 cm center dot s(-1)). This discrepancy may be due to differences in dry bulk density, with a correlation of r = -0.523. The V300 had a lower actual and dry bulk density (0.418 g center dot cm(-3); 0.079 g center dot cm(-3)) compared to V150 (0.322 g center dot cm(-3); 0.103 g center dot cm(-3)). This highlights the need for individual selection of parameters on the backfilling line for different container types when filling. Using identical parameters for diverse containers can lead to varying substrate volume densities, impacting water outflow rates.",2023,Forestry,1
Whole-exome sequencing of pathogenic genes in a family with congenital heart disease: A case report,AMER1 gene; case report; congenital heart disease; KCNE1 gene; whole-exome sequencing; ,"Rationale: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and an important cause of noninfectious deaths in infants and children. It has high prevalence globally, placing an enormous burden on society and families. Studies of individuals with hereditary or sporadic CHD have provided strong evidence for its genetic basis. The aim of this study was to identify causative gene variants in a Chinese family with congenital heart disease. Patient concerns and diagnoses: Three generations of a CHD family were recruited. Proband III.9 was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at age 11 months, and the echocardiogram showed arterial ductus arteriosus, with a left-to-right shunt at the level of the arteries. Precedent III.10 was a twin of Proband III.9 who was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at age 11 months, in whom the echocardiogram revealed an arterial ductus arteriosus, an unenclosed patent ductus arteriosus, and a left to right shunt at the level of the arteries (second figure). III.8 was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at age 15, but echocardiography in this study showed no abnormalities. No cardiac abnormalities were detected in any of his parents, grandparents, or maternal grandparents. We performed whole-exome sequencing on CHD sufferers and their unexpressing family members to investigate the genetic causes of CHD in this family line. Exome sequencing identified 4 mutation sites in this family line. The variant c.3245A>G (p.His1082Arg) of the AMER1 gene was consistent with concomitant X-chromosome recessive inheritance, the variant c.238G>C (p.Val80Leu) of the KCNE1 gene was consistent with autosomal accessory inheritance, and the other 2 variants did not conform to the law of the mode of inheritance of the disease. Outcomes: The first identified variant, c.3245A>G (p.His1082Arg) of the AMER1 gene, with X-chromosome recessive inheritance, and the variant c.238G>C (p.Val80Leu) of the KCNE1 gene, which has been reported as autosomal dominant, may be the causative agent of CHD in this family line. These findings broaden the genetic scope of congenital heart disease and could help in the development of targeted drugs for the treatment of congenital heart disease.",2024,General & Internal Medicine,1
Review of Racial and Ethnic Representation of Participants Enrolled in Pediatric Clinical Trials of Oncology Drugs Conducted Through FDA Written Requests,; ,"Importance The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act states that in issuing a written request (WR), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shall consider the adequate representation (eg, proportionate to the disease population) of children from racial and ethnic minority populations. If the terms of the WR are fulfilled, the FDA may grant an additional 6 months of exclusivity for any unexpired patents and exclusivities attached to approved indications.Objective To report on the race and ethnicity of participants enrolled in pediatric studies conducted in response to WRs for which pediatric exclusivity was granted between 2001 and 2021.Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective review examines pediatric exclusivity request submissions for oncologic drugs that received pediatric exclusivity between December 2001 and January 2021 based on fulfillment of the requirements of a WR that were identified using the FDA's Document Archiving Reporting and Regulatory Tracking System. Demographic data were manually abstracted from supporting study reports, and data were pooled across submissions for the analysis. Data were analyzed throughout 2022 and 2023.Main Outcomes and Measures Representation by race, sex, and ethnicity in pediatric studies conducted in response to WRs.Results A total of 22 pediatric exclusivity requests were identified, comprising 40 studies and 2025 patients. Most trials (26 [65%]) in the analysis were cooperative group studies. Representation by race was as follows: American Indian/Alaska Native (13 [0.6%]), African American/Black (228 [11.3%]), Asian (92 [4.6%]), Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander (33 [1.6%]), White (1303 [64.3%]), other (194 [9.6%]), and unknown/not reported (162 [8.0%]). Representation by sex was female individuals (41.2%) and male individuals (58.8%). Ethnicity was as follows: Hispanic (226 [5.7%]), non-Hispanic (910 [22.5%]), unknown/not reported ethnicity (2800 [69.1%]), and other ethnicity (114 [2.8%]).Conclusions and Relevance The study results suggest that overall, representation of participants of racial and ethnic minority groups in studies supporting pediatric exclusivity requests appear comparable with the racial distribution of childhood cancers in the US based on data from the National Childhood Cancer Registry Explorer. However, fewer Hispanic participants were enrolled in the trials we reviewed (8%) compared with the representation of Hispanic patients in the National Childhood Cancer Registry (28%). This discrepancy may be partially explained by the large proportion of participants with unknown information regarding ethnicity. Further research into the reasons for the large proportion of participants with missing ethnicity information is needed.",2024,Oncology,1
Cost-effectiveness and impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV among men who have sex with men in Asia: A modelling study,; PROGRAM; PREP; RISK,"IntroductionMore than 70% of new HIV infections in Asia occurred in eight countries in 2020: Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam-with a rising incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for those at risk of acquiring HIV, yet wide-scale implementation of PrEP, on a daily or event-driven basis, has been limited in Asia. MethodsThe Optima HIV model was applied to examine the impact of scaling-up PrEP over five-years to cover an additional 15% of MSM compared with baseline coverage, a target deemed feasible by regional experts. Based on behavioral survey data, we assume that covering 15% of higher-risk MSM will cover 30% of all sexual acts in this group. Scenarios to compare the impact of generic-brand daily dosing of PrEP with generic event-driven dosing (15 days a month) were modelled from the start of 2022 to the end of 2026. Cost-effectiveness of generic versus branded PrEP was also assessed for China, the only country with an active patent for branded, higher cost PrEP. The impact on new HIV infections among the entire population and cost per HIV-related disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted were estimated from the beginning of 2022 to the end of 2031 and from 2022 to 2051. ResultsIf PrEP were scaled-up to cover an additional 15% of MSM engaging in higher-risk behavior from the beginning of 2022 to the end of 2026 in the eight Asian countries considered, an additional 100,000 (66,000-130,000) HIV infections (17%) and 300,000 (198,000-390,000) HIV-related DALYs (3%) could be averted over the 2022 to 2031 period. The estimated cost per HIV-related DALY averted from 2022 to 2031 ranged from US$600 for event-driven generic PrEP in Indonesia to US$34,400 for daily branded PrEP in Thailand. Over a longer timeframe from 2022 to 2051, the cost per HIV-related DALY averted could be reduced to US$100-US$12,700. ConclusionPrEP is a critical tool to further reduce HIV incidence in highly concentrated epidemics. Implementing PrEP in Asia may be cost-effective in settings with increasing HIV prevalence among MSM and if PrEP drug costs can be reduced, PrEP could be more cost-effective over longer timeframes.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1
Identifying absorbable bioactive constituents of Yupingfeng Powder acting on COVID-19 through integration of UPLC-Q/TOF-MS and network pharmacology analysis,COVID-19; network pharmacology; UPLC-Q; TOF-MS; Yupingfeng Powder; TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE; DRUG TARGET IDENTIFICATION; ASTRAGALOSIDE IV; WEB SERVER; RADIX; EXTRACT; POLYSACCHARIDES; PROFILES; WOGONIN; GAMMA,"Objective: Yupingfeng Powder (YPF), a kind of preventative patent medicine, is chosen for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to its high frequency application in respiratory tract diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, respiratory tract infections, and pneumonia, with the advantage of reducing the relapse rate and the severity. However, the active components of YPF and the mechanisms of components affecting COVID-19 are unclear. This study aimed to determine active constituents and elucidate its potential mechanisms. Methods: Ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLCQ/TOF-MS) and liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QQQ-MS) were used to determine the components and absorbable constituents of YPF. Secondly, TCMSP, Drugbank, Swiss and PharmMapper were used to search the targets of absorbable bioactive constituents of YPF, and the targets of COVID-19 were identified based on GeneCards and OMIM databases. STRING database was used to filter the possible inter-protein interactions. Thirdly, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis were performed to identify molecular function and systemic involvement of target genes. Results: A total of 61 components of YPF and 36 absorbable constituents were identified through UPLC-Q/ TOF-MS. Wogonin, prim-O-glucosylcimifugin, 5-O-methylvisamminol, astragaloside IV and 5-O- methylvisamminol (hydroxylation) were vital constituents for the treatment of COVID-19, and RELA, TNF, IL-6, MAPK14 and MAPK8ere recognized as key targets of YPF. The major metabolic reactions of the absorbed constituents of YPF were demethylation, hydroxylation, sulfation and glucuronidation. GO and KEGG pathway analysis further showed that the most important functions of YPF were T cell activation, response to molecule of bacterial origin, cytokine receptor binding, receptor ligand activity, cytokine activity, IL-17 signaling pathway, Chagas disease, lipid and atherosclerosis, etc. Conclusion: The approach of combining UPLC-Q/TOF-MS with network pharmacology is an effective tool to identify potentially bioactive constituents of YPF and its key targets on treatment of COVID-19.(c) 2022 Tianjin Press of Chinese Herbal Medicines.

Clinical application and economics of five short-acting combined oral contraceptives over five years of obstetrics and gynecology practice in China based on real-world study,Medication; Compound short-acting oral contraceptives; Obstetrics and gynecology; Big data; ESTRADIOL VALERATE; ETHINYL ESTRADIOL,"Objective: We aimed to better understand the clinical application and economics of five commonly used combined oral short-acting contraceptives (COCs) by analyzing big data collected from an obstetrics and gynecology hospital in China. The COCs studied included desogestrel ethinyl estradiol tablets (DSE), which was administered at a dose of 20 or 30 mu g ethinyl estradiol, ethinyl estradiol cyproterone tablets (ECP), drospirenone ethinyl estradiol tablets (DRE; 21 pills/box), and drospirenone ethinyl estradiol tablets (II; 28 pills/box). Methods: This retrospective study included patients who were prescribed COCs from 2014-2018 in our obstetrics and gynecology hospital, which is affiliated with Fudan University. We analyzed patient characteristics, clinical indications, drug costs, and types of drugs often prescribed with COCs to identify factors influencing medication choice and use. Results: Data from 127,183 patients using COCs was analyzed. The most commonly prescribed COCs was ECP, accounting for 64.16% of all COCs use, while DRE was the second most commonly prescribed (23.13%). Most patients were 21- to 30-year-old (56.82%). ECP, DSE (30 mu g), and DRE were most commonly used in the treatment of menstrual disorders, while DRE (II) was more frequently used for contraception. The second most common indication for DSE (30 mu g) use was endometriosis, while it was polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) for ECP and DRE. DSE (20 mu g) was used by only two patients in our study. The per capita cost of either dose of DSE was low: 34.95 +/- 5.34 RMB for the 30 mu g dose and 62.56 +/- 0.00 RMB for the 20 mu g dose. ECP was the second most affordable at a cost of 82.81 +/- 10.63 RMB, while DRE and DRE (II) were considerably more expensive at 186.88 +/- 23.88 and 265.98 +/- 22.12 RMB, respectively. The rank of the total cost of therapeutic drugs per capita was similar to that of COCs per capita. Either dose of DSE was cheapest, followed ECP. Again, DRE and DRE (II) were the most expensive. Metformin hydrochloride was the mostly commonly drug prescribed in conjunction with ECP; 39.89% of patients took both medications. Spironolactone tablets, other hormonal agents, and various Chinese patent medicines were also commonly prescribed with a COC. Conclusion: The main clinical indication for the prescription of COCs in our hospital has not been contraception, rather menstrual disorders and conditions characterized by excess androgen (e.g. PCOS). ECP entered the market the earliest in China, it is approved for the greatest number clinical indications, and it appears in the medical insurance catalogue of China. Thus, it is the most widely used COCs in China. In addition to contraception, it is also widely used to treat polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis. However, the 30 mu g dose of DSE is the most affordable in regards to total list price, and it is used for menstrual disorders, endometriosis, and contraception. Key Messages COCs are widely used in obstetrics and gynecology hospitals. They are not only a reliable method of contraception, but in China they are even more widely used to treat or manage a variety of other conditions. A total of five COCs are commonly used; each has advantages and disadvantages in regards to cost, when they were introduced in China, their presence in the medical insurance catalog, and the conditions they are commonly used to treat. At present, there are few published studies focusing on the clinical applications and economics of COCs in actual practice. In this study, we used big clinical data to explore the indications for use and drug economy of these key COCs. We thereby aimed to understand the decision-making process that occurs between doctor and patient to provide a theoretical basis for optimal treatment and resource allocation, while reducing the economic burden. Based on this data, we determined that compared to the available alternatives, ECP is the most commonly prescribed form of COC, which is most familiar to frontline while possessing the widest range of approved clinical indications. Although the 30 mu g dose of DSE is the most affordable, ECP runs a close second. Combined with its other attributes, it is not surprising ECP is widely prescribed.",2020,Obstetrics & Gynecology,1
Optimizing OCTG Thread Manufacturing Operation Using Automation,Artificial intelligence; advance robot direct interface controller; interface; rotation per minute; hexadecimal; interfacing technique tool machining robot; American standard code for information interchange; general user interface; autonomous computer numeric control; oil country tubular goods; ,"The paper discusses a unique technique developed initially at Nation Institute of Technology, Surat that is remodeled in real-world applications. The concept consists primarily of a user-friendly software facilitating direct communication with any intelligent or learning system/robot operating under known parameters of motor specifications. Any software base permitting high level PC interface without ASCII interrupt can be used for easy programming. This allows for a learning operation mode where a prevention of time lag is enabled by stored machine data, captured through movements such movements can be physically made or taught via programs to the device and such learning aspects make the machine more efficient where the robot can either perform individual actions as needed or learn new methods for the same results and can perform a series of actions continuously. Using the stored data, the machine is also capable of autonomous movements based on the path of least resistance as calculated by the time it takes to perform an act. Interfacing Technique Tool Machining Robot (ITTMR) was developed as robotic tool holder that can determine the shape and size of different OCTG pipes utilized in the downhole industry and enable it to machine appropriate threads on the pipe with no manual intervention. The process thereby completely negates any possibility of human error which can otherwise cause heavy loss on finished equipment that are rendered unusable because of threading errors on almost nearly finished complex milled parts or assemblies that are pending threads as the final operation. The purpose of the software codes is to provide a user-friendly GUI that can communicate with any machine by pulling in appropriate ACNC programs and performing the required tasks associated with the operating system and specifications of the motors/mobilization equipment's used. For the purpose of this paper, the software code is not provided. Any firmware base that permits the usage of an ASCII interrupt can be used and for the purpose of this operation, an RS323 equivalent board will also suffice for basic operations, however a complex ITTMR system has been utilized. This paper solely addresses the technique of how the threading operation is performed and does not address the process of how the pipe is bought to the machine or other associated aspects of the software to retain any possible patent applications on the same.",2021,Engineering,1
Hypogastric artery luminal diameter predicts common-external iliac stent patency and major adverse limb events in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease,Aortoiliac occlusive disease; iliac stent; internal iliac artery atherosclerosis; major adverse limb events; WALL SHEAR-STRESS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; MURRAYS LAW; STANDARDS; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; CONSENSUS; SOCIETY; LESIONS,"Objective Hypogastric coverage may be required for occlusive disease at the iliac arterial bifurcation. In this study, we sought to determine patency rates of common-external iliac artery (C-EIA) bare metal stents (BMS) spanning the hypogastric origin in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD). In addition, we sought to identify predictors of C-EIA BMS patency loss and major adverse limb events (MALE) in patients requiring hypogastric coverage. We hypothesized that worsening stenosis of the hypogastric origin would negatively influence C-EIA stent patency and freedom from MALE. Methods This is a single center, retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing elective, endovascular treatment of aortoiliac disease (AIOD) between 2010 and 2018. Only patients with C-EIA BMS coverage of a patent IIA origin were included in the study. Hypogastric luminal diameter was determined from preoperative CT angiography. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariable and multivariable logistic regression, and receiver operator characteristics (ROC). Results There were 236 patients (318 limbs) who were included in the study. AIOD was TASC C/D in 236/318 (74.2%) of cases. C-EIA stent primary patency was 86.5% (95% confidence interval: 81.1, 91.9) at 2 years and 79.7% (72.8, 86.7) at 4 years. Freedom from ipsilateral MALE was 77.0% (71.1, 82.9) at 2 years and 68.7% (61.3, 76.2) at 4 years. Luminal diameter of the hypogastric origin was most strongly associated with loss of C-EIA BMS primary patency in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio: 0.81, p = .02). Insulin-dependent diabetes, Rutherford's class IV or above, and stenosis of the hypogastric origin were significantly predictive of MALE in both univariable and multivariable analyses. In ROC analysis, luminal diameter of the hypogastric origin was superior to chance in prediction of C-EIA primary patency loss and MALE. Hypogastric diameter >4.5 mm had a negative predictive value of 0.94 for C-EIA primary patency loss and 0.83 for MALE. Conclusions Patency rates of C-EIA BMS are high. Hypogastric luminal diameter is an important and potentially modifiable predictor of C-EIA BMS patency and MALE in patients with AIOD.",2023,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,1
Approximation of the compression process to isothermal in a reciprocating compressor with a liquid piston,Reciprocating compressor; Piston pump; Liquid piston; Hybrid power machine; Cooling; Indicator efficiency; Flow rate; HEAT-TRANSFER; AIR; OIL; EFFICIENCY,"The implementation of the isothermal process of gas compression in the compressor increases the indicator efficiency up to 20%, which is a determining increase in their operation and saves a significant amount of energy and financial resources, as compressor units consume up to 10% of the energy consumed by production sector.Its implementation is possible in many ways: by changing the heat exchange surface (injection of coolant during compression), changing the heat transfer coefficient, changing the speed of gas compression, etc. The article considers a scheme for gas compression in a cylinder with a liquid piston having a variable speed to ensure an isothermal compression process, and a design of piston hybrid power machine, which brings the gas compression process closer to isothermal.According to theoretical studies, we determine the speed of the liquid piston for the implementation of the isothermal compression process, the amount of liquid required to supplied to the cylinder and the amount of liquid to be be drained from the pump into the gas cap. Using the method of mathematical modeling, according to the fundamental laws of conservation of energy, mass and motion, a mathematical model of a two-stage piston hybrid power machine with a liquid piston and a gas cap has been developed. The performance of the machine is verified by the created prototype, a test stand for its research and a series of experimental studies. As a result of the numerical experiment, we determined the physical picture of the processes in the machine, the absolute and relative flow rates of liquid into the gas cap and into the working cavity for isothermal compression process. The comparative analysis of the relative and absolute flow rates of the liquid and the instantaneous velocities of the piston identified areas by the angle of rotation where the isothermal compression process or close to it is carried out and where it is difficult.The performed parametric analysis verified that reducing the temperature of the walls and the diameter of the cylinder improves the implementing of the isothermal compression process. Using the findings, the results of the conducted patent analysis on the design features of the PHPM, we offered ways to implement the isothermal compression process, new two-stage PHPM designs with a liquid piston having high weight, size and energy indicators.",2022,Thermodynamics; Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics,1
Energy consumption and innovation-environmental degradation nexus in BRICS countries: new evidence from NARDL approach using carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions,Technological innovations; Energy consumption; NARDL; Institutional performance; BRICS countries; FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; CO2 EMISSIONS; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; TRADE OPENNESS; TIME-SERIES; IMPACT; INCOME; SUSTAINABILITY; GROWTH,"The BRICS nations-Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa-have grown significantly in importance over the past few decades, playing a vital role in the development and growth of the global economy. This expansion has not been without cost, either, since these countries' concern over environmental deterioration has risen sharply. Both researchers and decision-makers have focused a lot of attention on the connection between economic growth and ecological sustainability. By using nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach, the complex relationships were analyzed between important economic indicators-such as gross domestic product (GDP), ecological innovations (EI), energy consumption (ENC), institutional performance (IP), and trade openness (TOP)-and their effect on carbon emissions and nitrous oxide emissions in the BRICS countries from 1990 to 2021, this study seeks to contribute to this important dialog. Principal component analysis is formed for technological innovations and institutional performance using six (ICT service exports as a percentage of service exports, computer communications as a percentage of commercial service exports, fixed telephone subscriptions per 100 people, internet users as a percentage of the population, number of patent applications, and R&D expenditures as a percentage of GDP) and twelve (government stability, investment profile, socioeconomic conditions, internal conflict, external conflict, military in politics, control of corruption, religious tensions, ethnic tensions, law and order, bureaucracy quality, and democratic accountability) distinct indicators, respectively. The results of nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag estimation show that increase in economic growth would increase carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions. The positive and negative shocks in trade openness have positive and significant impact on carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in BRICS countries. Furthermore, the positive shock energy consumptions have positive and significant effect on Brazil and India when carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions are used. However, EKC exists in BRICS countries when carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions are used. According to long-term estimation, energy consumption and technological innovations in the BRICS countries show a strong and adverse link with nitrous oxide and a favorable relationship with carbon dioxide emissions. In the long run, environmental indicators are seen to have a major and unfavorable impact in BRICS nations. Finally, it is proposed that BRICS nations can assure environmental sustainability if they support creative activities, enhance their institutions, and support free trade policies.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1
Maritime Robotics and Autonomous Systems Operations: Exploring Pathways for Overcoming International Techno-Regulatory Data Barriers,robotic and autonomous systems; drones; crawlers; remotely operated vehicles; Internet of Robotic Things; data governance; user interface; international standards; DATA GOVERNANCE,"The current regulatory landscape that applies to maritime service robotics, aptly termed as robotics and autonomous systems (RAS), is quite complex. When it comes to patents, there are multifarious considerations in relation to vessel survey, inspection, and maintenance processes under national and international law. Adherence is challenging, given that the traditional delivery methods are viewed as unsafe, strenuous, and laborious. Service robotics, namely micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) or drones, magnetic-wheeled crawlers (crawlers), and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), function by relying on the architecture of the Internet of Robotic Things. The aforementioned are being introduced as time-saving apparatuses, accompanied by the promise to acquire concrete and sufficient data for the identification of vessel structural weaknesses with the highest level of accuracy to facilitate decision-making processes upon which temporary and permanent measures are contingent. Nonetheless, a noticeable critical issue associated with RAS effective deployment revolves around non-personal data governance, which comprises the main analytical focus of this research effort. The impetus behind this study stems from the need to enquire whether data provisions within the realm of international technological regulatory (techno-regulatory) framework is sufficient, well organized, and harmonized so that there are no current or future conflicts with promulgated theoretical dimensions of data that drive all subject matter-oriented actions. As is noted from the relevant expository research, the challenges are many. Engineering RAS to perfection is not the end-all and be-all. Collateral impediments must be avoided. A safety net needs to be devised to protect non-personal data. The results here indicate that established data decision dimensions call for data security and protection, as well as a consideration of ownership and liability details. An analysis of the state-of-the-art and the comparative results assert that the abovementioned remain neglected in the current international setting. The findings reveal specific data barriers within the existing international framework. The ways forward include strategic actions to remove data barriers towards overall efficacy of maritime RAS operations. The overall findings indicate that an effective transition to RAS operations requires optimizing the international regulatory framework for opening the pathways for effective RAS operations. Conclusions were drawn based on the premise that policy reform is inevitable in order to push the RAS agenda forward before the emanation of 6G and the era of the Internet of Everything, with harmonization and further standardization being very high priority issues.",2021,Engineering; Oceanography,1
Prognostic factors of time to first abortion after sexual debut among fragile state Congolese women: a survival analysis,Pregnancy; Unwanted; Unintended; Termination; Unsafe abortion; Women's health; ,"BackgroundDespite the common restrictive abortion laws, abortion remains widespread in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries. Women still utilize abortion services and put their lives and health at risk because abortion can only be procured illegally in private facilities such as mid-level or small patent medicine store that may be manned by unskilled providers or through a non-medicated approach. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of abortion, the reasons women had abortions, median years to first abortion after sexual debut and examine the factors of time to first abortion among women of reproductive age in the Republic of Congo.MethodsWe used data from the most recent Republic of Congo Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). A total sample of 3622 women aged 15-49years was analyzed. We estimated the overall prevalence of abortion and median years to first abortion. Furthermore, we examined the factors of time to first abortion after sexual debut using multivariable Cox regression and reported the estimates using adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical significance was determined at p<0.05.ResultsThe prevalence of abortion was 60.0% and median years of time to first abortion after sexual debut was 9.0. The prominent reasons for abortion were due to too short birth interval (23.8%), lack of money (21.0%) and that husband/partner did not need a child at that time (14.0%). Women's age and region were notable factors in timing to first abortion. Furthermore, women from poorer, middle, richer and richest households had 34, 67, 86 and 94% higher risk of abortion respectively, when compared with women from poorest households (all p <0.05). Women currently in union/living with a man and formerly in union had 41 and 29% reduction in the risk of abortion respectively, when compared with those never in union (all p <0.05). In addition, women with primary and secondary+ education had 42 and 76% higher risk of abortion respectively, when compared with women with no formal education (all p <0.05).ConclusionThere was high prevalence of abortion with short years at first abortion. Abortion was associated with women's characteristics. There is need for unwanted pregnancy prevention intervention and the improvement in pregnancy care to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes among women.",2021,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1

For other acute medical events such as cardiac arrest and stroke, research supports that the presence of a bystander is associated with better outcomes. Despite the similarities, however, this well-established conceptual framework has yet to be applied in the context of overdose patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess the association between the nature of the bystander-patient relationship and prehospital care measures in patients being treated for opioid overdose. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among adults who received naloxone in the prehospital setting for suspected opioid overdose. Patients were identified using a preexisting, longitudinal registry documenting all prehospital administrations of naloxone by first responders in a midsized community. Individuals who received at least one naloxone administration for a suspected opioid overdose between June 1st, 2016 to July 31st, 2018, with available EMS and medical record data were eligible for study inclusion. Bystander type was defined referencing psychology literature and were categorized as: close (spouse/family), proximal (friends), and distal (no relation to patient). The association between bystander type and prehospital patient care measures were estimated using logistic and linear regression models. Results: A total of 602 opioid overdose encounters among 545 patients were identified. Patents tended to be male (67.2%), white (73.6%), and aged 25-44 years (57.1%). Among patients with proximal bystanders present, average time to naloxone administration was 2.4 min less (95% CI = 4.6, -0.2), compared to distal bystanders, after adjusting for covariates. Overdose encounters with 911 dispatch codes more indicative of opioid overdose (i.e., 'overdose/poisoning' vs 'unconscious/fainting') were associated with having a close or proximal bystander present compared to a distal bystander (ORclose vs. distal = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.0, 3.3; ORproximal vs. distal = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.8, 7.1). Conclusion: Presence of a proximal bystander during an overdose event is associated with dispatch codes indicative of an overdose and shorter times to naloxone administration compared with those with distal bystanders. These findings offer opportunities for public education and engagement of overdose harm reduction strategies.",2021,"Emergency Medicine; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1

Modeling climate change's impact on the genetic diversity of domestic animals may help predict challenging situations. However, short life cycles and a lack of historical data for extended periods greatly compromise the evaluation of climate change effects. Preserving these domestic resources offers breeding alternatives for those seeking enhanced adaptability. From 1950 to 2019, the long-existing information and international character of the Hispano-Arabian horse breed made it an excellent model for studying other international populations. Wind speed, gust speed, or barometric pressure have greater impacts than extreme temperatures on genetic diversity. Extreme climate conditions may prompt breeders and owners to implement effective short- to medium-term strategies that enhance breed sustainability and the capacity to respond to extreme climate events in the long run. Domestic population preservation can catalyze regulatory changes occurring during breeds' climate change adaptive process and identify genes that confer greater adaptability while maintaining enhanced performance. This model aids in determining how owners should plan their breeding strategies to obtain more resilient animals adapted to climate-extreme conditions as an efficient alternative to increase profitability and ensure sustainability in these populations.Abstract The historical increase in the occurrence of extreme weather events in Spain during the last thirty years makes it a perfect location for the evaluation of climate change. Modeling the effects of climate change on domestic animals' genetic diversity may help to anticipate challenging situations. However, animal populations' short life cycle and patent lack of historical information during extended periods of time drastically compromise the evaluation of climate change effects. Locally adapted breeds' gene pool is the base for their improved resilience and plasticity in response to climate change's extreme climatic conditions. The preservation of these domestic resources offers selection alternatives to breeders who seek such improved adaptability. The Spanish endangered autochthonous Hispano-Arabian horse breed is perfectly adapted to the conditions of the territory where it was created, developed, and widespread worldwide. The possibility to trace genetic diversity in the Hispano-Arabian breed back around seven decades and its global ubiquity make this breed an idoneous reference subject to act as a model for other international populations. Climate change's shaping effects on the genetic diversity of the Hispano-Arabian horse breed's historical population were monitored from 1950 to 2019 and evaluated. Wind speed, gust speed, or barometric pressure have greater repercussions than extreme temperatures on genetic diversity. Extreme climate conditions, rather than average modifications of climate, may push breeders/owners to implement effective strategies in the short to medium term, but the effect will be plausible in the long term due to breed sustainability and enhanced capacity of response to extreme climate events. When extreme climatic conditions occur, breeders opt for mating highly diverse unrelated individuals, avoiding the production of a large number of offspring. People in charge of domestic population conservation act as catalyzers of the regulatory changes occurring during breeds' climate change adaptive process and may identify genes conferring their animals with greater adaptability but still maintaining enhanced performance. This model assists in determining how owners of endangered domestic populations should plan their breeding strategies, seeking the obtention of animals more resilient and adapted to climate-extreme conditions. This efficient alternative is focused on the obtention of increased profitability from this population and in turn ensuring their sustainability.",2024,Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,1
Xiaowugui decoction alleviates experimental rheumatoid arthritis by suppressing Rab5a-mediated TLR4 internalization in macrophages,Rheumatoid arthritis; Rab5a; Internalization of TLR4; Xiaowugui decoction; Macrophage; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; NF-KAPPA-B; REGULATORY FACTOR-3; INFLAMMATION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; INDUCTION; PATHWAYS,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by exacerbated synovial inflammation and joint destruction. Recent studies suggest toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) internalization facilitate inflammatory response of macrophage. The role of TLR4 internalization in the pathogenesis of RA is unknown. Purpose: To investigate the role and mechanism of TLR4 internalization in macrophage inflammatory response of RA and explore whether TLR4 internalization mediates the anti-arthritic effect of Xiaowugui (XWG) decoction, a patented herbal formula used in China. Methods: The co-expression of TLR4 and the internalization marker, early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), in the synovial samples of RA patients and joint tissue of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, were evaluated using immunofluorescence. The effect of Rab5a-mediated early internalization of TLR4 on the activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in RAW264.7 cells was investigated using small interfering RNAs that act against Rab5a. CIA was induced in Rab5a-/- mice to evaluate the role of Rab5a in vivo. The disease progression and expression of Rab5a and TLR4 in the joint tissue were evaluated in CIA mice treated with XWG. Inflammatory factors production, TLR4 internalization, and activation of downstream signaling pathways were examined in RAW264.7 cells treated with XWG in vitro. Results: The co-expression and co-localization of TLR4 and EEA1 were elevated in the synovial samples of RA patients and joint tissue of CIA mice. Pharmaceutical inhibition of TLR4 internalization reduced macrophages inflammatory responses induced by LPS. The co-expression and co-localization of Rab5a and TLR4 were significantly increased in macrophages treated with LPS. Silencing Rab5a reduced LPS-induced TLR4 internalization, inflammatory factors production, and phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p65. Genetic deletion of Rab5a inhibited TLR4 internalization and the development of arthritis in vivo. The co-expression of TLR4 and Rab5a was also elevated in the synovial samples of RA patients. XWG treatment of mice with CIA alleviated arthritis and reduced the co-expression of Rab5a and TLR4 in the joint tissue. XWG treatment of macrophage inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-alpha production, co-expression of Rab5a and TLR4, and phosphorylation of JNK and p65. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the pathogenic role of TLR4 internalization in patients with RA and identify a novel Rab5a-dependent internalization pathway that promotes macrophage inflammatory response. XWG treatment demonstrated outstanding therapeutic effects in experimental arthritis, and targeting the Rab5amediated internalization of TLR4 may be the main underlying mechanism.",2024,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1

Constructing a functional tissue that incorporates two-dimensional (2D) or higher dimensions requires overcoming technological or biological limitations in order to orchestrate the structural compilation of one-dimensional and 2D sheets (microstructures) simultaneously (in situ). This approach enables the creation of a layered structure that can be referred to as an ensemble of layers or, after several days of maturation, a direct or indirect joining of layers. Here, we have avoided providing a detailed methodological description of three-dimensional and 2D strategies, except for a few interesting examples that highlight the higher alignment of cells and emphasize rarely remembered facts associated with vascular, peripheral nerve, muscle, and intestine tissues. The effective directionality of cells in conjunction with geometric cues (in the range of micrometers) is well known to affect a variety of cell behaviors. The curvature of a cell's environment is one of the factors that influence the formation of patterns within tissues. The text will cover cell types containing some level of stemness, which will be followed by their consequences for tissue formation. Other important considerations pertain to cytoskeleton traction forces, cell organelle positioning, and cell migration. An overview of cell alignment along with several pivotal molecular and cellular level concepts, such as mechanotransduction, chirality, and curvature of structure effects on cell alignments will be presented. The mechanotransduction term will be used here in the context of the sensing capability that cells show as a result of force-induced changes either at the conformational or the organizational levels, a capability that allows us to modify cell fate by triggering downstream signaling pathways. A discussion of the cells' cytoskeleton and of the stress fibers involvement in altering the cell's circumferential constitution behavior (alignment) based on exposed scaffold radius will be provided. Curvatures with size similarities in the range of cell sizes cause the cell's behavior to act as if it was in an in vivo tissue environment. The revision of the literature, patents, and clinical trials performed for the present study shows that there is a clear need for translational research through the implementation of clinical trial platforms that address the tissue engineering possibilities raised in the current revision.This article is categorized under:Infectious Diseases > Biomedical EngineeringNeurological Diseases > Biomedical EngineeringCardiovascular Diseases > Biomedical Engineering",2023,Research & Experimental Medicine,1
"Use of Methylene Blue Dye for Lymphatic Basin Mapping and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients in Enugu, Nigeria",Axillary dissection; breast cancer; methylene blue dye; sentinel node; NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY; AXILLARY DISSECTION; SURGERY; VALIDATION; SUBAREOLAR; MANAGEMENT; INJECTION,"Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the current standard of care for axillary staging and further treatment planning in patients with clinical axillary node-negative breast cancer. Sentinel node (SN) biopsy was designed to accurately stage the axilla and minimize the side effects of conventional axillary-lymph-node dissection without sacrificing oncologic outcomes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is normally performed with nuclear scan and patent blue violet or isosulfan blue. These are expensive and not commonly available in resource-poor regions such as West Africa. Methylene blue dye is a commonly used agent in a wide range of clinical diagnostic procedures and has been used by other investigators to perform this procedure. This study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of SN biopsy in the management of axillary node-negative breast cancer in resource-limited populations using methylene blue dye. Aim: To determine the efficacy of methylene blue dye as a single tracer in lymphatic basin mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with clinical axillary node-negative breast cancer. Methods: This was a prospective, case-controlled study involving 28 consecutively presenting female patients with clinical axillary node-negative breast cancer at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu. Each of the patients had lymphatic basin mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy with a sub-areola-subdermal injection of methylene blue dye. The SN (s) were then removed using the dye as the marker. Each patient then had a mastectomy or wide local excision as appropriately planned and conventional levels I and II axillary dissection was performed in the same sitting. The SNs and other axillary nodes were reviewed independently by our institution's pathologist. Each patient's axillary dissection specimen acted as her control for the study. Results: The SNs were identified in 24 (85.7%) patients. There was a demonstrable learning curve with an improvement in identification rate in the later half of the cases (92.9%) compared to the earlier half of the cases (78.6%). A range of 1-3 nodes and a mean of 1.78 nodes were obtained. A sensitivity of 90.9%, specificity of 79.6%, false-positive rate of 28.6%, false-negative rate of 9.1%, and accuracy of 95.8% were obtained. There was no incidence of allergic/hypersensitivity reaction. Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy with methylene blue dye can be applied with high accuracy within resource-limited environments. However, there is a definite short learning curve that must be overcome and the procedure validated before clinical application in decision-making.",2022,General & Internal Medicine,1
Policies to promote breeding for lice-resistant salmon: Incentives designed for resilient and sustainable growth in aquaculture,Atlantic salmon; fish welfare; genetic resistance; policy instruments; regulation; salmon lice; selective breeding; GENETIC-RESOURCES; PROTECTION; ACCESS; EFFICIENCY,"Sea lice represent a persistent and growing problem, challenging the resilience and growth of the salmon aquaculture industry. In this Norwegian case study, we studied and discuss how the absence of policy instruments directed at stimulating breeding for lice resistance (LR) might be explained. We found well-documented opportunities for selection progress for LR. Hence, breeding on LR appears with an untapped potential. We discuss how market-based, legal, institutional and interest-based factors can explain the absence of policy instruments stimulating LR breeding. Methodologically, we obtained data from document and literature studies and interviews with key players (salmon breeders, farmers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and governmental bodies in Norway). First, LR is a polygenic trait, which makes it poorly suited for patenting. Furthermore, if only a small proportion of fish farmers choose seeds with higher LR, other operators can easily take on the free-rider role because they will not suffer from reduced gain in growth performance as a result of a much stronger emphasis on LR in the breeding goal. The market is thus not expected to stimulate stronger selection for LR in Norwegian salmon breeding. Second, neither genetic engineering (e.g., gene editing), still struggling with consumer acceptance, nor the uncertainty associated with possible changes in the Norwegian Gene Technology Act stimulate investment in LR via, for example, CRISPR technology. Thirdly, public policy instruments in their entirety have targeted other types of innovations against salmon lice, and none have so far been used to stimulate breeding companies to emphasize LR more strongly in their breeding programmes. From a political point of view, it seems that breeding has been left to the market and the private sector. However, neither the NGOs nor the public seem to be aware of, or pay significant attention to, the breeding potential to improve LR and fish welfare. Fragmented management of the aquaculture sector can camouflage the close ties between political and business interests. The industry is hesitant to invest significantly in long-term breeding targets such as significantly higher genetic LR. This may strengthen the assumption that strong economic interests will reduce the role of science in knowledge-based management. As farmed salmon are increasingly being exposed to stressful delousing treatments, mortality and associated welfare problems have increased significantly. For instance, large fish die more often from cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS), resulting in growing demand for CMS-resistant salmon. This gives rise to a paradoxical situation: increasing treatments with high mortality and fish welfare issues in farmed salmon, while the lice threat to wild salmon persists.",2023,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,1
A discovery of clinically approved Panlongqi Tablet for repositioning to treat osteoarthritis by inhibiting PI3K/AKT activation,Network pharmacology; Osteoarthritis; Panlongqi Tablet (PLQT); Inflammation; Cartilage; Subchondral bone; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; CHONDROCYTES; SYNOVITIS; PERLECAN; PATHWAY,"Background: Panlongqi Tablet (PLQT) is a Chinese patent drug composed of 29 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines. Clinical practice has shown that PLQT can relieve osteoarthritis-caused joint pain, but its effects and mechanisms in other pathological links of osteoarthritis have not been characterized. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to reposition the pharmacodynamic effects of PLQT through network pharmacology analysis combined with experimental validation, and also to preliminarily explore its possible mechanism. Methods: On the basis of integrating the relevant targets of PLQT in multiple drug databases and osteoarthritis-related targets in the disease database, an interaction network of related genes was constructed. The hub candidate targets of PLQT in the treatment of osteoarthritis were determined by calculating the main network topological characteristics, The specific functions and pathways of these targets acting on osteoarthritis were modularly analyzed. In addition, the modified Hulth-induced rat model of osteoarthritis and IL-1 beta-induced in vitro model of osteoarthritis were established to further validate the potential efficacy and possible mechanism of PLQT. Results: A total of 138 key targets related to osteoarthritis were selected based on topological parameters, and their biological functions were mainly enriched in four over-expressed modules of cartilage degeneration, inflammatory response, immune response, and subchondral bone metabolism. The hub candidate targets had the highest enrichment degree in the TLR4-RAC1-PIK3CA-Akt-NF kappa B signaling axis of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In vivo results showed that PLQT treatment significantly inhibited the degeneration of proteoglycan and collagen in the cartilage of osteoarthritis rats, suppressed chondrocyte apoptosis, and reduced the Mankin score of joints. Moreover, PLQT alleviated synovial inflammation, reduced the Krenn score of synovium, inhibited the formation of osteophytes in osteoarthritis rats, reduced the bone mineral density (BMD), fractional bone volume (BV/TV), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.), as well as increased the trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.) of subchondral bone and the thickness of the subchondral bone plate (SBP.Th.). PLQT suppressed the expressions of TLR4, RAC1, PIK3CA, p-Akt, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 in the cartilage, and inhibited the expression of NF kappa B p65 in the chondrogenic nucleus. Meanwhile, as downstream effector factors of the predictive pathways, the levels of serum interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) were decreased after PLQT treatment. In vitro results also showed that PLQT could inhibit the expression of key proteins and downstream effector factors of the signaling axis, and this inhibition disappeared when pathway agonists were added. Conclusion: PLQT exerted pharmacological effects on the key pathological links of osteoarthritis including chondrocyte apoptosis, extracellular matrix degradation, inflammation, and subchondral bone metabolism by inhibiting the TLR4-RAC1-PIK3CA-Akt-NF kappa B axis-related proteins.",2022,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1
A novel mechanism for regulating lung immune homeostasis: Zukamu granules alleviated acute lung injury in mice by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and regulating Th17/Treg cytokine balance,Immune homeostasis; Acute lung injury; NLRP3 inflammasome; Pyroptosis; Th17/ Treg balance; Zukamu granules; NETWORK PHARMACOLOGY; PREDICTION,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severely acute lung inflammation with high morbidity and mortality. Zukamu granules (ZKMG) is one of the Uygur patent drugs commonly used in clinic, which is included in the National Essential Drugs List (2018 edition). Clinical studies have shown that ZKMG has a significant effect on acute upper respiratory tract infection, and has better anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects. However, the immunomodulatory mechanism of ZKMG on ALI is still not clear. Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to investigate the lung protective effect and immunomodulatory mechanism of ZKMG on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced ALI mice, and to provide an important basis for the treatment strategy and theoretical basis of ALI. Materials and methods: First, network pharmacology was used to predict the potential signaling pathways and biological processes of ZKMG related to immunology. Molecular docking technique was used to predict the possibility between the core components of ZKMG acting on NLRP3 protein. In addition, protein levels of F4/80 in lung tissues were assessed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The contents of IL-1 beta, IL-18, IL-17A and IL-10 in the lung tissue and serum, MPO in the lung tissue were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis (RT-qPCR) was used to detect NLRP3 mRNA in lung tissue. Protein levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, Cleaved caspase-1 p20, ASC, and GSDMD were detected by Western blot (WB). Results: The results of network pharmacology showed that the immune pathways of ZKMG were mainly Th17 signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, etc. Molecular docking results showed that the core components of ZKMG had good binding ability to NLRP3 protein. The verification experiments showed that ZKMG can reduce the degree of lung injury, and reduce the level of inflammatory infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages by reducing the content of MPO and F4/80. In addition, ZKMG can reduce NLRP3 mRNA, inhibit the expression of NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD and other related pathway proteins, and reduce inflammatory factors such as IL-1 beta and IL-18. It can also reduce the content of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A, increase the content of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in lung tissue. Conclusion: ZKMG can reduce the degree of lung tissue injury in ALI by inhibiting NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway and restoring the IL-17A/IL-10 cytokine balance, and its protective mechanism may be related to the regulation of lung immune homeostasis. It will provide a new strategy for studying the regulation of lung immune homeostasis.",2024,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,1
Improving Implementation of an Electronic Prescription System for COVID-19 Vaccination in the Czech Republic: Process Modeling Approach,eHealth; electronic prescription; process modeling; state diagram; COVID-19; vaccination; vaccine; medical; communication; platform; ,"Background: It is very difficult to find a consensus that will be accepted by most players when creating health care legislation. The Czech electronic prescription system was launched in 2011 and new functions were introduced in 2018. To ensure that these functions will not conflict with any other existing law, a process modeling tool based on the patent Method and system for automated requirements modeling was used successfully in the Czech Republic for the first time.Objective: The aim of this project was to develop another successful application of process modeling to add COVID-19 vaccination records to the existing electronic prescription system.Methods: The method employed was based on the mathematical theory of hierarchical state diagrams and process models. In the first step, sketches that record the results of informal discussions, interviews, meetings, and workshops were prepared. Subsequently, the architecture containing the main participants and their high-level interactions was drafted. Finally, detailed process diagrams were drawn. Each semiresult was discussed with all involved team members and stakeholders to incorporate all comments. By repeating this procedure, individual topics were gradually resolved and the areas of discussion were narrowed down until reaching complete agreement.Results: This method proved to be faster, clearer, and significantly simpler than other methods. Owing to the use of graphic tools and symbols, the risk of errors, inaccuracies, and misunderstandings was significantly reduced. The outcome was used as an annex to the bill in the legislative process. One of the main benefits of this approach is gaining a higher level of understanding for all parties involved (ie, legislators, the medical community, patient organizations, and information technology professionals). The process architecture model in a form of a graphic scheme has proven to be a valuable communication platform and facilitated negotiation between stakeholders. Moreover, this model helped to avoid several inconsistencies that appeared during workshops and discussions. Our method worked successfully even when participants were from different knowledge areas.Conclusions: The vaccination record process model was drafted in 3 weeks and it took a total of 2 months to pass the bill. In comparison, the initial introduction of the electronic prescription system using conventional legislative methods took over 1 year, involving immediate creation of a text with legislative intent, followed by paragraph-by-section wording of the legislation that was commented on directly. These steps are repeated over and over, as any change in any part of the text has to be checked and rechecked within the entire document. Compared with conventional methods, we have shown that using our method for the process of modification of legislation related to such a complex issue as the integration of COVID-19 vaccination into an electronic prescription model significantly simplifies the preparation of a legislative standard.(JMIR Form Res 2023;7:e41575) doi: 10.2196/41575",2023,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,1
The signaling value of legal form in entrepreneurial debt financing,Legal form; Minimum capital requirements; Signaling; Access to debt; Financial constraints; CREDIT MARKETS; CONSTRAINTS; PATENTS; RISK; ENTRY; AVAILABILITY; EQUILIBRIUM; COMPETITION; VALUATION; FOUNDERS,"This study examines the impact of mandatory legal form choices on startups' debt financing opportunities. We posit that an entrepreneur's initial legal form decision serves as a reliable signal to outside lenders, reducing adverse selection concerns. Using data from German startups, we find that limited liability companies with low capital requirements disproportionately secure less debt than their high -capital counterparts. This financing disparity is particularly pronounced for younger firms in areas dominated by small relationship banks, but it diminishes with firm age. Our findings highlight the unintended consequences of recent global deregulation efforts. Executive summary: Formal debt financing is arguably the most important source of external financing for startups. Despite its importance, many startups find it challenging to secure such financing due to informational opacity: they lack the track record or publicly available evidence needed to prove that they are a sound investment. This raises a pressing question: How can startups credibly convey their creditworthiness to potential lenders? We posit that a startup entrepreneur's choice of legal form acts as a pivotal signal to potential lenders, allowing them to differentiate between high -risk and low -risk ventures. Every startup must decide what legal form it will adopt at incorporation. Unlike most other, industry -specific decisions, the choice of legal form acts as a consistent and universally applicable signal. Moreover, recent shifts in global regulations have seen the emergence of companies with low -capital legal forms, a development further underscoring the importance of studying these choices (World Bank, 2020). We theorize that adopting a legal form with high minimum paid -in capital requirements signals that a venture will be less likely to default on a loan: entrepreneurs who anticipate a higher likelihood of default will be less inclined to pick a legal form with high minimum capital requirements since they would be liable for the amount of paid -in capital in the case of bankruptcy. The opportunity costs of such a choice would also be higher as founding a high -capital firm would entail foregoing alternative, safer investment opportunities. Furthermore, the reputational costs and potential stigma of failure associated with defaulting when choosing a high- versus lowcapital legal form may induce high -risk types to choose the latter. Importantly, we posit that the legal form choice has signaling value beyond the amount of paid -in capital: among firms with the same amount of equity and similar firm and founder characteristics, those ventures with a low -capital legal form have more difficulty in attracting the necessary external funding. We utilize comprehensive administrative and survey data from German firms to empirically test our hypotheses. In 2008, Germany introduced the mini-LLC or low -capital LLC, allowing founders to opt for a lower minimum capital requirement than the traditional 25,000 Euro. This shift presented a unique opportunity to study the implications of legal form choice on external financing. Our findings suggest that low -capital LLCs typically secure less debt and more frequently experience financial constraints, despite the lack of any significant difference between their financing needs and those of high-capital LLCs. We further demonstrate that the total effect consists of a mild positive intentional impact from choosing a high-capital legal form and a strong negative unintentional impact from opting for a low -capital form. Notably, these signaling effects are more pronounced for smaller, relationship banks, which tend to rely more on nonfinancial cues for risk assessment due to their limited access to sophisticated financial evaluation tools. As the firm -bank relationship matures, the weight of this signal diminishes, indicating that banks adjust their assessment based on acquired knowledge of the firm's quality. However, larger, transactional banks, which focus more on hard data, tend to maintain their reliance on this signal for extended periods. For entrepreneurs, the key takeaway is that a trade-off exists between capital requirements and debt accessibility. The stigma tied to low-capital legal forms disproportionately affects their ability to secure debt. Opting for a legal form with low capital requirements might be advantageous to those not heavily dependent on external financing in the early stages, and fostering longstanding relationships with banks is one way of mitigating the unintended consequences of choosing a low-capital legal structure. Entrepreneurs should consider the prevalent banking landscape in their regions; in areas dominated by smaller banks, the legal form choice is especially crucial. For policymakers, the implications are clear. Regulations regarding firm incorporation can unintentionally impact startups' access to external funding, potentially stifling growth. Understanding these dynamics when formulating policies that shape the entrepreneurial landscape is essential.",2024,Business & Economics,1
The theory of technological response and progress in chaos,Grounded theory; Chaos theory; COVID-19; Technological response; Theory of technological response and progress in chaos; ,"PurposeThis study aims to develop the first Theory of Technological Response and Progress in Chaos (TRPC) and examine the case of technological development during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research objectives of this study were to: identify the key technologies that act as a response mechanism during the chaos event, specifically in the case of COVID-19; examine how technologies evolve, develop and diffuse in an immediate crisis and a chaotic environment; theorise various types and periods of technological response and progress during the emergence of chaos and the stages that unfold; and develop policy-oriented recommendations and establish technological foundations to address subsequent chaos events. Design/methodology/approachThis study used the grounded theory as a methodology with a mixed-method approach that included quantitative and qualitative methods. The authors used the quantitative method to assist with the qualitative step to build the TRPC theory. Accordingly, this study integrated machine learning and text mining approaches to the qualitative data analysis following the steps of the grounded theory approach. FindingsAs a result of the TRPC theory development process, the authors identified three types of technologies (survival, essential and enhancement technologies) and five types of periods (stable, initial, survival-dominant, essential-dominant and enhancement-dominant periods) that are specific to chaos-technology interactions. The policy implications of this study demonstrate that a required technological base and know-how must be established before a chaotic event emerges. Research limitations/implicationsConcerning the limitations of this study, social media data has advantages over other data sources, such as the examination of dynamic areas and analyses of immediate responses to chaos. However, other researchers can examine publications and patent sources to augment the findings concerning scientific approaches and new inventions in relation to COVID-19 and other chaos-specific developments. The authors developed the TRPC theory by studying the COVID-19 pandemic, however, other researchers can utilise it to study other chaos-related conditions, such as chaotic events that are caused by natural disasters. Other scholars can investigate the technological response and progress pattern in other rapidly emerging chaotic events of an uncertain and complex nature to augment these findings. Practical implicationsFollowing the indications of the OECD (2021a) and considering the study conducted by the European Parliamentary Research Service (Kritikos, 2020), the authors identified the key technologies that are significant for chaos and COVID-19 response using machine learning and text intelligence approach. Accordingly, the authors mapped all technological developments using clustering approaches, and examined the technological progress within the immediate chaos period using social media data. Social implicationsThe key policy implication of this study concerns the need for policymakers to develop policies that will help to establish the required technological base and know-how before chaos emerges. As a result, a rapid response can be implemented to mitigate the chaos and transform it into a competitive advantage. The authors also revealed that this recommendation overlaps with the model of dynamic capabilities in the literature (Teece and Pisano, 2003). Furthermore, this study recommends that nations and organisations establish a technological base that specifically includes technologies that bear 3A characteristics. These are the most crucial technologies for the survival- and essential-dominant stages. Moreover, the results of this study demonstrate that chaos accelerates technological progress through the rapid adoption and diffusion of technologies into different fields. Hence, nations and organisations should regard this rapid progress as an opportunity and establish the prior knowledge base and technologies before chaos emerges. Originality/valueThe authors have contributed to the chaos studies and the relationship between chaos and technological development by establishing the first theoretical foundation using the grounded theory approach, hereafter referred to as the TRPC theory. As part of the TRPC theory, the authors present three periods of technological response in the following sequence: survival technology, essential technology and enhancement technology. Moreover, this study illustrates the evolving technological importance and priorities as the periods of technological progress proceed under rapidly developing chaos.",2023,Public Administration,1

Therefore, study of the movement of this joint (flexion and extension) is a significant matter of interest. To date, fetlock joint angle pattern and range of motion in horses have been quantified using optical motion capture (OMC). These systems use a number of cameras to film the subject and reconstruct the movement trajectories into a computer model. They are very accurate and precise but require expensive equipment and a laboratory setting. The use of inertial measurement unit (IMU) systems in the field of motion analysis is now widespread. IMU systems use a number of sensors in order to derive the position of the body in the space; they have the advantage of being able to collect kinematic spatio-temporal data when the animal is moving overground with fewer constraints than in a gait lab. To the authors' best knowledge there are no studies using IMUs sensors in order to record relative fetlock joint angles in horses moving overground. In this study, we wanted first to validate the use of IMUs for kinematic detection of fetlock joint movement on the sagittal axis comparing it to the OMC. Then, we intended to discuss fetlock joint range of motion variability quantified by the IMU system under investigation in lame and sound horses. The IMU system was able to record fetlock joint range of motion just as does the bi-dimensional OMC at walk and trot, in both sound and lame horses. IMU system quantification of fetlock joint range of motion confirmed that the variability was mainly due to lameness in our population of horses. Quantifying joint angle patterns with an IMU system instead of using OMC has the advantage of furnishing real-time bio-feedback of kinematic data. The system can handle various equine gaits and clinical and training conditions outside of expensive laboratory circumstances. Fetlock joint angle (FJA) pattern is a sensitive indicator of lameness. The first aim of this study is to describe a network of inertial measurement units system (IMUs) for quantifying FJA simultaneously in all limbs. The second aim is to evaluate the accuracy of IMUs for quantifying the sagittal plane FJA overground in comparison to bi-dimensional (2-D) optical motion capture (OMC). 14 horses (7 free from lameness and 7 lame) were enrolled and analyzed with both systems at walk and trot on a firm surface. All enrolled horses were instrumented with 8 IMUs (a pair for each limb) positioned at the dorsal aspect of the metacarpal/metatarsal bone and pastern and acquiring data at 200 Hz. Passive markers were glued on the center of rotation of carpus/tarsus, fetlock, and distal interphalangeal joint, and video footages were captured at 60 Hz and digitalized for OMC acquisition. The IMU system accuracy was reported as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The Granger Causality Test (GCT) and the Bland-Altman analysis were computed between the IMUs and OMC patterns to determine the agreement between the two systems. The proposed IMU system was able to provide FJAs in all limbs using a patented method for sensor calibration and related algorithms. Fetlock joint range of motion (FJROM) variability of three consecutive strides was analyzed in the population through 3-way ANOVA. FJA patterns quantified by IMUs demonstrated high accuracy at the walk (RMSE 8.23 degrees +/- 3.74 degrees; PCC 0.95 +/- 0.03) and trot (RMSE 9. 44 degrees +/- 3.96 degrees; PCC 0.96 +/- 0. 02) on both sound (RMSE 7.91 degrees +/- 3.19 degrees; PCC 0.97 +/- 0.03) and lame horses (RMSE 9.78 degrees +/- 4.33 degrees; PCC 0.95 +/- 0.03). The two systems' measurements agreed (mean bias around 0) and produced patterns that were in temporal agreement in 97.33% of the cases (p < 0.01). The main source of variability between left and right FJROM in the population was the presence of lameness (p < 0.0001) and accounted for 28.46% of this total variation. IMUs system accurately quantified sagittal plane FJA at walk and trot in both sound and lame horses.",2022,Veterinary Sciences,1
The role of intellectuals in times of pandemic: understanding Noam Chomsky's political activism,Noam Chomsky; intellectual engagement; political activism; pandemic; ethos; ,"This article aims to analyze the role of intellectuals in times of a global pandemic, whereby their discourse is assumed as a counterbalance to the hegemony of experts. It takes as a case study several exemplar speeches by Noam Chomsky, linguist and political activist, which were produced since the beginning of March 2020 regarding Covid-19. We will try to show that what marks Chomsky's discourse is related to the ethos (Maingueneau 2020) of an intellectual engagement (Bourdieu 2003). Within the universe of possibilities for choosing intellectuals' speeches, who are not necessarily convergent on topics affecting the world, and who, in general, don't talk about the same things, we chose to circumscribe our research on a specific intellectual: Noam Chomsky. In our view, he is an actual example of intellectual action, representing properly the relations between intellectuals and power (Bobbio 1997). Therefore, it is necessary to understand the statements of intellectuals like Chomsky in moments of global uncertainty, and as a discourse of a different nature that stands against the experts' power in major media corporations or in government technocracy. Thus, far from wanting to exhaust the possibilities of interpreting the role of the wider category of intellectuals during the pandemic, our proposal is to outline the main points of how an intellectual like Chomsky has been developing and taking the same political positions since the beginning of his activism, in the 1960s, which refers to a type of intellectual engagement similar to that taken since the Dreyfus Affair. In the Dreyfus Affair we have an inaugural archetype of the concept of an engaged intellectual (Bourdieu 2003, p. 73-74), from which the one who has social capital as an erudite, a scientist or a writer, comes out publicly criticizing the established powers and denounces crimes committed by the reasons of State (Chomsky 1973). Therefore, we understand that Chomsky comes from a lineage whose representatives are inserted into a form of intellectual activism; a lineage that became known as the century of intellectuals (Winock 2000), the intellectual conceived as the one who tells the truth, as Chomsky (1996, p. 55) himself define the intellectual's responsibility: At one level, the answer is too easy: the intellectual responsibility of the writer, or any decent person, is to tell the truth. On the one hand, there is a patent argument of authority behind the experts, based on a scientific discourse, but, on the other hand, there is a kind of moral commitment to the truth behind the intellectuals' discourse that becomes a deeper criticism. That is, a holistic view to ponder, in the case of Covid-19, the humanitarian problems created due to the pandemic, but also to think about relating this crisis to previous and further geopolitical reasons, from a freer position, not committed to companies and States. This position of the intellectual engagement is idealized in opposition to the normal science discourse: the genre of the scientific discourse is produced under official means; it is plastered, blunted, does not allow the spokespeople of science to speak beyond what their research allows. In other words, the scientific experts are inscribed in discursive structures of scenes of enunciation (Maingueneau, 2006) that don't permit them to surpass the barriers of objectiveness and enter the field of moral judgment. Seeking to understand how Chomsky acts as an engaged intellectual during the pandemic, we searched his political network and the media in which he is involved. From that, we chose our corpus of analysis, selected from Noam Chomsky's innumerous speeches to a left-wing or clearly progressive press during the first months of Covid-19 pandemic in the form of interviews from March to June: an interview to Michael Brooks (2020), at the Jacobin Magazine (Brooks, M. 2020); an interview with his longtime interviewer, David Barsamian (2020), an Armenian-American journalist and political activist, published on the website Literary Hub; an interview with the British socialist newspaper Morning Star (2020); two interviews he gave to Amy Goodman (2020a, 2020b) for the American journal Democracy Now; an interview with the Croatian philosopher Srecko Horvat (2020), from which we will use only the parts of the transcript that we found published by Al Jazeera and not the video; an interview to the writer Chris Brooks to the magazine Labor Notes, channel for the proletarian movement; an interview to Cristina Magdaleno (2020) for the Euroactiv, a non-profit organization for democracy in European Union, as well as an interview Chomsky and Robert Pollin gave to C. J. Polychroniou (2020). We believe that through this corpus it is possible to cover the vast majority of Chomsky's speeches on the Covid-19 pandemic, centered on media where Chomsky usually features and that name themselves as having a more progressive bias. We assume that what gives Chomsky's speech authority to talk about the pandemic, to be invited multiple times to do so, is not his expertise in the subject; it is not his background in epidemiology studies, which he lacks, neither his linguistics theories, that do not relate to the topic, but his image as a great surviving intellectual. It's to say, what authorizes Chomsky to speak and, therefore, to make his contribution to the studies of this pandemic situation, is not what interests the State, or what would lead the actions of government officials, as they are in general centered on the discourse of experts. Instead, it is his trajectory as a critic without corporate scruples, engaged in telling another kind of truth, as one that can discuss and propose a different future for humanity. So, with this article we intended to produce a discussion about the following problem:the type of discourse raised by Chomsky is not that of government experts, men of science who must anchor themselves in statistical studies on disease proliferation curves, researchers who need to give prevention guidelines or economists who provide get out of the crisis scenarios. In other words, differently from a biologist, a disease proliferation specialist or a market administrator, Chomsky conceives the pandemic beyond Covid-19, as a long-term crisis, which will cover economic, social and environmental aspects of much greater proportions. In short, with this article we seek to understand how Chomsky assumes himself as a spokesman for all of humanity and how he constructs this position discursively. He is concerned with bigger problems, not diminishing the dangers of the Covid-19 pandemic, but insisting on the fact that global warming and the economic crisis created by the debacle of neoliberalism, as well as nuclear war menaces, are much greater threats to human species survival and the maintenance of the planet. We also bring an overview of three important intellectuals who also acted and contributed their reflections on the Covid-19 pandemic during its inception. They are Judith Butler, Giorgio Agamben, and Byung-Chul Han. The purpose of incorporating these distinct views is, in the first instance, to compare to what extent they may resemble the Chomskyan discourse, but also to show how intellectual discourse is constructed in times of a global pandemic in the face of the discourses of health experts or specialists who occupy the spaces of intellectual speech authority.",2023,International Relations,1
Effect of prematurely elevated late follicular progesterone on pregnancy outcomes following ovarian stimulation-intrauterine insemination for unexplained infertility: secondary analysis of the AMIGOS trial,infertility; intrauterine insemination; IUI; progesterone; unexplained infertility; ovarian stimulation; IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION; SERUM PROGESTERONE; PHYSIOLOGICAL TRIGGER; PLASMA PROGESTERONE; GONADOTROPIN; RISE; CYCLES; RATES; PROBABILITY; GESTATIONS,"STUDY QUESTION: What is the relationship between late follicular phase progesterone levels and clinic pregnancy and live birth rates in couples with unexplained infertility undergoing ovarian stimulation with IUI (OS-IUI)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Late follicular progesterone levels between 1.0 and <1.5 ng/ml were associated with higher live birth and clinical pregnancy rates while the outcomes in groups with higher progesterone levels did not differ appreciably from the <1.0 ng/ml reference group. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Elevated late follicular progesterone levels have been associated with lower live birth rates after fresh embryo transfer following controlled ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval, but less is known about whether an association exists with outcomes in OS-IUI cycles. Existing studies are few and have been limited to ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins, but the use of oral agents, such as clomiphene citrate and letrozole, is common with these treatments and has not been well studied. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was a prospective cohort analysis of the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) randomized controlled trial. Frozen serum was available for evaluation from 2121 cycles in 828 AMIGOS participants. The primary pregnancy outcome was live birth per cycle, and the secondary pregnancy outcome was clinical pregnancy rate per cycle. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Couples with unexplained infertility in the AMIGOS trial, for whom female serum from day of trigger with hCG was available in at least one cycle of treatment, were included. Stored frozen serum samples from day of hCG trigger during treatment with OS-IUI were evaluated for serum progesterone level. Progesterone level <1.0 ng/ml was the reference group for comparison with progesterone categorized in increments of 0.5 ng/ml up to >= 3.0 ng/ml. Unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI were estimated using cluster-weighted generalized estimating equations to estimate modified Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Compared to the reference group with 110/1363 live births (8.07%), live birth rates were significantly increased in cycles with progesterone 1.0 to <1.5 ng/ml (49/401 live births, 12.22%) in both the unadjusted (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.14, 2.13) and treatment-adjusted models (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10, 2.06). Clinical pregnancy rates were also higher in this group (55/401 clinical pregnancies, 13.72%) compared to reference group with 130/1363 (9.54%) (unadjusted RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10, 1.94 and adjusted RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07, 1.89). In cycles with progesterone 1.5 ng/ml and above, there was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy or live birth rates relative to the reference group. This pattern remained when stratified by ovarian stimulation treatment group but was only statistically significant in letrozole cycles. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The AMIGOS trial was not designed to answer this clinical question, and with small numbers in some progesterone categories our analyses were underpowered to detect differences between some groups. Inclusion of cycles with progesterone values above 3.0 ng/ml may have included those wherein ovulation had already occurred at the time the IUI was performed. These cycles would be expected to experience a lower success rate but pregnancy may have occurred with intercourse in the same cycle. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Compared to previous literature focusing primarily on OS-IUI cycles using gonadotrophins, these data include patients using oral agents and therefore may be generalizable to the wider population of infertility patients undergoing IUI treatments. Because live births were significantly higher when progesterone ranged from 1.0 to <1.5 ng/ml, further study is needed to clarify whether this progesterone range may truly represent a prognostic indicator in OS-IUI cycles.

The mandatory nature of vaccination in times of COVID-19: contextual approach and analysis from the Law and comparative policies,Mandatory vaccination; Fundamental rights; COVID-19; Vaccine geopolitics; Justice; EXEMPTIONS,"The most important and effective action to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, once it was verified that the initial immunity due to contagion or generalized confinements did not solve the problem in the medium term, has been vaccination. The success of vaccines is nothing new. Throughout the history of humankind, vaccines have served to reduce and even eliminate some serious communicable diseases. It is not an exaggeration to say that, together with the purification of water and penicillin, the vaccination of the population against certain diseases is one of the greatest achievements both in the fields of public health and the health of individuals. However, the success of vaccines, not only in this pandemic, but throughout history, has always been in doubt. Despite the evidence of the preventative effect of vaccines, the anti-vaccine movement has endured over time and has even grown in recent decades. Such opposition has not diminished with the efficiency and safe results that the new vaccines against Covid-19 have produced using mRNA technology; on the contrary, it has continued to expand. After the development and authorization of vaccines against covid-19 in record time, the first challenge faced by vaccination campaigns around the world was to determine the priority in access to the resource when the availability of vaccines was still scarce. The criteria followed at this point were, at least in Europe, quite uniform, prioritizing the vaccination of those most in need. That is, the elderly, who are the most prone to suffering serious illnesses. Access to vaccines was very unequal worldwide and, to avoid this, different strategies were proposed, including the suspension of patent rights or the creation of the COVAX vaccine initiative to supply countries that could not buy them. Once a greater number of vaccines were available, and prioritizing access to them was no longer the main ethical-legal issue, the debate arose in many countries about the opportunity to incorporate vaccination as a legal duty. This involved changing the majority opinion in the world; although already the subject of discussion before the pandemic, it was argued to be a moral duty to receive the recommended vaccines to preserve public health and that of others. World public opinion was very attentive to this issue of compulsory vaccination, perhaps due to the rejection that vaccines aroused in certain sectors of the population and, in particular, the vaccine against Covid-19. The discussion about the balance between the freedom of individuals and the achievement of a collective interest as important as public and individual health was resolved at the legal level by the courts of justice. Specifically, the rulings of the Supreme Court in the United States and the European Court of Human Rights in Europe established criteria that were basically convergent. Both courts understand that states have the competency to oblige the population to be vaccinated in order to safeguard their health as long as certain requirements are met: a serious risk of a pandemic, a safe and effective vaccine to combat the disease exists, and the absence of less invasive measures to achieve the same result. These rulings have served to support the specific legal measures that were adopted during the pandemic by both the different states of the United States and the member states of the Council of Europe. Necessarily different concepts have been confused in the debate, in particular those of mandatory and forced vaccination, which do not belong to the same category because they limit different fundamental rights and do so with different levels of intensity. When speaking of mandatory vaccination, reference is made to a duty whose non-compliance determines a legal consequence, be it an economic sanction or a limitation of a right. Thus, the individual who neglects the obligation to be vaccinated will be fined, have their freedom of movement restricted, their working conditions altered or their employment and salary suspended. The legal consequence is not the forced vaccination of those who resist the vaccine, but generally an economic fine. On the contrary, when it comes to forced vaccination, the individual who disregards the obligation will be legally compelled to be vaccinated, resorting even to force if necessary. In other words, the right affected directly by the measure here is the integrity of the individual. These are, therefore, two measures of different significance, from the perspective of the rights ultimately affected by the limitation, and this difference must be taken into account from the principle of proportionality. In this paper we offer an overview of the various responses adopted by different States in relation to whether or not vaccination is mandatory, which have ranged from mandatory for certain groups or even for the entire population. Among those measures of indirect persuasion for vaccination are covid passports. Our work identifies a broad agreement in the international community on the compatibility between mandatory vaccination and the safeguarding of fundamental rights when certain conditions are met. It is also recognized that proportionality in the adoption of measures is the most effective way to achieve the desired objective of reaching high levels of vaccination in the population. In any case, it would have been desirable to have advanced formulas of persuasion that would have gone beyond information and training, without incurring in the adoption of measures that strongly restrict personal liberty, such as compulsory vaccination. Faced with this international agreement, we do not find shared criteria in other areas related to vaccines: their development and authorization, their fair distribution, or information about them. This absence of shared visions and cooperation gives rise to rivalries that reinforce the traditional clashes between powers. As the purpose of the work is to compare the legal foundations of the mandatory nature of vaccines in two territories that exert significant influence in other parts of the world, and to do so from a contextual perspective. The work has not attempted to carry out an exhaustive approach to any of the many questions raised, but rather to outline, based on some of the most accredited jurisprudential and doctrinal sources, some provisional conclusions which, at least in some cases, must be subject to successive revisions.",2023,International Relations,1
"On the occasion of the centennial of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1923: Nicolae C. Paulescu-between scientific creativity and political fanatism",Nobel Prize; Controversy; Antidiabetic hormone; antisemitism; Pancreina; Insulin; ANTI-SEMITISM,"Aims Since the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1923 to FG Banting and JJR Macleod, many voices have been raised against this decision. The bitterest protest was that of the Romanian scientist Nicolae C. Paulescu. In 2002, The Romanian Academy of Sciences, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) planned to hold a series of academic events the following year in Paris to acknowledge Paulescu's scientific merits in the discovery of the antidiabetic hormone. However, the initiative was cancelled in August 2003, when the European Center of the Simon Wiesenthal Foundation (SWC) accused Paulescu of being antisemitic. The authors of this manuscript have decided to approach the Paulescu case from its double aspect, scientific and sociopolitical, to analyze the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the antidiabetic hormone, and Paulescu's alleged antisemitic past in the historical context of the Romanian nation in the interwar period. Methods We contacted the SWC and people related to the 2003 events in Paris. We performed a comparative review of the documents published by the Toronto group and by Paulescu and analyzed the correspondence and articles generated by international experts from the scientific community interested in the controversy. We carried out an exhaustive bibliographic search through several online catalogs (INDEXCAT, NLM Gateway, EUREKA, MEDHIST). We travelled to Bucharest, where we visited Paulescu's house-museum, interviewed a former student of the Romanian professor, and a prominent medical historian who was knowledgeable about Paulescu's scientific and political biography. Dan Angelescu+, son of Dr. Constantin Angelescu (1904-1990), Paulescu's nephew and collaborator, provided us with a copy of all the available documentation from Paulescu's personal archive. It constitutes an essential source for understanding Paulescu's personal, political and academic biography. Archives consulted: Romana Academy (Bucharest).

Results A-Nicolae Paulescu developed an intense long-term research activity, which included complete pancreatectomy and preparation of a pancreatic extract (PE) containing the antidiabetic hormone he called pancreina. Parenteral administration of the PE achieved excellent results in the treatment of experimental diabetes in dogs and induction of hypoglycemia in the healthy animal. This work was initiated before 1916 and published at least eight months antedating the publication of the first article by Banting and Best (February 1922), who were acquainted with Paulescu's results, but misinterpreted them. The pancreatic extract of the two Canadian researchers, -iletin/insulin-, only achieved similar results to that of the Romanian scientist once they abandoned the use of the degenerated pancreas extract (ligation of the ductal system), replacing it with the pancreas of adult or fetal bovine. Pancreina and insulin were very similar. The award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to FG Banting and JJR Macleod in October 1923 honored the successful clinical use of insulin in patients with diabetes mellitus. Paulescu's achievements were ignored. B-Nicolae Paulescu publicly manifested his Judeophobic ideology on multiple occasions in academic and political interventions and in publications and participated with other figures from the Romanian intellectual sphere in the founding of the Uniunea National Crestina (UNC, National Christian Union) in 1922 and of the Liga Apararii National Crestine (LANC, League for Christian National Defense) in 1923, antisemitic far-right political parties, associated with an irrational Christian orthodoxy and hatred of Jews. Paulescu played a pivotal role in the spread of antisemitism. Conclusions A-The Romanian scientist NC Paulescu started an intense research program aimed at the isolation of the antidiabetic hormone before 1916, including an original procedure of pancreatectomy in the dog and the elaboration of a pancreatic extract that achieved excellent results in the treatment of experimental diabetes, demonstrating its beneficial effects on the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats and reducing both glycosuria and glycemia and the urinary excretion of ketone bodies of depancreatized dogs toward normality. The results of these investigations were published in 1920 and 1921, predating the first report published by FG Banting and CH Best in February 1922. It has been sufficiently demonstrated that Canadian researchers were aware of Paulescu's excellent results, mentioning them only in passing, albeit erroneously misrepresenting key results of the Romanian scientist's publication in the aforementioned seminal Canadian article. Expert historians and international scientists have recognized that the pancreatic extract that Paulescu called pancreina and that obtained by Banting and Best, insulin, were very similar. The October 1923 award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to FG Banting and JJR Macleod ignored Paulescu's scientific achievements in the treatment of experimental diabetes and rewarded the extraordinary advance of insulin treatment in human diabetes. B-At the end of August 2003, a few days before the date of the celebration at the Hotel Dieu in Paris of the scheduled program of tribute to the scientific merits of NC Paulescu and his important contribution to the discovery of the antidiabetic hormone, convened by the Romanian Academy and the International Diabetes Federation, the Wiesenthal Foundation publicly accused the Romanian scientist of being an antisemite, an act that determined the cancellation of the announced events. The exhaustive investigation of the personal convictions and antisemitic behavior of Nicolae C. Paulescu has undoubtedly documented the Judeophobic ideology of the Romanian scientist, linked to his orthodox religious radicalism, manifested in multiple documents (mostly pamphlets) and interventions in collaboration with other relevant personalities of the Romanian intelligentsia of his time. Furthermore, Paulescu participated in the creation of political organizations of the most radical extreme right that played a fundamental role in the spread of antisemitism amongst the Romanian population and the university community.",2023,Endocrinology & Metabolism,1
THE ROLE OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY IN THE NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE,Industrial Property; Patent; Trademark; Technology; Commercialization; ,"Recent developments have once again revealed the importance of Turkiye's economic and technological independence. For this reason, the National Technology Initiative roadmap, which has emerged to increase our country's competitiveness and nationalize critical technologies, has vital importance. Strengthening the intellectual capital of our country, and in particular, the industrial property portfolio is an important issue to be considered in achieving the goals of the National Technology Initiative. Technological developments and innovative activities have become the main factors that determine the direction of economic growth and global competition in today's society, where the countries that have knowledge and can control it are accepted as powerful. To foster innovative technological progress and to support economic growth, we must encourage the creation of products resulting from intelligence and creativity. To do so, there is a need for a strong industrial property system. Without industrial property protection, businesses and individuals will not be able to take full advantage of their inventions and will spend less time on research and development. Strengthening our country's industrial property portfolio with the vision of the National Technology Initiative is one of the fundamental steps that will pave the way for original and innovative products on a global scale in our country. In line with this goal, as the Turkish Patent and Trademark Institution, we continue to work on more efficient use of our country's industrial property capacity and commercialization activities that will turn into economic value. As the Turkish Patent and Trademark Institution, while carrying out the registration activities in our country regarding the patents-utility models, trademarks, designs, geographical indications and designations of origin, and integrated circuit topographies, that constitute the industrial property rights, on the other hand, we contribute to the effective protection and commercialization of industrial property rights by raising awareness of industrial property in all segments of society, and we serve the economic and technological development of our country in accordance with the National Technology Initiative. Patent data, which is accepted as one of the most important indicators of technological developments in today's world, increases its strategic importance day by day. In this study, the analysis of the current situation of our country in the field of industrial property is discussed together with some indicators of industrial property. In addition, the activities that we carry out as a national office are also included.",2022,Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,0

"UNDERSTANDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: EXPRESSION, FUNCTION, AND INDIVIDUATION",; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; COMPUTER-PROGRAMS; FAIR-USE; ART; LAW,"Underlying the fundamental structure of intellectual property law specifically, the division between copyright and patent law - are at least two substantive philosophical assumptions. The first is that artistic works and inventions are importantly different, such that they warrant different legal systems: copyright law on the one hand, and patent law on the other. And the second is that particular artistic works and inventions can be determinately individuated from each other, and can thereby be the subjects of distinct and delineated legal rights. But neither the law nor existing scholarship provides a comprehensive analysis of these categories, what distinguishes them, or why their distinctions should matter to law. This Article seeks to substantiate and unify these assumptions, taking the most striking doctrinal difference between copyrights and patents as its theoretical starting point: namely, that copyright law has an independent creation defense while patent law does not. Endeavoring to vindicate this doctrinal distinction with a theory of what distinguishes the paradigmatic subject matters of copyrights and patents, this Article defends the view that artistic works are author-individuated, while inventions are structure-individuated. It draws on philosophical thinking, thought experiments, and existing practices surrounding expression and functionality to argue that, although two distinct inventive acts can result in the very same invention, two distinct acts of authorship - even ones resulting in works that are structurally identical - cannot result in the very same artistic work, because the identity of the author in part makes the work what it is. The Article explains how these individuation theses vindicate, not just copyright and patent law's differential treatment of independent creation, but other core features of intellectual property's defining bifurcation, and then goes on to analyze the theses' implications for different theories of what justifies intellectual property rights. Finally, the Article explores aspects of existing law that might be in tension with this conception of artistic works and inventions and thus ought to be revised to better reflect and incorporate it, if the individuation theses are indeed getting things right.",2023,Government & Law,0
Trademark value indicators: Evidence from the trademark protection lifecycle in the US pharmaceutical industry,Trademarks; Value indicators; Trademark lifecycle; Pharmaceutical industry; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; BRAND EXTENSION; MARKET VALUE; PRODUCT PREANNOUNCEMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; SAMPLE SELECTION; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; PATENTS; SERVICES,"This work identifies and studies the determinants of trademark value. In particular, it focuses on trademark characteristics that are related to the underlying brand and on legally stipulated characteristics. To reveal the value implications of the identified trademark characteristics, it follows the idea that more valuable trademarks tend to be protected for a longer period than less valuable trademarks, provided that the benefits of this protection exceed its costs. Thus, those characteristics that have a positive association with the duration of trademark protection should indicate more valuable trademarks. The empirical analysis relies on studying trademark activities in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, largely owing to its heavy reliance on product differentiation to compete in the market. The results suggest that trademark characteristics are an important predictor of trademark value. At the same time, the value interpretation of some characteristics depends on the stage of the trademark protection lifecycle (that is, registration, maintenance, or renewal) under consideration.",2020,Business & Economics,0

Such innovation can yield consumer gains through improved quality, but the additional market exclusivity granted to innovators may also delay generic entry, a practice referred to as ever-greening, and reduce consumer surplus. Quantifying this trade-off is vital in determining the optimal patent policy and regulatory treatment of incremental innovation. To shed light on this problem, I focus on incremental innovations in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressant drugs. Based on individual-level prescription data, I conduct a structural estimation and found that the consumer surplus losses due to market exclusivity extensions far exceed the consumer surplus benefits from incremental innovation. Without considering innovation costs, the benefits to innovators from incremental innovations ranged from $660 million to $2.16 billion even in the absence of market exclusivity. Evidence indicates that the market exclusivity granted for incremental innovations in SSRIs resulted in a loss of social welfare of between $4.78 billion and $11.68 billion over the period 1996-2011. The result suggests that policy makers may need to revisit the provisions for granting market exclusivity to incremental innovations.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

SG construction plays an important role in environmental protection and promoting world economic and social development. However, Chinese SG field is still in the technology research and development stage, with immature technology, collaborating with leading partners to achieve effective integration for grid operation control technology, flexible transmission, and other equipment seems to be a major challenge. Therefore, the core content of SG is to form a collaborative innovation network to interactively and instantly connect various partners, which will greatly enhance the interactive operations of power grid and improve the overall efficiency of SG. Under such a background, this article attempts to construct a collaborative innovation network for Chinese SG field and investigate dynamic evolution of this network, in order to form a communicating platform that allows collaboration and operations among different partners. Based on the application data of collaborative patents from National Intellectual Property Administration, PRC, this article employs social network analysis method and visualize the temporal and spatial evolution of collaborative innovation network for Chinese SG field. The results show that there is obvious stage characteristic in the temporal evolution process of the network, there are significant differences in the breadth and depth of interregional collaboration concerned with the spatial evolution, meanwhile, the patent collaboration relationships are diverse, and State Grid Corporation of China is always at the core of the network.

"How Industrial Design Matters for Firm Growth at Different Stages of Development: Evidence from Korea, 1970s to 2010s",intellectual property rights; patents; designs; trademarks; economic development; firm growth; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INNOVATION; TRADEMARKS; INDICATOR; SMES,"The traditional literature on the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) in innovation highlights the strength of IPR protection in the context of the tradeoff between innovation and diffusion. More recent literature analyzes the role of diverse forms of IPR in promoting innovation and growth and delves into not only regular patents but also utility models (or petite patents) and trademarks. Using firm-level IPR (patents, designs and trademarks) data from Korea, we further extend this new strand of literature to explore the role of designs at different stages of development. The data spans five decades and can be divided into three subperiods that represent different stages of economic development. We find that design-intensive sectors tend to be more export oriented. Further, firms' sales growth is significantly associated with the design intensity of firms. Such association is found only during the later stages of economic development in Korea. Taken together with earlier studies, our findings imply that different forms of IPR, in particular designs, matter differently for innovation and firm performance at different stages of development. Designs are not that important in the early stages of development when economic growth relies on the mass production of low-cost goods by low-wage workers. The importance of design rises with economic development at later stages when product differentiation becomes critical. A unique and smart appearance increases value in the eye of the customer value and, thus, could help firms' sales performance.",2022,Business & Economics,0

First, we find that, on average, stronger IPP raises the TFP of Chinese manufacturers within the context of trade liberalization.

Specifically, we investigate firm social and knowledge-based network structures individually. A foreign subsidiary can intensify social complexity by strengthening the small-worldness in its collaboration networks and attenuate knowledge-relatedness by decreasing the small-worldness in its knowledge networks. In a subsidiary, the effectiveness of these measures depends to some extent on the parent firm's experience in the host country. Longitudinal data on 401 foreign subsidiaries in the pharmaceutical industry from 1980 to 2017 have been analyzed in a quasi-experiment using difference-in-differences and two-stage regression. The results provide empirical support for these ideas. Findings highlight the explanatory power of internal network structures when discussing knowledge protection and show the utility of taking an internal network defense perspective in examining IPR protection.",2022,Business & Economics,0
The role of intellectual property rights on access to medicines in the WHO African region: 25years after the TRIPS agreement,Access to medicinal products; Intellectual property; TRIPS flexibilities; WHO; African region; ,"BackgroundIt is now 25years since the adoption of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the same concerns raised during its negotiations such as high prices of medicines, market exclusivity and delayed market entry for generics remain relevant as highlighted recently by the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics. The World Health Organization's (WHO) mandate to work on the interface between intellectual property, innovation and access to medicine has been continually reinforced and extended to include providing support to countries on the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities in collaboration with stakeholders. This study analyses the role of intellectual property on access to medicines in the African Region.MethodsWe analyze patent data from the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) and Organisation Africaine de la Propriete Intellectuelle (OAPI) to provide a situational analysis of patenting activity and trends. We also review legislation to assess how TRIPS flexibilities are implemented in countries.ResultsPatenting was low for African countries. Only South Africa and Cameroon appeared in the list of top ten originator countries for ARIPO and OAPI respectively. Main diseases covered by African patents were HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and tumors. Majority countries have legislation allowing for compulsory licensing and parallel importation of medicines, while the least legislated flexibilities were explicit exemption of pharmaceutical products from patentable subject matter, new or second use of patented pharmaceutical products, imposition of limits to patent term extension and test data protection. Thirty-nine countries have applied TRIPS flexibilities, with the most common being compulsory licensing and least developed country transition provisions.ConclusionsOpportunities exist for WHO to work with ARIPO and OAPI to support countries in reviewing their legislation to be more responsive to public health needs.",2021,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0

Under normal circumstances, when determining the scope of protection of a claim, all technical features pertaining to a claim must be considered, and the exact limiting effect of each technical feature is ultimately reflected in the subject-matter protected by the claim. The subject-matter of a claim can be a method, a product, an apparatus or a material, and it could also be the application or method of application of these subject-matters. When making an independent claim, the filing document is required to comprise two parts: a preamble and a technical features section. The purpose of this requirement is to enable the public to clearly identify which technical features of an independent claim are known in the closest prior art and which are novel over the closest prior art. Therefore, a complete technical solution, which consists of a preamble and a technical features section, is protected by the patent rights. A technical solution disclosed in a title needs to be supported by all of the technical features in the claim. Therefore, a title is a high-level summary of a technical solution, which includes every technical feature described in the claim, and it is also a simple designation of a technical solution. The title and the technical features are not one and the same. Rather, they are equal parts of a claim.The title of a claim is considered to have a limiting effect on the scope of protection of a technical solution. However, the limiting effect of a title must be viewed as a general limitation on a technical solution, which is different from the micro-limitation imposed on a technical solution by specific technical features of a claim. A term that is repeatedly used in the same document shall have the same interpretation, and different terms shall have different interpretations. According to the Doctrine of Equivalents, elements used for comparisons are technical features of a claimed patent and its variants, instead of technical solutions as a whole.",2024,Government & Law,0
Incentives to promote the US pharmaceutical innovation: empirical research based on the case of Epogen,Incentives; pharmaceutical innovation; Epogen; empirical research; pharmaceutical industry; POLICY,"Objective This study aims at emphasizing the significant impact of the incentives to promote the United States (US) pharmaceutical innovation. Methods We carried out a retrospective single-case study. We analyzed the innovation process of Epogen: basic research, applied research, regulatory, and marketing. Results Incentives and policies of pharmaceutical innovation significantly facilitates the entire life cycle of Epogen. The transfer of patent presented by the Bayh-Dole Act allowed Amgen to purchase the research results of Epogen. Relying on the intellectual property mechanisms and financing incentives, Amgen raised the funds needed for Epogen in applied research. Special review shortened the regulatory of Epogen. Epogen obtained orphan drug designation twice and 8 years of market exclusivity. Tax deduction and research funding provided direct economic compensation. The patent system enabled Epogen to obtain 32 years of patent protection (1983-2015). Monopoly pricing was a significant determinant to increase the sales of Epogen through pricing strategies. Conclusion We pointed out that Amgen has developed the successful innovation of Epogen taking advantages of the incentives. Effective and flexible incentives and policies are essential to support the entire life cycle of new drugs, ultimately forming a sustainable driver for the long-run pharmaceutical innovation.",2021,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
Can environmental protection tax force enterprises to improve green technology innovation?,Environmental protection tax; Corporate green technology innovation; R&D investment; Innovative human capital; Financing constraints; ,"The introduction of an environmental protection tax enables a smooth shift from the sewerage charge system to the environmental protection tax scheme. This, in turn, promotes a more sustainable development of enterprise growth, emphasizing eco-friendliness. This is of immense importance in advancing environmentally aware practices and sustainability. Based on data collected from A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2014 to 2021, this paper investigates the influence of environmental protection taxes on the advancement of green technology and the underlying mechanisms. Taking the execution of the Environmental Protection Tax Law in 2018 as a quasi-natural experiment, a double-difference model is employed to examine the causal relationship between environmental protection taxes and the adoption of green technology by companies. The findings indicate that the introduction of an environmental tax could markedly enhance the extent of green technological innovation within corporations. The evidence arising from the testing mechanism implies that such a tax can encourage firms to boost their investments in research and development, upgrade their innovative human capital, and mitigate financing limitations. The study found that there is heterogeneity in the promotion effect of the environmental protection tax on the green technological innovation of businesses in different regions and provinces with varying tax burdens and types of equity capital. Further research shows that the environmental protection tax has a greater impact on the promotion of utility model patent applications for green technology innovation. This paper presents empirical evidence to support further enhancement of the environmental protection tax system. It recommends designing the environmental protection tax policy with consideration for enterprises and local conditions and bolstering the system's capacity for guiding and stimulating enterprises' green development.",2024,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Protecting private collections of paintings in France in the nineteenth century Conservation history viewed through the lens of patents,; ,"Between 1789 and 1870, the ways in which works of art and collections as a whole were to be preserved were debated at length in France by collectors and by a wide array of those with a professional interest. They had a common aim: to prevent works from alteration and degradation owing to their treatment and method of display in private collections. The promotion of such protective measures at a time when private apartments were becoming increasingly accessible to visitors confirms that an awareness of the idea of common heritage was beginning to emerge. The environment in which paintings were kept was a source of major concern for the amateur, especially when it came to protecting works of art within his private apartments or in the course of travel. In attempting to address these problems, several patents were filed in France that sought to promote treatments aimed at preserving important works in private ownership, and a number of strategies were put forward for the restoration and protection of works of art, the treatment of varnishes and the hanging of paintings in domestic spaces. Patents registered for a number of inventions enable some of these preservation processes to be identified in detail.",2022,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,0

A Network Theory of Patentability,; LOCAL SEARCH; PATENT; LAW; TECHNOLOGIES; EXPLORATION; CREATIVITY; PSYCHOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; TESTS; TOO,"Patent law is built upon a fundamental premise: only significant inventions receive patent protection while minor improvements remain in the public domain. This premise is indispensable for maintaining an optimal balance between incentivizing new innovation and providing public access to existing innovation. Despite its importance, the doctrine that performs this gatekeeping role nonobviousness has long remained indeterminate and vague. Judicial opinions have struggled to articulate both what makes an invention significant (or nonobvious) and how to measure nonobviousness in specific cases. These difficulties are due in large part to the existence of two clashing theoretical frameworks, cognitive and economic, that have vied for prominence in justifying nonobviousness. Neither framework, however, has generated doctrinal tests that can be easily and consistently applied. This Article draws on a novel approach network theory to answer both the conceptual question (what is a nonobvious invention?) and the measurement question (how do we determine nonobviousness in specific cases?). First, it shows that what is missing in current conceptual definitions of nonobviousness is an underlying theory of innovation. It then supplies this missing piece. Building upon insights from network science, we model innovation as a process of search and recombination of existing knowledge. Distant searches that combine disparate or weakly connected portions of social and information networks tend to produce high-impact, new ideas that open novel innovation trajectories. Distant searches also tend to be costly and risky. In contrast, local searches tend to result in incremental innovation that is more routine, less costly, and less risky. From a network theory perspective, then, the goal of nonobviousness should be to reward, and therefore to incentivize, those risky distant searches and recombinations that produce the most socially significant innovations. By emphasizing factors specific to the structure of innovation namely, the risks and costs of the search and recombination process a network approach complements and deepens current economic understandings of nonobviousness. Second, based on our network theory of innovation, we develop an empirical, algorithmic measure of patentability what we term a patent's network nonobviousness score (NNOS). We harness data from US patent records to calculate the distance between the technical knowledge areas recombined in any given invention (or patent), allowing us to assign each patent a specific NNOS. We propose a doctrinal framework that incorporates an invention's NNOS to nonobviousness determinations both at the examination phase and during patent litigation. Our use of network science to develop a legal algorithm is a methodological innovation in law, with implications for broader debates about computational law. We illustrate how differences in algorithm design can lead to different nonobviousness outcomes, and discuss how to mitigate the negative impact of black box algorithms.",2020,Government & Law,0

This study examines the role of EPLs in the later stages of the innovation process: the commercialization of new products. In particular, we focus on EPLs' relationship with two different new product commercialization outcomes: the launch and subsequent sales of new products. Using data on small European firms, we find that, controlling for invention, stricter EPLs are negatively associated with firms' likelihood of launching new products, but positively associated with the sales from new products.

Can Digital Innovation Improve Green Total Factor Productivity: Evidence from Digital Patents of China,digital innovation; green total factor productivity; resource allocation efficiency; digital patent; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; TECHNOLOGY; PROTECTION; GROWTH; MODELS; FIRMS,"Amid intensifying global economic rivalries, China has pinpointed the digital economy and sustainable growth as key accelerators for societal and economic progress. Digital innovation (DI) plays a crucial role in propelling China's economy towards sustainable growth, by serving as the technological backbone of the digital economy. This study explores how DI influences China's GTFP through an analysis of panel data covering 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions from 2005 to 2021. The results indicate that DI greatly contributes to the enhancement of GTFP. DI can also indirectly promote GTFP by increasing the effectiveness of factor allocation efficiency including capital, labor, and technology. Heterogeneity analysis results indicate that the influence of DI on GTFP differs depending on the degree of intellectual property protection (IPP), the development of digital infrastructure construction (DIC), and the geographical location. A higher degree of IPP and developed DIC make areas better suited for the role of DI in advancing GTFP. Furthermore, in the central and eastern areas, the impact of the digital economy on the promotion of GTFP is particularly noticeable. This study offers reliable empirical evidence for the effect of DI on GTFP and contributes to China's digital economy and sustainable development.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Regulatory exclusivity protection for undisclosed test data in China: an innovative approach to implementing the TRIPS Agreement,access to medicine; China-US trade disputes; regulatory exclusivities; undisclosed test data; TRIPS Agreement; ,"Regulatory exclusivity, the TRIPS-plus protection for undisclosed test data, is considered as the principal means to extend market protection for brand-name pharmaceutical companies. When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it promised to enact new laws or regulations that will comply with article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement. China's choice of implementing the TRIPS Agreement through regulatory exclusivity resulted mainly from intrinsic demands for China's strategy of innovative-driven development, and partly from the pressure of China-US trade disputes. There are two categories of regulatory exclusivities under China's laws. One is the market exclusivity for New Drugs and Traditional Chinese Medicine. The other is the data exclusivity for Innovative Drugs, Orphan Drugs, Paediatric Drugs, Innovative Biologics; and a 'Generic Exclusivity' for the first generic drug company that succeeds in challenging weak patents of pharmaceutical products.",2020,Government & Law,0
Growth and welfare effects of intellectual property rights when consumers differ in income,Intellectual property rights; Income inequality; Endogenous growth; Non-homothetic preferences; Consumption pattern; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INEQUALITY; PROTECTION; PATENTS; IMPACT,"This paper analyzes how changing the expected length of intellectual property (IP) protection T affects economic growth and the welfare of rich and poor consumers. The analysis is based on a product-variety model with non-homothetic preferences and endogenous markups in which, in accordance with empirical evidence, rich households consume a larger variety of goods than poorer ones. It is shown that growth is independent of T when there is perfect equality and that T can only substantially affect growth when there is a sufficient degree of inequality. When there is inequality, an increase in T that is applied to both new and previously granted innovations increases growth. A reduction in T that affects only new, but not previously granted innovations, can increase growth if wealth inequality is sufficiently high. In the case where increasing T increases growth, poorer households prefer a shorter length of protection T than richer ones.",2021,Business & Economics,0

The analysis begins by providing a global picture with regard to the historic origin of intellectual property, exploring the reasons why China does not have indigenous counterparts to the western system of intellectual property rights protecting its traditional knowledge (including traditional medical knowledge) and stating the problems of transplanting western intellectual property standards in China. A discussion follows on how China, under foreign pressure, has made efforts to comply with the changing standards mandated by various international, regional, and bilateral arrangements related to intellectual property, with examples of the development of China's patent law. China's approach towards the protection of traditional medical knowledge in various international fora related to intellectual property is explored. Finally, there is a specific examination of the compatibilities between the western system of intellectual property rights and traditional medical knowledge in China, at the national and community levels. This article argues that the system of intellectual property rights does not easily fit with China's traditional medical knowledge because of China's unique cultural traits, distinctive historical context and wide ethnic, religious, and local community diversity.",2023,Government & Law; Legal Medicine,0
Balancing community rights and national interests in international protection of traditional knowledge: a study of India's Traditional Knowledge Digital Library,Intellectual property rights; patent law; traditional knowledge; WIPO; India; Traditional Knowledge Digital Library; REFORMULATION REGIME; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; GOVERNMENT; PATENTS; IGC; IP,"This article analyses how local, national and international interests are reflected in India's attempts to protect traditional knowledge through the formation of a Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL). It compares how the digital library is contextualised within India's domestic policy with how it is presented to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The article argues that WIPO has endorsed the Indian initiative and embraced the promotion of protective databases as an uncontroversial tool that diverts attention from more contested forms of traditional knowledge protection. Consequently, India has been able to use WIPO as a platform to promote itself and the TKDL to the global community. Domestically, however, the library serves other purposes. Since it systematically documents a vast body of traditional medical knowledge, Indian authorities can use the library to claim that knowedge as part of a national cultural heritage, and as a source of scientific innovations to the economic and social benefit of the country. In that regard, the TKDL reflects an interplay among local, national and international interests, where the goal of protecting the traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities against misappropriation risks being co-opted to serve national purposes.",2022,Development Studies,0
"Ethnic, racial and regional inequalities in access to COVID-19 vaccine, testing and hospitalization: Implications for eradication of the pandemic",vaccine hoarding; patent protection; neoliberalism; financialisation; inequalities; COVID-19; ,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made visible inequalities as exemplified by unequal access to COVID-19 vaccine across and within countries; inequalities that are also apparent in rates of testing, disease, hospitalization and death from COVID-19 along class, ethnic and racial lines. For a global pandemic such as the COVID-19 to be effectively addressed, there is a need to reflect on the entrenched and structural inequalities within and between countries. While many countries in the global north have acquired more vaccines than they may need, in the global south many have very limited access. While countries in the global north had largely vaccinated their populations by 2022, those in the global south may not even complete vaccinating 70% of their population to enable them reach the so-called herd immunity by 2024. Even in the global north where vaccines are available, ethnic, racialized and poor working classes are disproportionately affected in terms of disproportionately low rates of infection and death. This paper explores the socio-economic and political structural factors that have created and maintain these disparities. In particular we sketch the role of neoliberal developments in deregulating and financializing the system, vaccine hoarding, patent protection and how this contributes to maintaining and widening disparities in access to COVID-19 vaccine and medication.",2022,Sociology,0
Forced to innovate? Consequences of United States' anti-dumping sanctions on innovations of Chinese exporters,Anti -dumping sanctions; US-China trade conflict; Innovation; Patents; Products; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; IMPACT; COMPETITION; KNOWLEDGE; PATENTS; PERFORMANCE; BARRIERS; DUTIES; PANEL,"This study examines how trade protection, particularly anti-dumping sanctions on foreign exports, impacts innovations developed by affected foreign firms. Using data on anti-dumping sanctions levied by the United States (US) government on Chinese exports and on domestic patents associated with the sanctioned products developed by Chinese firms in China, our difference-in-differences estimates show that such anti-dumping sanctions imposed by the US on Chinese products significantly increased the total number of patented innovations produced by the firms exporting from China targeted by the sanctions. This effect is boosted during the proinnovation national policy period launched by China in 2006. Moreover, we ascertain a critical scope condition that targeted exporting firms increase more-substantive innovations, rather than more-marginal ones, that likely increase the value-added of their products. Overall, these findings suggest that anti-dumping sanctions could lead to an unintended consequence of prompting targeted exporting firms to enhance their innovations in order to elevate the value-added of their products, thus enabling these firms to escape the price competition of lower value-added products and mitigate the risk of future anti-dumping sanctions. This outcome means that, in an effort to protect lower-end domestic manufacturers, protectionist policies could actually intensify the competition faced by higher-end domestic manufacturers via increasing the innovations of affected foreign firms. These outcomes might not only alter the structure of product-market competition, but also contribute to greater technological competition in the future.",2024,Business & Economics,0

Then, we examine the effects of policies such as a subsidy for innovation by incumbents, a subsidy for innovation by entrants, and the extension of patent length. Our setting suggests interesting and counterintuitive results. High quality incumbents tend to be less likely to conduct innovation, which is inconsistent with Schumpeter's hypothesis. A subsidy for innovation by entrants decreases the average quality of differentiated goods. Moreover, it may decrease the growth rate of the economy if the positive spillover of innovation from average quality of differentiated goods is sufficiently large. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

How can MNEs benefit from internationalizing their R&D across countries with both weak and strong IPR protection?,R & D internationalization; Intellectual property rights (IPR); Knowledge spillovers; Productivity performance; Emerging economies; GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE; OUTWARD FDI; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; PATENTS; DIVERSIFICATION; APPROPRIABILITY; COLLABORATION; INVENTORS; LOCATION,"Although MNEs internationalize their R&D not only in developed countries but also in emerging economies that typically feature weak protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), it remains unclear how this strategic decision affects their productivity performance. This limitation has resulted in a rather incomplete understanding of why some MNEs become more productive through R&D internationalization while others do not. This study develops a new explanation, suggesting that R&D internationalization does not affect the productivity of all MNEs equally because of differences in the idiosyncratic way in which MNEs geographically distribute their R&D units across weak and strong IPR protection countries. In advancing this explanation, the study challenges the view that weak IPR protection is disadvantageous for MNEs by showing that (and specifying how) it: 1) increases the efficacy of MNEs' internal R&D, 2) strengthens the ad-vantages of accessing globally dispersed knowledge, and (3) improves MNEs' ability to exploit cross-country differences in IPR protection. The study enhances understanding of the complex role of IPR protection, shifts scholarly attention from the degree of R&D internationalization to how MNEs should internationalize their R&D, and clarifies how the IPR context of their location choices matters.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Intellectual property in times of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Human Right to health,Intellectual property; patents; pandemic; COVID-19; right to health; ,"The article analyzes the protection of intellectual property (IP) on medicines used to fight COVID-19, especially vaccines, and the shock with the human right to health. Traditionally, the State protects the creativity of authors and inventors, guaranteeing temporary exclusivity in the exploitation of creation to them in return for revealing to society the result of their work, product or process. The regulation occurs within the limits of the State's territoriality, but the dimensions are established in international treaties and agreements, such as TRIPs. The problem lies in the possibility of making patents on medicines - vaccines - more flexible, within the scope of the WTO in the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritizing the human right to health. The main conclusion is that there is resistance by the governments of developed countries and pharmaceutical companies in the quick and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutic and Covid-19 tests.",2021,Government & Law,0
Section 1498(A) is Not a Rx to Reduce Drug Prices,; ,"On June 20, 2018, The New York Times published an editorial captioned How the Government Can Lower Drug Prices, announcing that a possible solution involves an obscure part of federal law known as Section 1498. The provision acts as a sort of eminent domain for patented inventions allowing the government to circumvent patent protections if the patent holder is compensated. In the case of a pharmaceutical, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can authorize a drug maker to produce a low-cost generic version, which it would then buy in bulk.1 The authority cited by The New York Times for this proposition was a 2016 law review article published in the Yale Journal of Law & Technology (Yale Article).2 Fast forward to March 23, 2021. Within weeks of President Biden's inauguration, Senator Bernie Sanders delivered the Opening Statement at a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee hearing citing The New York Times editorial as support for the introduction of S. 909, the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2021, proposed legislation that would authorize the HHS Secretary to infringe on pharmaceutical patents or require pharmaceutical patent owners to enter compulsory licenses at royalty rates established by HHS should those patent owners be found to have charged excessive rates for the drug in question.3 On February 17, 2022, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus S. King, Jr., with Congressman Lloyd Doggett, wrote a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra urging him to use  existing executive authority to lower drug prices.4 On March 24, 2022, eight public interest groups forwarded the HHS Secretary a Petition To Make Drugs More Affordable, citing the Yale Article.5 On April 22, 2022, Senator Warren again wrote to the HHS Secretary attaching an April 22, 2022 letter from over 25 legal and public health experts describing 28 U.S.C. 1498 as the government patent use power, i.e., a tool that can be used to intervene when patients and public health are harmed by excessive drug prices.6 The chief author of this letter is none other than one of the authors who penned the 2016 Yale Article. And, on June 23, 2022, eight Senators and 103 members of Congress sent a letter to the HHS Secretary to utilize... government use compulsory licensing under 28 U.S.C. 1498... to lower prescription drug prices.7 In light of the close margins in the 118th Congress, continued pressure on the executive branch to exert 28 U.S.C. 1498 (a) should be expected. In Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States, 275 U.S. 331, 345 (1928), however, the United States Supreme Court held that the intention and purpose of Congress in the act of 1918 [(the predecessor to Section 1498)] was to stimulate contractors to furnish what was needed for [World War I], without fear of becoming liable themselves for infringements to inventors or the owners or assignees of patents. In 1949, Congress amended the Act of 1918 to precisely limit Section 1498(a) solely as a waiver of sovereign immunity to provide a private party with standing and a judicial forum in which to sue the government for patent infringement.8 No federal court, however, has held that the government has an absolute right to infringe privately held patent rights and therefore, historically, they have narrowly and strictly construed Section 1498(a), as we discuss below.",2022,Food Science & Technology; Government & Law; Nutrition & Dietetics; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

But America's twentieth century aerial dominance was not preordained. After World War I, the nascent American aircraft industry faced a concerted British effort to dump thousands of war surplus machines on the U.S. market. With aircraft outside of the nation's tariff regime, members of the Manufacturers Aircraft Association turned to Congress for emergency protections in the face of what they considered an existential threat. Despite efforts to equate a strong industrial base for aviation with the national defense, aircraft antidumping legislation became mired in partisan debates over tariff policy and accusations of wartime corruption. In the absence of relief from Congress, the Wright patent served as a barrier against the importation of foreign surplus machines.",2022,History; Government & Law,0

How does digital piracy affect innovation? Evidence from software firms,Piracy; Software; Innovation; Intellectual property; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; MOVIE PIRACY; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; DEVELOPMENT SPILLOVERS; SALES DISPLACEMENT; PRODUCT-MARKET; RECORDED MUSIC; PROTECTION; COPYRIGHT,"Despite digital piracy's well-documented impact on firm revenue, the relationship between piracy and firm innovation, including the creation of new intellectual property (IP) rights, is not well-understood. To fill this gap, this paper estimates the impact of piracy on innovation through a quasi-experimental design and explores the mechanisms driving this relationship using data on software firms. Leveraging a 2001 technological shock that suddenly enabled rising software piracy, we find increases in subsequent R&D spending, copyrights, trademarks, and patents for large, incumbent software firms. Furthermore, firms with large patent portfolios appear to disproportionately increase copyrights and trademarks following the piracy shock. After considering alternatives, our analysis suggests that impacted firms perceive piracy as a form of product-market competition that causes them to increase innovation and balance their IP portfolios.",2023,Business & Economics,0
"Protecting Intellectual Property and Appropriating Value from Innovations in Weak Appropriability Regimes Two constructs, barrier to imitation and barrier to commercialization, are two tools multinational enterprises can use to block imitators.",Weak appropriability regimes; Non-patent IP protection mechanisms; Value appropriation; FIRMS,"Overview: How can multinational enterprises (MNEs) protect their intellectual property (IP) when patents are weakly enforced? An imitator will only take action to appropriate an innovator's value if the imitator has the financial motivation, opportunity, and ability to copy and commercialize the innovator's product/service. If the innovator can decrease one of these conditions to a level that demotivates or inhibits the imitator from taking action, the innovator will have protected its IP. In this article, we introduce the constructs of barrier to imitation and barrier to commercialization, two separate hurdles that can block imitators from appropriating MNE rents. We prescribe MNE IP strategies contingent on country characteristics, local imitator capabilities, an MNE's barriers to imitation and commercialization, and the value chain activities the MNE desires to locate in the country of interest.",2021,Business & Economics; Engineering,0

We explore the sensitivity of this relationship to the strength of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection across the MNEs R&D subsidiaries. We argue that MNE innovative performance will be enhanced when the firm's R&D activities are based in locations where IPR protection is stronger. Moreover, when considering the internal geography of the MNEs R&D activities, innovation performance depends on the distance between the home- and host-country IPR regime. Thus, innovation performance is worse, as the difference between home and host IPR regimes increases. Finally, we explore asymmetries in this relationship, in particular that the deterioration is more marked when MNEs locate their R&D activities in host economies with IPR protection significantly less strict than in their home country. We test these ideas using a unique new dataset about the most innovative MNEs in the world, an unbalanced panel of around 900 MNEs observed for the period 2004 to 2013 and find strong support for all our hypotheses.",2022,Business & Economics,0
How does environmental regulations affect digital green innovation of high-pollution enterprises? Empirical evidence from China,Environmental protection tax; Environmental protection subsidy; Digital green innovation (DGI); Resource base; Technological innovation capability; High -pollution enterprise; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT,"Digital green innovation (DGI) is crucial for high-pollution enterprises to improve green performance. However, there is a paradox regarding the impact of environmental regulations on DGI, primarily due to the varied effects of diverse regulatory tools. To resolve this paradox, based on Neoclassical Economics and the Porter Hypothesis, we empirically examine the influence of heterogeneous environmental regulations on DGI using a sample of high-pollution enterprises in China. The conclusions indicate that environmental protection tax has a pushing-forward effect on DGI, while environmental protection subsidy has a crowding-out effect. Moreover, enterprises' resource base and technological innovation capability positively moderate the impact of environmental protection tax. External pressure, internal incentives, pandering to governments, and managerial opportunism have mediating effects. Our research offers a new perspective to resolve the paradox of the effect of environmental regulations on DGI, explores potential mechanism as well as boundary condition, and proposes a new way of measuring DGI of enterprises with patents. Accordingly, we offer valuable policy recommendations about the formulation of environmental regulations, the facilitation of DGI, and the advancement of China's ecological civilization.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
Cerebral Protection With Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest During Total Arch Replacement Using the Arch-First Technique for Acute Aortic Dissection,dissection with patent false lumen; stroke due to air embolism; acute type a aortic dissection; deep hypothermic circulatory arrest(dhca); total arch replacement; MORTALITY; PERFUSION; ANEURYSM; SURGERY; REPAIR; MALPERFUSION; STROKE,"Objectives: Stroke remains a serious complication after total arch replacement (TAR). To prevent this, deep hypothermia is commonly employed during TAR. We evaluated the effectiveness of cerebral protection using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) during TAR with the arch-first technique, focusing particularly on patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD). Methods: This retrospective study included 109 consecutive patients with AAD who underwent emergency TAR using the arch-first technique under DHCA, and 147 patients with non-ruptured aneurysm who underwent scheduled TAR using the same technique between October 2009 and July 2022. We reviewed these patients for major adverse events, including stroke and 30-day mortality after surgery. We also analyzed the impact of clinical variables and anatomical features on the occurrence of newly developed stroke after TAR in patients with AAD. Results: A newly developed stroke after TAR occurred in 11 (10.1%) patients with AAD. These were attributed to embolism in eight patients, malperfusion in two patients (including one who had been comatose), and low output syndrome in one patient. A stroke occurred in 3 (2.0%) patients with aneurysm, all due to embolism (P = 0.005). The DHCA time was 37 +/- 7 minutes for patients with AAD and 36 +/- 6 minutes for patients with aneurysm (P = 0.122). The 30-day mortality rate was 10 (9.2%) for patients with AAD and 2 (1.4%) for patients with aneurysm (P = 0.003). In our multivariable analysis, arch vessel dissection with a patent false lumen (double-barreled dissection) was the only significant predictor of newly developed stroke after TAR for AAD (odds ratio, 33.02; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with aneurysm undergoing TAR using the arch-first technique under DHCA experienced significantly better outcomes, in terms of newly developed stroke and 30-day mortality, than those with AAD. Cerebral protection with DHCA during TAR using the arch-first technique continues to be a viable option. Newly developed stroke in patients undergoing TAR for AAD appears to be associated with air emboli deriving from the residual dissection with a patent false lumen in the repaired arch vessels.",2024,General & Internal Medicine,0
"Can Pollution Regulations Enable Key Industries to Reduce CO2 Emissions?-Empirical Evidence from China, Based on Green Innovative Technology Patents and Energy Efficiency Perspectives",environmental regulation; technological innovation; carbon trading rights; energy efficiency; carbon peaking; carbon neutrality policies; MULTIFACTORIAL STRESS COMBINATION; CARBON EMISSIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERFORMANCE; GROWTH,"Under the influence of the dual policies of sustainable economic development and the national dual-carbon target, the establishment of an environmental protection department for the treatment of heavily polluting industries is imminent, and the country has launched pollution control policies and regulations to restrict the emission rights of heavily polluting industries. Therefore, this paper focuses on whether the restriction of emission rights in key industries has reduced carbon emissions. To achieve this, this paper uses panel data of prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2019 and adopts a two-way fixed-effects DID model to systematically analyze the impact of the key pollution industry governance policies launched by the Ministry of Environmental Protection on CO2 emissions in 2017. And further analyze the role of variables such as green technology innovation patents and energy efficiency using this model, while parallel trend tests and placebo tests, and related policies are used to ensure the robustness of the regression results. This paper reveals that: (1) The heavy pollution industry governance policy implemented in 2017 can effectively reduce CO2 emissions in the cities of the treated group, and the effect is more significant in the year of policy implementation; (2) Green utility patents and energy-use efficiency are the effective mediating mechanisms to reduce CO2 emissions; (3) Over time, the effect of heavy pollution industry governance policy on CO2 emissions gradually decreases; (4) The reliability of the baseline regression results of this paper is proved by the use of parallel trend tests, placebo tests, and tests excluding the influence factors such as relevant policies in the same period. Therefore, the key polluting industries treatment policy launched by China's Ministry of Environmental Protection in 2017 under the recent dual-carbon policy development goals formulated by China, can effectively reduce carbon emissions; however, in the future economic development process, the government should give more consideration to the continuity of the policy impact and its coherence on economic development when implementing the policy.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,0

We find that (i) higher R& D productivity, lower CIA constraints, and a lower discount rate produce non-linear effects in the conflicts concerning the markup and the nominal interest rate, decreasing the former and increasing the latter in low-growth environments and having the opposite or no effects otherwise, (ii) the markup and the nominal interest rate have non-linear effects on the conflicts concerning the other similar to (i), (iii) considering less restrictive distributions of assets, labor supply, seigniorage revenues, monetary balances and financing of CIA constraints reduces, in general, the conflicts concerning the markup and interest rate. We conclude that policymakers will only be able to use patent and monetary policies to simultaneously promote economic growth and reduce the conflict of interest concerning the other if R&D productivity is sufficiently high. Otherwise, each policy can be used either to promote economic growth at the cost of exacerbating the conflicts of interest concerning the other or achieve the opposite effect.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Risks and Outcomes of Reoperative Cardiac Surgery in Patients With Patent Bilateral Internal Thoracic Artery Grafts,; AORTIC-VALVE-REPLACEMENT; MAMMARY ARTERY; BYPASS; THORACOTOMY,"BACKGROUND Reoperative cardiac surgery in patients with patent bilateral internal thoracic artery (ITA) grafts is technically challenging. METHODS From 2008 to 2017, of 7640 patients undergoing reoperative cardiac surgery, 116 (1.5%) had patent bilateral ITA grafts, including 28 with a right ITA crossing the midline. Mean age was 70 +/- 9.6 years, and 111 patients (96%) were men. Reoperations included isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 11), isolated valve (n = 55), valve D coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 26), and other procedures (n = 24). Clinical details, intraoperative management, and perioperative outcomes were analyzed.RESULTS Aortic cannulation was central in 64 patients (56%) and through the femoral or axillary artery in 50 (44%). Four patients (3.4%) had planned transection and reattachment of ITAs crossing the midline, and 4 (3.4%) had ITA injuries, all right ITAs, 3 crossing the midline; 3 were repaired with an interposition vein graft, and 1 was managed by translocating the right ITA as a Y-graft off another graft. Patent ITAs were managed by atraumatic occlusion during aortic clamping in 90 patients (78%) and by systemic cooling without ITA occlusion in 19. There were 6 operative deaths, all due to low cardiac output syndrome (5.2%); 4 strokes (3.4%); and 5 cases of new postoperative dialysis (4.3%).CONCLUSIONS Risk of injury to bilateral ITA grafts during reoperation is high, and right ITAs crossing the midline present a particular risk of injury and should inform planning for primary coronary artery bypass grafting. Risk of low cardiac output syndrome underscores the challenge of ensuring adequate myocardial protection.(Ann Thorac Surg 2022;114:736-43)(c) 2022 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",2022,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery,0

To do that, we rely on data from a recent survey conducted by the Brazilian Innovation and Technology Transfer Managers National Forum (FORTEC Innovation Survey). Employing negative binomial models, we find that the quality of technology-transfer-related regulations has a positive impact on both patenting and licensing activities, whereas the mere existence of those regulations has no (or only little) effect on technology transfer outcomes. This suggests that the presence of regulations per se may not provide (i) the incentive necessary to outweighing the opportunity costs and motivate academics to engage in technology transfer; and/or (ii) the necessary level of clarity, flexibility and consistency to mitigate uncertainties and transaction costs for both firms and university inventors. We also find a negative relationship between regional economic development and patenting outcomes. In contrast, we determine that universities located in regions with higher levels of economic and innovative activity generate more licensing agreements. Finally, our results suggest that the marginal effects of the quality of both IP protection and licensing regulations are higher in more developed regions.",2020,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0

A meta-analysis for vaccine protection rate of duck hepatitis a virus in mainland China in 2009-2021,Duck hepatitis a virus; Meta-analysis; Vaccine protection rate; Mainland China; Duck; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; HETEROGENEITY,"Background Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) is a single-stranded, positive-strand small RNA virus that causes a very high mortality rate in ducklings. The DHAV-3 subtype incidence rate has recently increased in China, causing great economic losses to the waterfowl breeding industry. We analyzed the protection rate of DHAV vaccines used in mainland China from 2009 to 2021 and evaluated the effectiveness of vaccine prevention and control to reduce the economic losses caused by DHAV to the waterfowl breeding industry. We screened five electronic research databases and obtained 14 studies and patents on the protection efficiency of DHAV-1 and DHAV-3 vaccines.Results Meta-analysis demonstrated that immunized ducklings produced higher antibody levels and had a significantly higher survival rate than non-immunized ducklings [relative risk (RR) = 12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6-26, P < 0.01]. The age of the ducks and vaccine valence did not affect protection efficiency. Data source analysis of the vaccine protection rate demonstrated that the vaccines conferred immune protection for ducklings in both small-scale experiments and large-scale clinical conditions. The analysis results revealed that although the vaccines conferred protection, the immune protective effect differed between small-scale experimental conditions and large-scale clinical conditions. This might have been due to non-standard vaccination and environmental factors.Conclusions Domestic DHAV vaccines can protect ducklings effectively. The subjects immunized (breeding ducks or ducklings) and vaccine valence had no effect on the protective effect. Both small-scale experiments and large-scale clinical conditions conferred immune protection on ducklings, but vaccine immunization under small-scale experimental conditions had slightly better protective effects than large-scale clinical immunization.",2023,Veterinary Sciences,0

We run an interrupted time series analysis on monthly data for the three market-leading statins, focusing on economic shocks due to generic entries of simvastatin (April 2007) and atorvastatin (March 2012). We find significant variations in long-term trends and abrupt jumps in volumes and number of patients, involving the molecule los-ing patent protection and its competitors within the same family. Through counterfactual analysis, we provide comprehensive estimates of the cost savings associated with generi-cation and show that the effect due to spillovers across molecules can be relatively large. Finally, we find evidence of heterogeneous effects across age groups and between naive patients and the rest of the population. On the whole, prescribers' behaviour comes out as sensitive to price changes even in an NHS context where patients and physicians are mostly shielded from the financial consequences of choosing a specific molecule. Our ev-idence is consistent with the view that, when generication increases the price gap across alternative compounds, physicians adjust prescriptions to changes in the cost-effectiveness ratio and align their choice with policymakers' objectives more closely.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The COVID-19 pandemic and long-term incentives for developing vaccines: Patent law under stress,COVID-19 pandemic; incentives; intellectual property rights; law and economics; patent protection; INNOVATION; ANTICOMMONS; PROPERTY; TRAGEDY; DISEASES; COMMONS,"Continents are facing an apocalyptic pandemic that is terribly dangerous for millions of their inhabitants. This paper seeks to address the role of intellectual property (IP) law in addressing the problem of the COVID-19 pandemic. We suggest that the current international IP law regime and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement are not insurmountable obstacles for access to a successful COVID-19 vaccine. The publicly advocated fundamental reform or even abolition of the present IP law regime under serious information asymmetries might be counterproductive and distortive. Via existing compulsory licensing, advance purchase agreements and the employment of patent-pools, research subsidies, reward mechanisms and reputational sanctions, governments can take the steps needed to effectively overcome any IP-associated barriers to access to crucial medicines/vaccines, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the current wave of medical research on COVID-19 suggests the previous vaccine R&D 'failures' were driven by the modest demand for such vaccines and were not due to an inadequate IP-incentive stream. The paper also suggests today's EU competition law rules on the horizontal exchange of information could be seen as an impediment to innovation and thus be temporary suspended.",2022,Government & Law,0

Objective: The aim of this work was to develop and applya system for carrying out the prior art searchs by an University library, in partnership with the Technological Innovation Center (NIT). Methodology: The action research method was used and the object of study was the Federal University of S & atilde;o Carlos (UFSCar), focusing on the university library initiative Starteca - space to undertake. Results: the proposal and application of a systematic approach was considered, which comprised: 1] the application of a training course on skills necessary for librarians to perform in the process of searching for precedence and; 2] standardization of the search process execution routine, via manuals, protocols and tutorials. Conclusion: It was possible to infer that the rapprochement between the university library units and NIT can contribute to the construction of solutions that support the success of the institutional project of the entrepreneurial university in the Brazilian context, by seeking solutions based on sharing resources and skills, focused on institutionalization of the prioritization search process, aiming to protect intellectual property developed by the academic community, using patent documents. |",2024,Information Science & Library Science,0
Effects of catch-up and incumbent firms' SEP strategic manoeuvres,Standards; Patents; SEP; Catch-up; Incumbent; ICT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY; ESSENTIAL PATENTS; MARKET VALUE; STANDARDS; INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS; TECHNOLOGY; CITATIONS; DIFFUSION,"This paper investigates the effects of standard-essential patents (SEPs) to identify strategic differences between firms in advanced countries and those in latecomer countries. By comparing the SEP data-sets of incumbent and catch-up groups of the top 10 SEP firms, this paper has discovered the following four main findings. First, SEP strategic manoeuvres work as an effective way of expanding the sphere of catch-up firms' influence. Particularly after passing a certain threshold, catch-up firms' technological influence increases in an exponential manner. Second, for incumbent firms, SEP strategic manoeuvres serve as a catalyst to deepen the development of selfreliant trajectories embodied in the history and future of standards. Third, catch-up firms have specialised in short cycle technologies for self-reinforcing capability. Fourth, the effects of SEP strategic manoeuvres and international protection size on the likelihood of SEP litigation are greater for catch-up firms than for incumbent firms. These findings highlight the dual role of standards-setting organisations (SSOs) for catch-up firms (i.e., knowledge-learning and knowledge-diffusion spaces). For incumbent firms, these findings stress the importance of establishing reinforcing mechanisms to align long-standing self-reliant knowledge paths with the direction of anticipatory standardisation. This discovery provides strategic insights within the context of post catch-up strategy.",2022,Business & Economics,0
"Intellectual property rights, enforcement costs and EU competition law",Competition law; Intellectual property rights; Article 101 TFEU; Article 102 TFEU; Refusal to supply; Reverse payment agreements; FRAND terms; ,"Cases in the intellectual property rights (IPR)-Competition Law intersection have raised the issue of costs of enforcement of IPRs when dealing with the assessment of whether competition law has been breached. Importantly, a systematic underestimation of enforcement costs may be problematic for the protection of underlying investments behind intellectual property as well as obstruct the cooperation between an IPR holder and its licensees, in particular as regards patent rights. Cases on reverse payments indicate that payments by a patent holder to a generic manufacturer under a settlement agreement may well be legitimate in order avoid enforcement costs while not restricting competition. The hard stance on no-challenge clauses and termination clauses under the technology transfer block exemption regulation (TTBER) can destabilize the relation between two parties that would benefit from increased certainty when cooperating to commercialize new technology. In cases regarding the failure of parties to agree on fair and reasonable and non-discriminatory-licensing of standard essential patents, a correct approach has probably been taken in Huawei. However, it is doubtful to what extent the judgment is based upon a balancing exercise that explicitly factors in enforcements cost. Accordingly, it is argued that the current framework of analysis of cases in the intersection is inadequate to proper assess enforcement costs of IPRs.",2023,Government & Law,0
Does intellectual property protection deliver economic benefits? A multi-outcome meta-regression analysis of the evidence,economic growth; innovation; Intellectual property rights; meta-analysis; technology diffusion; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; LABOR DEMAND; TIME-SERIES; INNOVATION; GROWTH; POLICY; RIGHTS; METAANALYSIS; PRODUCTIVITY,"Both theoretical and empirical work reports contingent and conflicting findings on how intellectual property (IP) protection affects related outcomes such as innovation, technology diffusion, productivity, or growth. To establish where the balance of the evidence lies, we conduct a multi-outcome meta-regression analysis to synthesize findings form 91 primary studies that report 1626 effect-size estimates for one or more outcomes. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and selection bias only, we find that the effect on innovation, technology diffusion, productivity, and economic growth is statistically or practically insignificant. The effect remains insignificant when we control for observed sources of heterogeneity and estimate meta-effects based on different scenarios for best-practice research. Our work contributes to the existing research effort by extending the application of the multi-outcome meta-regression analysis into evidence synthesis in economics. It also provides verifiable/replicable evidence indicating that the sanguine claims about the economic benefits of IP protection voiced in some legal studies and the advocacy literature are misleading.",2022,Business & Economics,0

We challenge this new approach to protecting source code in international economic law. Using Katharina Pistor's theory of the 'code of capital', we find that this approach protects source code as capital at the expense of the regulatory power of states. The new approach differs from existing ways of protecting source code as well as from the protection based on copyrights, patents, trade secrecy, and provisions on forced technology transfer. We show that it establishes the secrecy of source code by default and leaves only a small window for states to require access to source code.",2022,Government & Law,0
Optimal Privatization and Economic Growth in a Schumpeterian Economy,Privatization; Economic growth; R&D; Intellectual property rights; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MIXED OLIGOPOLY; DEVELOPMENT COMPETITION; PRIVATE; PERFORMANCE; PROTECTION; OWNERSHIP; DUOPOLY,"This paper analyzes the growth and welfare effects of the privatization of public firms in a Schumpeterian growth model. Two alternative definitions of privatization are proposed in our model. The first is the ratio of mixed R&D firms' equity shares owned by the household, which is dubbed vertical privatization. The second is the number of unmixed R&D firms, which is called horizontal privatization. We find that, under both definitions, privatization is beneficial to economic growth while the effect of privatization on social welfare is ambiguous. Accordingly, our analysis reveals that a partial privatization could be an optimal policy. Moreover, we also discuss how the extent of patent protection is related to optimal privatization.",2020,Business & Economics,0

Medicine prices in European countries are greatly affected by the ability to negotiate reasonable prices. Concerns have been expressed that prices of patented medicines do not fall sufficiently after the introduction of lower- cost generic oncology medicines. The objective of this study was to examine the associations over time in selected European countries between the prices of oral oncology medicines, population size, and gross domestic product (GDP) before and after the introduction of generic versions. Evidence of periodic reassessments of the price, value, and place in treatment of these medicines was also looked for. The goal of this review was to stimulate debate about possible improvements in approaches to reimbursement negotiations. Methodology: Analysis was performed of reimbursed prices of three oral oncology medicines (imatinib, erlotinib and fludarabine) between 2013 and 2017 across Europe. Correlations were explored between GDP, population size, and prices. Findings were compared with previous research regarding prices of generic oral oncology medicines. Results: The prices of imatinib, erlotinib and fludarabine varied among European countries, and there was limited price erosion over time in the absence of generics. There appeared to be no correlation between population size and price, but higher prices of on-patent oral cancer medicines were seen among countries with higher GDP per capita. Conclusion: Limited price erosion for patented medicines contributed to increases in oncology medicine budgets across the region. There was also a concerning lack of evidence re-assessments of the price, value, and place in treatment of patented oncology medicines following the loss of patent protection of standard medicines. The use of such proactive re-assessments in negotiating tactics might positively impact global expenditures for oncology medicines.",2021,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

However, the lack of accurate taxonomic information for many commercial cultivars leads to commercial disputes. We sought to clarify the background of commercial cultivars in China and to provide a robust basis for patent protection. We collected 82 Tabebuia cultivars and 12 reference individuals, then developed large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using genotyping-by-sequencing. We obtained 73,219 SNPs from the test samples, which represented a substantial increase compared with previous studies of Tabebuia species. Based on these SNPs and a clustering analysis, we detected six species among the samples, as well as an uncertain population which may be a hybrid between Handroanthus impetiginosus (Mart. ex DC) Mattos and H. heptaphyllus (Vell.) Mattos. An analysis of genetic diversity to assess germplasm resources indicated that excessive heterozygosity of these cultivars in China, which may explain the genetic basis of novel-preferred selection in ornamental plants or a narrow genetic background. After rigorous selection, we identified numerous high-quality molecular markers for cultivar identification, then constructed a concise fingerprint with 54 SNPs. Our work clarifies the background information of commercial cultivars of Tabebuia in China and provides information for cultivar identification. It will serve as an important technical resource for genetic studies, and it will help to protect patents that involve Tabebuia species.",2023,Forestry,0

This article presents an IP strategic framework comprising the following strategies: a 'defensive' strategy, aimed at avoiding knowledge spillovers and building barriers to competition; a 'collaborative' strategy, aimed at collaborating with other organizations and entering new markets; and an 'impromptu' strategy, which describes firms protecting their IP without a clear purpose. We investigate the relationships of such IP strategies with outbound OI and innovation performance in 158 Italian firms. Most of them declared an impromptu IP strategy. We found that not having any IP protection strategy can be a barrier to outbound OI and that firms with a defensive IP strategy embraced outbound OI more than those declaring a collaborative IP strategy. Finally, firms with collaborative IP strategies outperformed those with defensive strategies.",2021,Business & Economics,0
An (un)common remedy to Indigenous communities' subsistence: revisiting Traditional Knowledge Commons,Indigenous peoples; Indigenous Traditional Knowledge; Traditional Knowl-edge Commons; Intellectual Property Rights; sui generis systems; global benefit-sharing; PROPERTY; RIGHTS; TRAGEDY,"Indigenous Traditional Knowledge (ITK) has been at the centre of heated debates about patent and intellectual protection for a long time. Efforts to normatively regulate the protection of ITK are imbued by a property-based logic associated most prominently with intellectual property regimes, which focus primarily on its economic value. However, such an approach collides with the spiritual, cultural and sacred character of Indigenous Traditional Knowledge. This article aims to provide an alternative for ITK protection through the revamping of the Traditional Knowledge Commons (TKC) concept. It elucidates those TKC traits beneficial to Indigenous communities and identifies potential challenges associated with TKC implementation. The article highlights instances of successfully enacted TKC as evidence of the economic and social capacity of such communitarian schemes, which can further empower Indigenous communities. Lastly, the article explores the viability of establishing a commons-alike ITK management regime on a global scale given the divergent views and aspirations both of communities providing ITK and potential ITK users.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Government & Law,0
Intellectual property and the organization of the global value chain,; VERTICAL INTEGRATION; PATENT PROTECTION; RIGHTS; DETERMINANTS; CONTRACTS,"This paper highlights the role of intangible assets in a property rights model of firm organization with sequential production. Empirical evidence based on foreign direct investment and transaction-level trade data of Slovenian firms reveals that the strength of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the supplier's location affects firms' organizational choices whenever supplier investments are sequential complements. In this case, when a firm must transmit know-how to each supplier, and more knowledge is accrued as production moves downstream, better IPR institutions lead to lower incidence of vertical integration over outsourcing, principally at more downstream stages. On the other hand, the organizational choice is far less responsive to IPR protection for sequential substitutes. Moreover, we show that improving IPR and contracting institutions (e.g. rule of law) may have the opposite effect on firm boundaries. Our findings conform with a property rights model in which the quality of the IPR regime governs knowledge transmission along the supply chain, ultimately driving firm organization through the suppliers' incentive structure.",2023,Business & Economics,0

The present study addresses this question by using 24 LDCs (treatment group) and two control groups, over the period from 1970 to 2015. The empirical analysis has established that the LDC transitional exemption was instrumental in reducing the IPR levels in LDCs, and LDCs that had lower IPR levels (i.e., those located in the lower quantiles) enjoyed larger reductions in IPR levels, thanks to this transitional exemption. Moreover, the effect of the LDC transitional exemption on LDCs' IPR levels depended on LDCs' duration of the membership in the WTO, as well as on their level of export variety-driven innovation, measured by their level of export product concentration or alternatively their degree of economic complexity.",2023,Business & Economics,0

In this study, third countries include all countries that compete with the inventing countries in exporting similar products to the importing countries. The most significant contribution of this study is to develop an alternative empirical approach for analyzing the impact of IPRs on trade flows. This approach considers three players (the inventing/exporting country, the importing country, and third countries) and thus is tentatively called the three-country model. The findings confirm that our three-country model provides important insights into the impact of IPR protection on international trade, especially in the context of increasingly fierce competition in international trade. We found that the emergence of a third country restrains the market power effects and stimulates market expansion effects. Specifically, when a third country appears, the increased protection of IPRs in the importing countries encourages the inventing countries to increase their exports. However, the export elasticity of IPR protection is highest for primary products and lowest for technology-intensive and human capital-intensive products.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Innovation Disclosures and the Design of Technology Acquisition Contracts: Evidence from the American Inventors Protection Act,acquisitions; contracts; technology ventures; innovation disclosure; adverse selection; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ADVERSE CHANGE CLAUSES; JOINT-VENTURES; MERGERS; MARKET; FIRMS; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; EARNOUTS; INFORMATION,"Material adverse change (MAC) clauses and contingent earnouts are important contractual mechanisms used to protect acquirers from the risk of adverse selection. Yet, the extant literature has not sufficiently explored the antecedents of their use, in particular within the context of technology acquisitions. In this study, we take advantage of the passage of the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA), which disseminated information through the publication of patent applications, to explore the impact of innovation disclosures on the design of technology acquisition contracts. Consistent with the view that an increase in the availability of information related to the broader technological landscape reduces the need for contractual protections in acquisition contracts, our analysis demonstrates that deals disproportionately affected by AIPA have less expansive MAC clauses and are less likely to feature contingent earnouts. These results provide new evidence linking the use of MAC clauses and earnouts with acquisitions subject to information frictions.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Medical Countermeasures for Pandemic Response and Intellectual Property Rights Articulating and Enabling Community Interests under International Law,medical countermeasures against COVID-19; immunization as a global public good; community interests under international law; international intellectual property rights; TRIPS Agreement; TRADE,"The current article addresses the question of whether and under which circumstances access to medical countermeasures against pandemics, such as COVID-19, may constitute a community interest under international law. First, the intertwined concepts of global public goods and community interests arc fleshed out. Second, the analysis expounds whether the protection against pandemics, including immunization, can be framed as a community interest, and which obligations would result. Third, the relationship between community interests and intellectual property rights as enshrined in international law is explored. Fourth, the conclusions try to reconcile the goals of international intellectual property rights and the protection against pandemics. Positive obligations to furnish medical countermeasures may not attain the consent of a sufficiently large number of states. Nevertheless, articulating the protection against pandemics as a community interest should entail obligations to refrain from resorting to international intellectual property law to impede developing patent-protected medical countermeasures in other countries.",2022,Government & Law,0
Atypical distally distributed cutis marmorata decompression sickness associated with unconventional use of thermal protection in a diver with persistent foramen ovale,Decompression illness; Pathophysiology; Right-to-left shunt; Wetsuit; NEOPRENE WETSUIT; SHUNTS,"Cutis marmorata is a mottled, marbling, livedoid rash caused by vascular inflammation and congestion in cutaneous decompression sickness. It may occur during or after ascent due to the formation of bubbles from dissolved nitrogen accumulated throughout the dive. It is strongly associated with the presence of right to left shunts, particularly persistent (patent) foramen ovale (PFO). We report a case of cutis marmorata decompression sickness of an unusual pattern associated with unconventional use of thermal protection (a 'shorty' wetsuit worn over full suit) by a diver with a PFO. The patient also had neurological manifestations of decompression sickness. The distal lower limb pattern of involvement favours the hypothesis that cutis marmorata in humans is likely to be due to bubbles in the skin itself and/or adjacent tissues rather than cerebrally mediated.",2023,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0

Addressing the Risks That Trade Secret Protections Pose for Health and Rights,; INFORMATION; COMPETITION; BIAS,"Human rights frameworks afford everyone the right to health and the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications. Both come together to create state obligations to ensure access to medicines and other health technologies. Though the impact of patents on access to high-quality, affordable medicines and health technologies has been well described, there has been little attention to the impact of trade secrecy law in this context. In this paper, we describe how trade secrecy protection comes into conflict with access to medicines-for example, by preventing researchers from accessing clinical trial data, undermining the scale-up of manufacturing in pandemics, and deterring whistleblowers from reporting industry misconduct. The paper proposes measures to diminish the conflict between trade secrecy and health that are consistent with international law and will advance health without undermining innovation.",2021,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0

In a global economy, countries may choose to protect the IP of their own citizens, foreigners, or both or neither. We develop a model that shows that countries will have higher levels of innovation when respecting both domestic and foreign intellectual property. We test this prediction and show that domestic innovation is positively related to respect for both foreign and domestic IP. Intuitively, respect for domestic IP encourages innovation. We demonstrate the less intuitive case that protection of foreign IP further incentivizes domestic innovation. (c) 2021 The Sunwater Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

While acknowledging that strong IPR promotes investment and facilitates the coverage in foreign markets where demand is much greater than that in the home market, we investigate a negative trade-off between the reduction in domestic welfare owing to business-stealing effect (BSE) and the increase in national welfare emerging from market-penetration effect (MPE), given host IPR policies. We show a partially (non-universally) strong IPR regime can nonethe-less increase global welfare even when the MPE does not universally outweigh the BSE.

We also observe that key laboratories' beneficial impact on innovation output becomes more prominent for firms belonging to high-tech industries, those led by an inventor or scientist CEO, and those located in cities that enforce the protection of intellectual property. Further, key laboratories foster innovation mainly by developing scientific research capacity, increasing human capital, and improving R&D subsidies.

Each innovator sequentially and independently chooses how many licenses to sell, and subsequently, all licensees compete a la Cournot in the product market. We show that, in equilibrium, the total number of licensees grows exponentially with the number of innovators. In addition, this sequential outcome is also obtained as a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in pure strategies of a game with endogenous timing. Interestingly, by extending the duopoly model of Badia et al.

We discuss the number of IPR infringement cases handled by both relevant administrative authorities and courts to analyze IPR enforcement in China. Results indicate that the development of IPR protection enforcement followed the improvement of relevant IPR laws.

The purpose of the paper is to forecast the future development trend of drivetrain technologies. In doing so, a revised method of technological forecasting is proposed on the basis of the S-curve simulation for growth curves and entropy weight method for ranking candidates, which leads to forecasting results are more objective and accurate. Our findings highlight that HEV has the most promising future, followed by BEV and ICEV, but FCEV develops slowly.

Innovation and environmental protection: An EU perspective,Environmental protection expenditure; Innovation; Patent; Longitudinal data; PANEL-DATA; GROWTH; SPILLOVERS; IMPACT; POLICY; WEAK,"The objective of this paper is to explore how environmental protection expenditures (EPE) affect innovation and investigate the potential causal relationship between the two variables. The novelty and main contribution of our paper to the literature stems from the fact that we look at total environmental protection expenditures from both the public and private sectors, and distinguishing between corporations and households in the private sectors. We also consider both inputs and outputs of innovation and address potential endogeneity issues in this relationship, which are both lacking in the current literature. Using a panel of EU countries over the period 2006-2020, this study generally finds a positive impact of EPE on innovation after controlling for the effects of trade, credit, education and inflation on innovation, and using the System GMM estimator to treat endogeneity. Moreover, EPE from the government sector drives the bulk of this positive impact. The core results are robust to alternative measures of innovation, alternative estimation techniques that address endogeneity (i.e., the Lewbel 2SLS, Mundlak, and Hausman-Taylor estimators) and the moderation effects of Climate Change Performance (CCPI). This study also provides a useful guide to policy makers engaged in environmental planning.",2024,Energy & Fuels; Engineering,0
Adopting industrial designs: further IP protection for US start-ups?,Industrial design; intellectual property; start-ups; innovation adoption; INNOVATION; PASSION; MODELS,"This article examines the determinants of adoption of industrial designs, for intellectual property (IP) protection, in a large sample of US start-ups. While patents and copyrights are widely analysed as ways of protecting proprietary knowledge in large firms, they are expensive forms of IP protection, both to create and to protect. For start-ups, cheaper and simpler methods have greater attraction, of which industrial design protection is an example. The article builds and tests an applied econometric model of industrial design adoption, using the longitudinal Kauffman Firm Survey, 2008-2012. The model is based on a microeconomic managerial utility theory of the firm, implemented within a random utility framework, leading to an estimable econometric model which takes the form of a binary probit with random effects. This model is run on an unbalanced panel sample of nearly nine thousand observations. It finds that expenditure on R&D plays a powerful role in the design adoption process. Incorporation and owner-managers' injection of equity also play a positive and significant part in design adoption. These three influences are all part of the commitment that owner-managers bring to their start-ups. Sales directed to products rather than services also have positive effects on industrial design adoption.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Nurturing national champions? Local content in solar auctions and firm innovation?,Local content requirements; Solar energy; Auctions; Green industrial policy; Staggered difference-in-difference; Propensity score matching; RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY; PROTECTION; DEPLOYMENT; INDUSTRY; POWER; BIAS,"Rather than by an invisible hand, many industries are kick-started by a government policy. Despite little robust evidence, local content requirements are increasingly used to incentivize domestic manufacturing if imports are cheaper. To examine the effect of local content, we explore an unintended quasi-policy-experiment. Starting in 2013, the Indian government simultaneously held solar auctions with and without local content, providing an otherwise unobserved counterfactual. We digitize the results from the 41 auctions worth 8.65 billion $ in solar module demand and collect annual revenue and solar patents of the 113 participating firms between 2004-2020. For causal identification, we compare winners of local content with similar open auction winners in a staggered difference-in-difference estimation. While we observe an insignificant increase in the same and the following year after firms win LCR auctions, overall, we find winning local content auctions does not significantly increase firms' solar patents or sales. We identify three reasons why the policy did not create stronger, lasting effects. First, local content did not create sufficient production to enable learning by doing. Second, local content did not generate enough revenue for re-investment into R&D. Third, local content reduced competition in auctions. The analysis underlines the predicament countries face as open auction winners, despite having won 9 times as much capacity, do not patent much (more).",2023,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TRADE RELATED ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AGREEMENT AND THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY: PROTECTION OF GENETIC RECOURSES,genetic resources; TRIPs Agreement; Convention on Biological Diversity; patent; disclosure of origin; ,"This paper analyzes the relationship between the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights in relation to genetic resources. The authors focus on different points of view on the interaction of these international treaties and concludes that there is a contradiction between their individual provisions, in particular, with respect to the use of genetic resources. Considerable attention is paid to the analysis of the provisions devoted to Article 27 of the TRIPS Agreement, which establishes the requirements for mandatory patenting of inventions, including microorganisms and macrobiological processes of cultivation of plants or animals. The provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity regarding access to genetic resources and equitable sharing of benefits from their use are analyzed in detail. Specific proposals were made to amend the existing international documents to overcome the current contradiction between the TRIPS Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity, based on the results of the study.",2020,Social Sciences - Other Topics,0
Determinants of Firm-Level Lobbying and Government Responsiveness in Agricultural Biotechnology in China,biotechnology; developing countries; economic development; industry studies; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT; POLICY; PROTECTION; FOOD,"Understanding what stimulates agribusiness firms to lobby the government and what makes the government responsive to lobbying are the two issues that have been discussed extensively in the debates concerning determinants of biotechnology policy. This paper examines the factors influencing agribusiness firms' lobbying and government response using econometric modeling on a new data set of 160 leading agribusiness firms in the food, feed, chemical, and seed industries in China. The results show that approximately 10% of agribusiness firms lobbied the government about biotechnology policy and regulations and over half of those that lobbied received a verbal or written acknowledgment from government agencies. Seed and feed companies are more likely to engage in lobbying than chemical companies. Owning GM patents not only has a positive impact on firms' lobbying activities, but firms with these patents are more likely to receive a government response to their lobbying efforts. The experience of selling GM products does not significantly influence lobbying activities or response from the government.",2020,Government & Law; Public Administration,0
Rulemaking S 101,; RULES,"The doctrine of subject-matter eligibility, as developed from 35 U.S.C. S 101, ensures that no one can stifle innovation by gaining a monopoly over an abstract idea, natural phenomenon, or law of nature. By excluding abstract ideas and laws of nature from patent protection, the doctrine ensures that no one can stifle innovation by gaining a monopoly over something as fundamental as the law of gravity. But recent decisions by the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit have muddied the distinction between patentable and unpatentable subject matter. The resulting doctrinal confusion around subject-matter eligibility has prompted innovators to warn of serious consequences to investment and also spurred a notoriously ossified Congress to consider bipartisan reforms. Enter the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Although this office lacks the formal authority to promulgate substantive rules on subject-matter eligibility, it has nonetheless broadened its use of guidance documents in that area as a means of addressing this crisis. This Note chronicles the USPTO's use of these guidance documents across time, as well as how federal courts and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board have come to rely on them. It argues that these guidance documents, for all their regulatory utility, closely resemble legislative rules. Looking ahead, this Note encourages Congress to grant the USPTO rulemaking authority over patentability. Until it does so, the USPTO's recent guidance threatens to push the boundaries of its current authority and run afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act.",2020,Government & Law,0

Specifically, the study empirically investigates the long-run impact of financial development, research and development (R&D) activities and the protection of intellectual property rights on knowledge production in China using the ARDL bounds testing approach during the 1979-2018 period. The study also assesses the impact of financial development on knowledge production via its interaction with financial regulations, trade openness and human capital. We measure knowledge capital stock and R&D capital stock using the perpetual inventory flow method assuming different rates of depreciation, while the financial development is measured by conducting the principal component analysis (PCA) of three key banking sector indicators including credit to the private sector to GDP ratio, the ratio of the liquid liabilities to GDP and the sum of commercial bank and central bank assets. Results show that financial development, R&D activities and patent protections are important determinants of knowledge creation in China. Further, estimates reveal that improvements to financial regulations, increased freedom to trade and the level of tertiary education moderate the effect of financial development on knowledge production. The results are robust to several control variables such as the macroeconomic environment of the economy, trade openness, foreign direct investment and knowledge accumulation in the rest of the world. The findings of the paper suggest that the steps taken to develop the financial sector and accelerate R&D activities may contribute to the accumulation of new ideas and stock of knowledge in emerging countries. Furthermore, the study emphasizes prudent financial regulations, trade freedom and improved access to tertiary education to enhance the effect of financial development on knowledge production.",2023,Business & Economics,0

This study also analyzed whether teachers' age, gender and years of experience in the profession influenced the development of this type of practices among students. To this end, the GAUBIPRO (4150516/6) questionnaire, registered at the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office, was sent out to 308 Spanish teachers in Primary Education in Spain. The investigation was conducted by applying three multivariate statistical procedures: chi-squared with Kendall's Tau-c coefficient, variance analysis using a single-factor ANOVA, and the HJ-Plot method, to find patterns of group behavior among the variables studied. The results showed that age, gender and years of experience were significant variables in the development of strategies for data protection and digital sustainability in Primary Education. For years of experience, the results showed that teachers with the highest mean number of years in the teaching profession were the least likely to apply data protection protocols. Male teachers were found to promote more general data protection strategies, while female teachers were more active in the design and use of activities in the classroom. In terms of age, the results clearly demonstrated that the higher the mean age of the teachers, the lower the rate of application of actions to promote data protection and digital security among young students, in three variables in particular: foster strategies, advise students and inform families.",2023,Education & Educational Research,0
The International Legal Problems of Ensuring the Availability of Medications in Conditions of the COVID-19,Pharmaceutical market; COVID-19; medications; patent protection; parallel imports; medical law; ,"In the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the risks of individual pharmaceutical market players or groups of players taking measures to supply medications that may lead to an economically unjustified increase in drug prices or artificially create a shortage of products are increasing worldwide. Aims: Finding the best way to protecting intellectual property rights for medications in conditions of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Methods: The methodological basis of the study was formed by an integral and coordinated system of scientific methods that contributed to the study of such a complex socio-legal phenomenon as the availability of medicinal products in conditions of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, a synergistic approach was applied, which combined the special research methods of various branches of law, pharmaceutical science and practice. Results: The article reveals and identifies the distinctive features of using patent protection measures and parallel imports in the drug markets of various countries of the world and the impact of the TRIPS Agreement on the availability of medications for the public in conditions of the COVID-19. Conclusion: For many countries, including Ukraine, the introduction of parallel imports can be efficient in the short term. Allowing parallel imports of medications has significantly fewer negative consequences for the copyright holder, since the improper quality of the products, in which the invention is used without the use of a trademark, most often does not affect the business reputation of the patent owner. Nevertheless, the chosen model of permitting the use of parallel imports to ensure the availability of medications in Ukraine remains a topical and controversial issue that requires a lot of professional discussion. Legislators should be very careful and cautious about the development and implementation of the institution of parallel imports of medications to Ukraine paying attention to the development of a whole system of quality and transparency control for procedures related to parallel imports to this country.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

Drawing on endogenous growth theory and extending the Gorodnichenko and Schnitzer (2013) framework, we hypothesize that in addition to firm-specific factors, country-level variables manifested within FC hamper incremental innovation, albeit in varying degrees due to industry heterogeneity. Secondly, as opposed to previous studies that solely focus on FC affecting firm innovation, we propose that due to resource constraints, firms in transition economies tend to follow an imitational innovation strategy, and therefore, from this perspective, IPR protection can be crucial for firm-level innovation within those economies. Using data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) consisting of information for about 21,960 firms from 27 Eastern European and Central Asian transition countries and employing a two-step probit model with endogenous regressors, we find that adverse effects of FC and IPR on firms' innovation activities are driven from within as well as between industries. Focusing on the differential impacts of FC and IPR protection across industries, we direct potential causal pathways from easing FC and optimal IPR protection to encourage firms' innovation. Based on the findings, while very strict IPR protection is detrimental to firms' product and process innovation in industries with limited resource and skill capabilities, it is nevertheless helpful for research and development (R&D) activities in industries characterised by strong R&D and IP capacities. Our results offer useful insights for policymakers to support incremental innovation as well as boost invention. IPR protection policies require to be customised to the industries and firms, since invariably tight or lax IPR enforcement can be discouraging to both incremental and radical innovation, causing all industries suffering from the same treatment.",2024,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0
Novelty and scope of process innovation: The role of related and unrelated manufacturing experience,experience; innovation; patents; pharmaceuticals; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION; PATENT PROTECTION; MARKET-STRUCTURE; PRODUCT; PERFORMANCE; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; SEARCH,"The accumulation of experience that occurs with production is likely to impact an organization's ability to develop manufacturing process innovations. However, how different types of manufacturing experience relate to the characteristics of an organization's process innovation output is an open question. In this study, we investigate how a firm's accumulated related and unrelated manufacturing experiences are associated with this firm's ability to innovate its production methods. To characterize firms' process innovation output, we observe their portfolios of patented manufacturing inventions, which we qualitatively evaluate over time, through a unique collaboration with expert patent attorneys, along two critical dimensions: novelty and scope. We argue that related manufacturing experience leads to a better understanding of parts of the focal product's technological landscape that will allow the development of inventions of broader scope. However, it may also contribute to inertia in that it might restrict the firm's innovative activity to more familiar regions of the landscape, thereby limiting inventions' novelty. Conversely, manufacturing experience with products that are unrelated to the focal product is expected to stimulate and support a broader search that includes more distant regions of the focal product's technological landscape, which would lead to more novel manufacturing inventions. Yet, the application of this unrelated experience to the production of the focal product is likely to require additional exploratory effort in a not-well-understood region of the focal product's landscape, likely resulting in inventions of limited scope. In line with our hypotheses, we find that related (unrelated) manufacturing experience is positively (negatively) associated with inventions' scope, and negatively (positively) associated with inventions' novelty. In addition to supporting the relevance of a multidimensional evaluation of innovations, our findings provide practical guidance regarding the strategic implications of a firm's knowledge management.",2022,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,0
Intellectual Property Pledge Financing and Enterprise Innovation: Based on the Perspective of Signal Incentive,intellectual property pledge financing; enterprise innovation; urban sustainable development; digital economy; staggered DID; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; SHORT-TERMISM; MARKET VALUE; INVESTMENT; PERFORMANCE; PATENTS; HORIZON,"As a driving force behind urban sustainable development, enterprise innovation has become an increasingly important issue in the digital economy. In this context, a financing model called intellectual property pledge financing (IPPF) has been widely implemented, potentially promoting innovation output in developed countries. However, for countries with relatively low levels of intellectual property (IP) protection, the impact of IPPF on enterprise innovation is divergent, as it may lead to patent signal failure. China's implementation of IPPF since 2008 provides an ideal quasi-natural experiment for researching IPPF in such countries. Using panel data of China's listed companies from 2007 to 2017, we employ the staggered Difference-in-Differences (DID) method to examine the impact of IPPF on enterprise innovation. The results demonstrate a significantly positive impact overall, with a more pronounced effect in urban areas characterized by high intellectual property protection and digitalization. Various robust tests, including event study, Bacon decomposition, and propensity score matching (PSM), were conducted. Additionally, our findings suggest that IPPF facilitates enterprise innovation by expanding external credit resources and optimizing internal management from the perspective of open innovation (OI). It signals banks and investors to provide favorable credit support externally, helps alleviate managerial myopia, and increases manager risk preference internally. These results offer empirical evidence and suggestions for promoting IPPF as a means to stimulate enterprise innovation and achieve urban economic sustainable development.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Using the establishment of intellectual property courts (IPCs) by the Chinese government in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in 2014 as a quasi-natural experiment, we build a difference in differences model to assess the impact of legal regulation on firm performance from a judicial perspective. The results show that the IPC reform significantly promotes the growth of firm performance, and this incentive effect is realized through the innovation quality mechanism. For different enterprises, the effect of IPC policy is more evident among firms with strong external funding dependence, large enterprise size, large spillover effects, and state ownership. In addition, we calculated sustainability indicators for firms and found that IPCs increased firms' total factor productivity through quality-based innovation mechanisms. The important contribution of this study is that it fills a research gap in examining the impact of legal regulation on firms from a judicial perspective by identifying the relationship between judicial protection of IPRs, innovation, and business performance. This paper has implications for the promotion of judicial reform in countries with weak IPR systems, for developing countries like China, the judicial protection of IPRs should be increased to provide an institutional environment more conducive to enterprise development.",2024,Business & Economics,0

Co-infections are among many factors associated with immune dysfunction and sub-optimal vaccination outcomes. Chronic, asymptomatic viral infections can contribute to the modulation of vaccine efficacy through various mechanisms. Human Pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1) persists in immune cells thereby potentially modulating immune responses. We investigated whether Pegivirus infection influences vaccine-induced responses and protection in African volunteers undergoing whole P. falciparum sporozoites-based malaria vaccination and controlled human malaria infections (CHMI).MethodsHPgV-1 prevalence was quantified by RT-qPCR in plasma samples of 96 individuals before, post vaccination with PfSPZ Vaccine and after CHMI in cohorts from Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea. The impact of HPgV-1 infection was evaluated on (1) systemic cytokine and chemokine levels measured by Luminex, (2) PfCSP-specific antibody titers quantified by ELISA, (3) asexual blood-stage parasitemia pre-patent periods and parasite multiplication rates, (4) HPgV-1 RNA levels upon asexual blood-stage parasitemia induced by CHMI.ResultsThe prevalence of HPgV-1 was 29.2% (28/96) and sequence analysis of the 5 UTR and E2 regions revealed the predominance of genotypes 1, 2 and 5. HPgV-1 infection was associated with elevated systemic levels of IL-2 and IL-17A. Comparable vaccine-induced anti-PfCSP antibody titers, asexual blood-stage multiplication rates and pre-patent periods were observed in HPgV-1 positive and negative individuals. However, a tendency for higher protection levels was detected in the HPgV-1 positive group (62.5%) compared to the negative one (51.6%) following CHMI. HPgV-1 viremia levels were not significantly altered after CHMI. Conclusions HPgV-1 infection did not alter PfSPZ Vaccine elicited levels of PfCSP-specific antibody responses and parasite multiplication rates. Ongoing HPgV-1 infection appears to improve to some degree protection against CHMI in PfSPZ-vaccinated individuals. This is likely through modulation of immune system activation and systemic cytokines as higher levels of IL-2 and IL17A were observed in HPgV-1 infected individuals. CHMI is safe and well tolerated in HPgV-1 infected individuals. Identification of cell types and mechanisms of both silent and productive infection in individuals will help to unravel the biology of this widely present but largely under-researched virus.",2021,Virology,0

To account for this evidence, we set up a horizontally differentiated product model in which an innovative exporter competes for market share in a destination against many non-innovative rivals. We argue that as the competition among the exporters of the non-innovative product becomes more intense, the innovative firm exports more compared with its non-innovative rivals in more distant markets, a prediction that is empirically confirmed in the dataset for Greek innovative exporters.

However, frequently the abuse of PbV in some artificial foods is still exposed by media. Current methods for the detection of PbV have to perform tedious pre-processing and the detection sensitivity and speed are required to be further improved. Results: In this work, we immobilize gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) on the surface of ZnFe2O4 with aid of Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) to prepare a novel magnetic surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate (designated as ZnFe2O4-IP6-Au NPs) for rapid detection of PbV in beverages. Synergistic effect of magnetic enrichment, magnetic inducing improvement effect (MIIE) and efficient charge transfer (CT) enables ZnFe2O4-IP6-Au NPs-based SERS assay to achieve limit of detection of PbV down to 1.31 x 10-8 mol/L and a concentration linear relationship ranging from 8.6 x 10-4 to 8.6 x 10-8 mol/L. The detection recoveries for PbV in beverages locate in the range from 98.1 to 102.5 %, meaning the feasibility of method. In addition, the presence of IP6 protection greatly improves the storage stability of ZnFe2O4-IP6-Au NPs.

We use content analysis to identify the efficiency of institutional investors' communication, and find that institutional investors' communication promotes corporate green innovation. The mechanism analysis indicates that institutional investors' communication improves managers' awareness of green transformation, promotes corporate green investment efficiency and mitigates the extent of greenwashing. The positive impacts of institutional investors' communication are more effective on corporate utility patents than on invention patents. Such green governance effects are more pronounced in non-state-owned firms, green investors and close-distance to the institutional investors. By introducing exogenous shocks of the New Environmental Protection Law and China's regional carbon emissions trading market pilots, we find that the impact of institutional investors' communication on green innovation is enhanced after the implementation of environmental policies.

NEW DESIGNS OF VARIABLE STIFFNESS COUPLINGS,variable stiffness couplings; pneumatic torsional vibration tuners; design; patents; properties; ,"Flexible couplings are widely used in mechanical drives of transport and other machines. A fundamental function of flexible shaft couplings regarding torsional vibration is the optimum tuning of torsional oscillating mechanical systems. At the authors' workplace, the focus is on the research and design of pneumatic couplings, where the torque is transmitted mainly by compressed gas (air) in their pneumatic flexible elements. The primary advantage of these couplings is that their mechanical properties can be quickly and effectively adjusted, especially the dynamic torsional stiffness, by air pressure change directly while the mechanical system is running. This allows us to tune the properties of the pneumatic coupling according to the current parameters of the machine drive to avoid resonance and minimize torsional vibration. Therefore, we tend to refer to them as pneumatic tuners of torsional vibration. This paper aims to present two new types of these pneumatic tuners that were recently granted patent protections, namely Pneumatic flexible shaft coupling with hose flexible element and Drum pneumatic flexible shaft coupling. Because these pneumatic tuners are not in practical use yet, this paper describes only their design and supposed benefits.",2022,Transportation,0
Does insiders share pledging stifle innovation?

Firstly, we find a negative effect of both the existence of pledging and the intensity of pledging activities on firm innovation, measured by R&D and patent application. Pledging by insiders with decision rights is associated with a 4.6% decline in R&D activities and 0.5% decline in patent applications, respectively, which accounts for 4.0% and 10.6% of the mean of each variable. This result holds using a propensity-score matched sample. In addition, we instrument pledging activities by financing constraints faced by other firms controlled by the same controlling insiders who pledge shares. IV estimation yield similar results. Secondly, we find share pledge activities have more pronounced effect on firm innovations when firms are located in areas with strong property rights protection, when firms are non-SOEs, or when pledging insiders serve on corporate boards. Lastly, we also find a negative effect of share pledging of other firms with common shareholders on firm innovations of interest. Overall, our findings suggest that pledging shares by insiders stifle firm innovation because share pledging reduce insiders' preference for risk taking.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Smart Grids and Machine Learning in Chinese and Western Intellectual Property Law The Key Role of Machine Learning in Integrating Sustainable Energy into Smart Grids and the Corresponding Approaches to Asset Protection in Intellectual Property Law,Machine learning; Smart grid; Patent law; Copyright law; AI; Compulsory licensing; ,"Having huge power grids successfully integrate sustainable energy sources requires a smart and flexible power grid management system. Such smart systems have to adapt fast and accurately to a great amount of data input - a task which is made easier by applying modern machine learning technology. Solutions crafted by dynamic and powerful computing algorithms have the potential to surpass human cognitive capabilities. The question arises whether and how intellectual property law can be used to set the right incentives. This paper initially describes the basic functions of smart grids and the corresponding necessity of machine learning. Subsequently, it will analyze the current approaches of the most relevant patent offices in dealing with the challenges of AI-related smart grid inventions. Ultimately, it will be demonstrated that the contemporary discussions fail to focus on practical considerations of market entry possibilities that might be more promising than the approach of creating new exclusionary intellectual property rights.",2021,Government & Law,0
Emissions trading and firm innovation: Evidence from a natural experiment in China,Emissions trading; Technological innovation; Environmental regulation; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDIES; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; PORTER HYPOTHESIS; TECHNICAL CHANGE; EU ETS; PERFORMANCE,"This study investigates the causal impact of market-based environmental regulation on firm innovation by examining a large-scale market-based regulatory attempt in a developing country, namely, China's sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions trading program. Based on the panel data of China's publicly traded firms from 2004 to 2015, we adopt the difference-in-differences (DID) model to examine the innovation effects of the SO2 emissions trading pilot policy. The results show that the program leads to a significant increase in patents and environmental patents among regulated firms. And the innovation effects of the policy perform better in areas with a high level of environmental enforcement. In further analysis, we find that the program decreases SO2 emissions and promotes industrial growth in pilot areas. These evidences imply that the market-based emissions trading policy indeed promotes firm innovation and environmental innovation even in the context of a developing country, which is conductive to a win-win situation in both environmental protection and economic growth.",2020,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0

The results of the difference -in-differences estimation show that the CEPI has a long-term positive effect on corporate green innovation in the form of green patents. The CEPI influences corporate green innovation through legitimacy pressure and value-enhancing corporate risk-taking. The positive effect is more pro-nounced in the provinces which are relatively more developed and less dependent on the sec-ondary industry. Moreover, this effect is primarily driven by overcompliance motive and is visible in firms with better internal governance, state-controlled firms, and firms with political con-nections.

Such protection is needed to maintain the integrity of Indigenous relationship to and control over such resources, while allowing for potential benefits from such resources to support tribal social and economic development. Using the case study of taramea (Aciphylla aurea), a sub-alpine speargrass, traditionally used to make fragrance by Ngai Tahu (a large tribe from the South Island, New Zealand), we assess potential approaches to protection, ranging from national and international intellectual property approaches such as trademarking, copyright and patenting to extra-legal approaches such as supply chain auditing, blockchain, biocultural trademarks and biocultural labels. From this assessment, we evaluate approaches' usefulness against a range of Indigenous and market-oriented attributes. We find that while each approach has advantages and disadvantages, no one method is superior, so we recommend a mix of approaches.",2023,Ethnic Studies,0
Do environmental courts break collusion in environmental governance? Evidence from corporate green innovation in China,Environmental courts; Local governance; Collusion; Corporate green innovation China; POLICY; ENFORCEMENT,"The environmental courts represent institutional innovation in the judicial system independent of administrative regulations, this study examines whether and how environmental courts promote corporate green innovation by breaking collusion in Chinese heavily polluting listed firms from 2003 to 2020. Based on a staggered differencein -difference analysis, our findings show that environmental courts have a stronger stimulating effect on green innovation quality and no effect on low -quality green patents. This effect is particularly more pronounced for firms with lower risk -taking ability, higher green agency costs, and state-owned firms. We also confirmed that environmental courts enhance authoritative judicial constraints on local governments, thereby curbing collusion and forcing them to implement environmental protection subsidies and administrative penalties to optimize corporate green innovation structure. Our fine-grained analysis indicates that independent green patents are more sensitive to environmental courts than collaborative ones. However, corporate green R&D efficiency does not improve following the establishment of environmental courts. Overall, our study underscores the importance of strengthening environmental justice as an effective mechanism for facilitating a just transition to a low -carbon green economy.",2024,Business & Economics,0

This study delves into the intricate relationship between managerial ability, intellectual property rights (IPRs) and research and development (R&D) investments contextualized within the dynamics of leverage, firm life stages and tangibility for pharmaceutical firms in the Asia-Pacific region. By exploring how micro-level factors influence macro-level innovation processes, this study aims to contribute to the broader understanding of creativity and innovation, a theme at the heart of addressing contemporary global challenges. Design/methodology/approachEconometric methodologies were used to analyse a data set comprising 2,660 firm-year observations spanning the decade from 2011 to 2020. FindingsA key finding was that companies with lower managerial prowess strategically leverage R&D intensity to signal their value to the market and accrue reputational currency. The research unearths a significant positive relationship between managerial ability, IPRs and R&D investment. In environments characterized by strong managerial acumen and robust IPR safeguards, firms exhibit a heightened propensity to allocate resources to R&D endeavours. This underscores the role of intellectual leadership and legal protections in shaping R&D strategies within the pharmaceutical domain. Incorporating firm life stages as a moderating factor reveals that firm maturity fundamentally influences the interplay between managerial ability, IPRs and R&D expenditure. Originality/valueThese findings' implications resonate profoundly within policy-making circles and pharmaceutical firms' day-to-day operational strategies, underscoring the pivotal role of intellectual capital and legal safeguards in shaping the future of innovation in the Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical sector.",2024,Business & Economics,0
A dynamic model of price competition and promotion in prescription drug markets,Competitive pricing strategy; Pharmaceutical markets; Direct-to-consumer advertising; Detailing; Dynamic game; TESTS; INFORMATION; LEADERSHIP; CONSUMERS,"In prescription drug markets, the effects of advertising on demand for the drug category and for specific brands have been studied, and the interaction between price and non-price promotions, acting on demand for the drug, is well established. More recently, supply-side decisions such as competitive pricing strategies between rival firms in the same therapeutic category, and the interaction between them and consumer advertising have been examined. The study extends the research on the relationship between competitive pricing strategies and direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) by developing and estimating a dynamic model in which sales is influenced by a combination of consumer advertising, detailing, and pricing. The model is estimated using US data from two medical therapeutic categories. One of these datasets has been used in estimation of a static model in a recently published study, and we compare the results of our dynamic model with the static model results. A dynamic model is appropriate for a market where there is a limited period and planning horizon for recovering the costs of drug development before a branded prescription drug loses its patent protection. The relationship between DTCA, detailing, and pricing under different competitive strategies is examined empirically. It is found that the dynamic model can contradict a basic conclusion of a static model, regarding mode of competitive pricing behavior. The relationship between amount and type of DTCA and competitive pricing strategy is as found in previous studies. There are implications for the marketing of pharmaceutical brands during their period of patent protection.",2022,Business & Economics,0

We use the method of percutaneous angiographic balloon left internal mammary artery (LIMA) occlusion and cardioplegic arrest.Aim: To compare the data of patients with angiographic balloon LIMA-occlusion and those without occlusion in operations re- lated to prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), and determine the degree of safety and benefits of the method.Material and methods: A total of 20 patients undergoing surgery for PVE with a patent LIMA-LAD graft were analyzed retro- spectively. We divided the patients into 2 groups: group A - patients with LIMA occlusion; and group B - patients without LIMA occlusion. The pre-, intra-and postoperative results were compared and the degree of safety and benefits of the application of the method were studied.Results: 80% of patients in group A needed only dopamine infusion and 20% needed the addition of a second catecholamine at the end of CPB. In group B, the need for double catecholamine maintenance was noted in 50% of patients. The need for implantation of an intra-aortic balloon pump due to refractory heart failure was registered in 10% of patients in group A and in 20% of patients in group B. In terms of survival, mortality in the group with LIMA occlusion was 0%, while in the group without LIMA occlusion it was 20%.Conclusions: Our observations suggest that angiographic balloon LIMA occlusion is a reliable, easily applicable and relatively safe technique that improves the surgical results.",2022,Surgery,0

All patients in Group B showed persistent shunt in the follow-up period (n = 199, 100%). In Group A, seven patients were diagnosed with residual shunt during echocardiography examination (5%). A new onset of atrial fibrillation occurred in seven patients in Group A (5%) and six patients in Group B (3%), p = .117. Recurrent stroke occurred in 3 patients in Group A (2%) and 11 patients in Group B (6%), p = .021. One patient died of unknown reason (1%) and two patients were lost due to neurological death (1%) in Group B, whereas no patients in Group A died during the follow-up period.ConclusionOur results show that strict exclusion of patients over 60 years from PFO closure should be reconsidered. As life expectancies are increasing, patients should be considered for same treatment as younger patients, since the outcomes are improved compared to patients treated with medical therapy alone. Results of this follow-up-study show that strict exclusion of patients over 60 years from patent foramen ovale closure should be reconsidered.

The petroleum ether extract of fruit (FPE) had the highest amount of total flavonoids, cholesterol-lowering activity, and better DPPH radical scavenging capacity. The ethyl acetate extract of fruit (FEE) had the highest antioxidant activity. The petroleum ether extract of the leaf (LPE), fruit (FPE), and ethyl acetate extract of twig (TEE) had strong inhibiting lipid oxidation activity (ILOA) and DNA damage protection potential, accompanied with high total phenols and flavonoids content. It suggested that polyphenol contents, flavonoid contents, or both to Hongguo 2 were positively correlated with the three biological activities, moreover, the low polarity extracts of the high ILOA could improve the cholesterol-lowering activity or DNA damage protection potential through the synergism among different polyphenolic and flavonoids compounds.

Almost 70% of freshwater resources are consumed by crops and livestock, mainly serving farms and meat production. The agriculture sector has many adverse environmental impacts, including those related to direct and localized pollution. Furthermore, the meat industry in particular generates more carbon emissions than the transport sector. Meat production is expected to increase by at least 30% by 2050, accelerated by the on-going increase in the meat-consuming adult population worldwide. To address this environmental issue, this study aims to investigate the dynamic effects of meat production and technological advances on the environment. The two-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) was used for a panel of 37 developing and developed nations over the years from 1998 to 2018. Four different indicators captured environmental protection: CO2 emissions from agriculture, CO2 emissions from transportation, CO2 emissions from liquid fuel energy, and CO2 emissions per capita. For technological advances three main patent indicators were used: environmental-related, biotechnology, and ICT patents. The empirical evidence reveals three major results: (1) Meat production hurts the environment by increasing atmospheric pollution; (2) GDP per capita growth and urbanization exert a negative influence on the environment; (3) the interactive effects of technological advances and meat production have a positive impact on the environment; (4) most empirical outcomes show negative net effects on environmental sustainability. Policymakers need to encourage the development and adoption of technological advances in the meat industry to mitigate carbon emissions.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Institutions ranging from the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the French National Centre for Scientific Research to the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers conduct basic and applied R&D to create commercially valuable knowledge that supports the innovation goals of their respective government sponsors. Globally, the single largest public sector R&D sponsor is the U.S. federal government. In 2019 alone, the U.S. government allocated over $14.9 billion to federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), also known as national labs. However, little is known about how federal agencies' utilization of FFRDCs, their modes of R&D collaboration, and their adoption of non-patent intellectual property (IP) policies (copyright protection and materials transfer agreements) affect agency-level performance in technology transfer. In particular, the lack of standardized metrics for quantitatively evaluating government entities' effectiveness in managing innovation is a critical unresolved issue. We address this issue by conducting exploratory empirical analyses of federal agencies' innovation management activities using both supply-side (filing ratio, transfer rate, and licensing success rate) and demand-side (licensing income and portfolio exclusivity) outcome metrics. We find economically significant effects of external R&D collaborations and non-patent IP policies on the technology transfer performance of 10 major federal executive branch agencies (fiscal years 1999-2016). We discuss the scholarly, managerial, and policy implications for ongoing and future evaluations of technology transfer at federal labs. We offer new insights and guidance on how critical differences in federal agencies' interpretation and implementation of their R&D management practices in pursuit of their respective missions affect their technology transfer performance outcomes.

Biorefinery and sustainability for the production of biofuels and value-added products: A trends analysis based on network and patent analysis,; CIRCULAR BIOECONOMY; STRATEGY,"Biorefineries are modern mechanisms used for producing value-added products and biofuels from different biomass sources. However, a crucial challenge is to achieve a sustainable model for their adequate implementation. Challenges related to technical efficiency and economic feasibility are two of the most relevant problems. Therefore, the present study sought to determine the current trends in basic research and technological development around biorefining and sustainability. We carried out a co-occurrence analysis and a patent analysis using data obtained from the Scopus and Lens databases to provide a general overview of the current state of this area of knowledge. The co-occurrence analysis intends to provide an overview of biorefining and sustainability based on terms associated with these two concepts as a starting point to determine the progress and existing challenges of the field. The results of the patent analysis consisted in identifying the main technological sectors, applicants, and territories where inventions associated with biorefining are registered. The analysis of the information showed that bioeconomy, techno-economic aspects, circular economy, technical issues associated with biomass production, and biofuels represent the focal point of basic research in a wide range of disciplines. Technology development is focused on fermentation, enzymes, and microorganisms, among other areas, which shows the validity of these traditional techniques in addressing the problems faced by the bioeconomy. This scenario shows that developed economies are the driving force behind this area of knowledge and that the PCT system is fundamental for the protection and commercialization of these inventions in places different from where they originated. Furthermore, the challenge lies in learning to work in alternative and complementary technological sectors, beyond microbiology and enzyme applications, in pursuit of the sector's technical and economic feasibility.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0

Taking Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2010 to 2019 as samples, this paper divides environmental regulations into three categories: command-based environmental regulation (ER1), market-based environmental regulation (ER2) and voluntary environmental regulation (ER3), studies their impact on enterprise GTI, and discusses the joint effect of enterprise research and development (R&D) investment and government support from the perspective of internal and external linkage of enterprises. In addition, this paper also analyzes the compound effect and time effect of environmental regulation. The research conclusions are as follows: (1) From the perspective of policy types, both ER1 and ER 2 could stimulate enterprises to carry out GTI, and the promotion effect of green utility model patents is slightly higher than that of green invention patents. ER3 inhibits enterprise GTI. In addition, this paper finds that the effect of three environmental regulations acting at the same time is greater than that of one of them. (2) The mechanism analysis shows that the R&D investment of enterprise positively could moderate the relationship between ER2 and green invention at the significance level of 5%, positively moderate the relationship between ER2 and green utility model patent at the significance level of 1%, and negatively moderate the relationship between ER3 and green utility model patent at the significance level of 5%. The government support could moderate the relationship between environmental regulation and green utility model patents at the significance level of 5% and 10%. (3) The effect analysis shows that the transformation rate of GTI in China needs to be improved. The three environmental regulations could have an effect on enterprise GTI in a short period, and ER1 has the fastest effect. (4) Considering the differences in the level of economic development and resource endowments in various regions of China, this paper classifies the sample enterprises and finds that the impact of environmental regulation on enterprise GTI is heterogeneous in terms of location, ownership nature, factor density and industry type.

Even though seminal studies have explored the multidirectional attempts of the leading institutional effort on open-source biology, namely synthetic biology, to navigate the intellectual property (IP) regime, the question of how open-source biotech communities actually see and conceive IP system remains open. I propose to contribute to the understanding of how open-source biotechnology dovetails with IP regimes by untangling how enthusiasts of Do-It-Yourself biology (DIYbio) network relate to the IP system and patent rights. Grounded in science studies, and drawing particularly on scholarship on computer hacking and biotechnologies, I report on a discourse analysis of twenty-five semi-structured interviews with members of DIYbio, mostly located in Canada. The concept of responsible IP rights is introduced as a heuristic tool to account for interviewees' complex and multilayered relationship to the IP regime. This relationship, which can be described as a critical adherence, appears to be empirically grounded on three main discursive categories: patents rights as a dysfunctional imperative, for innovation's sake, and making is owning. Through these categories, the interviewees express their compliance with the enforcement of IP rights when needed (market protection) or desired (individual choices), while committing to an open-source approach to biotechnological innovation, which requires the free circulation of enabling resources. The conclusion suggests that such conception of IP rights is built on an idealization of IP regime as a dual-use device, in analogy to dual-use technologies.",2022,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0

Design/ Methodology/ Approach: This study was carried out with 19 small and medium companies from a RIS in the state of Parana, where we collect data relating to the infrastructure and investments in R&D, types of innovation projects, impact on revenue, activities of innovation, innovation protection methods, and information sources used by companies. Results: The results showed that: companies with higher investments in R&D, which generate innovative products and patents, have a higher financial return; the generation of patents is incipient among the companies surveyed; product process and organizational innovation are the main innovation activities carried out; there is some difficulty in establishing external partnerships for the development of innovation, especially with universities; customers, users, and the internet are the primary sources of information used by companies. Limitation of the investigation: With respect to research limitations, we point out that our research sample is limited to 19 companies. Thus, for the results to be generalized, a larger sample is recommended.

Intellectual property rights protection and export product quality: Evidence from China,Intellectual property protection; Export product quality; Firm heterogeneity; PATENT RIGHTS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; TRADE CREDIT; INNOVATION; ENFORCEMENT; INSTITUTIONS; TECHNOLOGY; INVESTMENT; COUNTRIES; GEOGRAPHY,"Intellectual property rights protection (IPP) at destination countries is an important determinant of exports, a result shown by the existing literature. This paper empirically examines the effect of the degree of IPP on export product quality at the origins, using firm-product level data from Chinese exporters and city-level statistics of IPP. To establish the causal relationship, we employ an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Our panel regression results from 2008 to 2013 show that the de facto IPP contributes to the export product quality upgrading and the result is robust against variations of IPP measures, IVs, and different combinations of control variables such as the firm and industry level subsidies. Our heterogeneity results indicate that the betterment of IPP favors less capital-intensive firms; foreign-owned firms relative to domestic-owned firms; and firms in innovation-intensive industries. The effect of IPP on export product quality is statistically insignificant in certain geographic regions (i.e., central and western regions) and trade mode (i.e., processing trade). In addition, we show that the channels through which IPP takes effect on product quality include strengthened R&D input, new product development, and mitigated financial constraints.",2022,Business & Economics,0
The effects of environmental regulation and environmental protection investment on green technology innovation of enterprises in heavily polluting industries-based on threshold and mediation effect models,environmental regulation; green technology innovation of enterprises; environmental protection investment; threshold effect; mediator effect; ,"Introduction: Studying the influence and mechanism between environmental regulation, environmental protection investment, and enterprise green technology innovation is crucial to realize ecological civilization construction and sustainable economic growth.Methods: Based on the green patent data and the corresponding enterprise data of A-share heavily polluting industry enterprises from 2010 to 2020, a comprehensive index of environmental regulation is constructed, and the system GMM estimation method, threshold effect test, and intermediary effect model are used. The impact and mechanism of environmental regulation on enterprise green technology innovation are studied, and the heterogeneity of property rights is analyzed.Results: The following conclusions are drawn: 1) Environmental regulation presents a U-shaped relationship of first suppressing and then promoting enterprise green technology innovation, and there is only a single threshold effect, and the inflection point is 2.756. 2) There is an intermediary effect of environmental investment in the impact of environmental regulation on enterprise green technology creation; that is, environmental regulation affects enterprise green technology innovation by affecting the environmental protection investment behavior of enterprises. 3) State-owned enterprises are more sensitive to environmental regulation, and environmental regulation has a greater impact on enterprise green technology innovation.Discussion: These conclusions play an important role in the formulation of environmental policies by governments and in the green development of enterprises.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Design/methodology/approach In this study, a longitudinal analysis of European ICT companies was conducted, contrasting internal knowledge creation, in the form of patent accumulation and research and development (R&D) efforts, with external learning through merger-and-acquisition (M&A) activities to uncover the best strategies for performance maximization. Findings Results suggest that the two knowledge generation strategies are not complementary and demonstrate only marginal impact on organizational performance. However, intriguing patterns in combining the two became apparent. It was found that patent accumulation improves learning achieved through M&A activities, while also acting as a protection against corporate takeover. At the same time, the internal knowledge generation strategy was found to have a negative impact on financial performance, with external knowledge generation demonstrating somewhat mixed results. Practical implications This paper provides practical insights into the patterns of internal and external knowledge generation activities. The two strategies were found not to be complementary, implying that companies must carefully choose their preferences. Originality/value This large-scale study tackles the interplay between internal and external knowledge generation strategies, which are mostly studied separately. It reveals new patterns in corporate acquisition and divestment strategies as sources of new knowledge. It also ties the knowledge paradigm to organizational performance.",2020,Business & Economics,0
"A tale of two property rights: Knowledge, physical assets, and multinational firm boundaries",Multinational firm boundaries; Knowledge dissipation; Hold-up; Intangible assets; IPR protection; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; VERTICAL INTEGRATION; INTERNATIONAL-ORGANIZATION; INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; PATENT PROTECTION; INTRAFIRM TRADE; DETERMINANTS; PATTERN,"The theory of multinational firm boundaries has been shaped by two major paradigms: an earlier one, emphasizing the role of integration in preventing the dissipation of knowledge, and a more recent one, stressing the role of firm boundaries in mitigating underinvestments into relationship-specific assets in the face of contractual incompleteness. This paper develops a novel model encompassing both approaches in a unifying framework. The model predicts that the attractiveness of integration increases in the importance of the parent firm's knowledge capital and decreases in the importance of the affiliates physical capital in a joint production process. Furthermore, stronger intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the affiliate's country is predicted to mitigate the effect of knowledge intensity on the attractiveness of integration. I test these hypotheses using unique panel data on more than 100,000 firm pairs worldwide. In line with the model's predictions, knowledge-intensive parent firms choose higher ownership shares in their affiliates, yet this relationship is less pronounced the stronger the IPR protection in the affiliate's country. In addition, higher physical capital intensity of the affiliate is associated with lower ownership shares. These findings are robust to controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across countries, industries, and firms, providing strong support for the unifying theory of multinational firm boundaries.

Endovascular revascularization of symptomatic chronic total occlusions of the internal carotid artery using a proximal balloon protection device,Chronic internal carotid artery occlusion; endovascular revascularization; a proximal balloon protection device; stroke; morphology; ,"To investigate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of endovascular recanalization for symptomatic chronic internal carotid artery occlusions (ICAO). Thirty patients with symptomatic chronic ICAO were treated using the endovascular recanalization method. Proximal balloon protection devices were used to prevent embolic migration by completely blocking the blood flow. The morphology of the internal carotid artery (ICA) at the occluded segment based on catheter angiography was analyzed. Recanalization of symptomatic chronic internal carotid artery occlusion (CICAO) was successful in 20 of the 30 patients (66.7%). The time required for successful revascularization ranged from 120 to 180 min (mean, 150 min). Of the 20 successful patients, 14 were at the cervical ICAs, and six were at the intracranial ICAs. No permanent complications occurred in our study. Ischemic symptoms related to chronic ICAO did not occur during the 18.3 month follow-up period (range, 12-24 months) in the 20 successful patients. Endovascular revascularization can improve hemodynamic compromise. The treated sites of all 20 successfully recanalized patients were patent on computed tomographic angiography or carotid duplex sonography, and no case with >50% restenosis was observed during the follow-up period. Three patients with failed recanalization had a stroke during the follow-up period. Endovascular revascularization of symptomatic CICAO using a proximal balloon protection device is technically feasible in selected patients, and the outcomes are favorable for patients who benefit from revascularization.",2021,Education & Educational Research; Science & Technology - Other Topics,0

Based on panel data of 377 country/year observations of Chinese listed firms in 29 countries between 2008 and 2020, our results illustrate an inverted U-shaped relationship between the strength of host IPRP institutions and the quantity of China's technology-driven acquisitions. This inverted U-shaped relationship is weakened by home-host economic distance, rather than political distance. Clearly, host-country IPRP matters in Chinese firms' location choices for technology-driven acquisitions and those host countries with IPRP that is either too weak or too strong are unattractive to Chinese acquirers. Our study responds to the debate about the inconsistent findings of IPRP's effects on foreign investments, and enriches the research on springboard internationalization.",2023,Business & Economics,0

We propose a theory of how certain labor market institutions affect diversity, and through that route affect levels of innovation. Specifically, unemployment protection (UP) encourages diversity by reducing the risk burden of a broad range of learning, or human capital investment; for that reason, UP fosters innovation. Employment protection (EP) reduces the risk burden of a much narrower range of learning; for this reason, it will not enhance diversity to the extent UP does, and it may actually depress overall diversity and innovation. Our approach differs from previous research on labor market insurance and skill formation, much of which has dealt with a distinction between general and specific skills, and which has treated the effects of UP and EP as similar. Estimating the effects of UP and EP on patenting for 25 OECD countries over 24 years, we find a positive effect from UP, a negative effect from EP, and evidence that the UP effect is mediated by diversity of skill.",2020,Business & Economics,0

The field test program included environmental monitoring of weather data, temperature, water-air regimes, salinity, alkalinity, and biological activity of various soils (sandy and loamy sandy Arenosols, Retisols, loamy Serozems), productivity and yield of plants (lawns, vegetables) and their quality, including pathogen infestation. The evolutionary line of polymer superabsorbents from radiation-crosslinked polyacrylamide (1995) to the patented Aquapastus material (2014-2020) with amphiphilic fillers and biocidal additives demonstrated not only success, but also the main problems of using hydrogels in soils (biodegradation, osmotic collapse, etc.), as well as their technological solutions. Along with innovative materials, our know-how consisted in the intelligent soil design of capillary barriers for water accumulation and antipathogenic and antielectrolyte protection of the rhizosphere. Gel-forming polymer conditioners and new technologies of their application increase the productivity of plant crops and the quality of biomass by 30-50%, with a 1.3-2-fold saving of water resources and reliable protection of the topsoil from pathogens and secondary salinization.

Integrating the sustainable entrepreneurship literature with the attention-based view, we show that country-level climate impact redirects managerial attention to the disruptive potential of climate change and spurs the sector into action to pursue and protect CCA-related IP. We also find that strong intellectual-property rights regulations and environmental movements in countries strengthen this effect. Our results extend the sustainable entrepreneurship literature by showing how the geography of climate impact explains how CCA IP protection efforts are distributed globally.Executive summary: Why do entrepreneurs in some countries engage in more climate change adaptation (CCA) intellectual property (IP) protection than others? We postulate that entrepreneurs' attention is simultaneously situated in their country's climatic and institutional environments, and that these contexts shape the salience of CCA IP protection. Formally, we predict that entrepreneurs who would normally deprioritize CCA IP protection as an opportunity in the face of more urgent socioeconomic issues become more attuned to it as their country's climate impact increases. We then theorize institutional conditions that influence entrepreneurs' responsiveness to climate impact. First, we predict that stronger intellectual property rights institutions reduce entrepreneurs' uncertainty in capturing rents from their CCA IP and hence strengthen the relationship between climate impact and CCA IP protection. Second, we predict that informal institutions aligned with environmental movements increase the salience of climate impacts to corporate entrepreneurs by spurring their interests in environmental issues and hence also strengthen the climate impact-CCA IP protection relationship. Our empirical analyses using 689 country-year observations consisting of 95 countries over the period 2005 to 2015 reveal that country-level climate impact drives CCA IP protection, especially when there are strong intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes and environmental movements.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Results of Angioplasty With Double-Layer Mesh Stent and Protection Systems of the Extra- and Intracranial Dissection of Cephalic Arteries,dissection; carotid artery; mesh stent; proximal protection system; distal protection system; ENDOVASCULAR MANAGEMENT; OCCLUSION; STROKE; PREVENTION; COMMUNITY; OUTCOMES; RISK,"Purpose: Although a majority of cervical artery dissections can be managed conservatively, patients presenting with cerebral embolization or significant stenosis require a more aggressive approach. However, complications associated with endovascular repair are quite frequent and optimal interventional technique still remains to be established. Materials and methods: The aim of this post hoc survey was to analyze results of endovascular treatments for symptomatic dissections of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, which were performed under protection and with the use of double-layer mesh stents. During endovascular procedure catheters, stents and protection systems were tailored according to the angioarchitecture of dissection, particularly to its location, length and coexisting stenotic or aneurysmatic lesions. We evaluated retrospectively midterm and late results of endovascular treatment of 25 patients presenting with symptomatic dissection of cervical arteries, including 11 patients with dissections of intracranial segments of the internal carotid artery. Follow-ups were scheduled 1, 3 and 6 after the procedure, and then every 6 months. Control computed tomography (CT) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) arteriographies were performed 1-6 months and 12 months after endovascular repair. Results: There were no periprocedural major adverse events. All patients completed the 12-month follow-up. There were neither fatalities nor new neurologic adverse events at the 30-day follow-up, and no such adverse events during long-term follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, in all patients, angiographies revealed patent stents, full coverage of lesions by stents and complete thrombotic closure of the pseudoaneurysms. Conclusions: A tailored endovascular management of symptomatic dissection of cervical arteries is safe and efficient, also in a long run.",2023,Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,0
Strategizing Intellectual Property Rights for Enhanced Innovation: the Moderating Effects of R&D and FDI in China's Regional Context,IPR protection intensity; Technological innovation; Dual mediators; R&D investment; Foreign direct investment (FDI); FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; SPILLOVERS; TRADE; APPROPRIABILITY; PROTECTION,"This study investigates the strategic role of intellectual property rights (IPR) in driving technological innovation in China, focusing on the impact of research and development (R&D) and foreign direct investment (FDI) in different regional contexts. Given the critical importance of understanding how enhanced IPR protection can stimulate technological progress in emerging economies like China, this research addresses theoretical and practical gaps by proposing a region-specific approach to IPR strategy, considering the unique dynamics of R&D and FDI. Analyzing data from 21 Chinese provinces, cities, and autonomous regions from 2007 to 2019 using a fixed-effects model, the findings highlight that stronger IPR protection significantly boosts domestic technological innovation by motivating R&D efforts, which in turn increases the rate of invention patent applications. However, the study uncovers a complex interaction where increased IPR stringency might deter FDI flows, negatively impacting the IPR-innovation relationship. Furthermore, the interplay between FDI and R&D can hinder innovation outcomes, with the Western region of China being particularly affected by FDI's influence on innovation, in contrast to the Eastern and Central regions. These insights emphasize the necessity of aligning IPR protection with R&D and FDI policies to create an innovation ecosystem conducive to sustained technological development. This research contributes to the existing literature by offering empirical evidence on the optimal configuration of IPR, R&D, and FDI strategies for fostering innovation, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the knowledge economy.",2024,Business & Economics,0
The analogue substitution model: Introducing competition in the absence of generic substitution in Danish hospitals,Cost-effectiveness; Pharmaceuticals; Substitution; Stakeholder collaboration; Analogue medicines; MEDICINES; BELGIUM; PRICES,"Increasingly advanced medicines have created monopolies in treatment areas with no viable options for generic substitution due to patent protection. As health care systems are increasingly under pressure to deliver health care improvements, costs become prohibitive as budgets are under pressure. To create financial flexibility, Danish regional authorities have over the period from 2009 until today developed, implemented, and gradually increased the use of a new model for analogue medicine substitution. The model introduces competitive tenders among patented medicines by declaring these medicines therapeutically equivalent in the treatment of specific diseases and thereby creating new opportunities for reducing annual medicine expenses. The model is based on enhanced collaboration among the health technology assessment (HTA) body, the procurement body, and the hospital owner, and it effectively covers medicine expenditure and cost-effectiveness while ensuring standardized treatments across hospitals and regions. The model is internationally unique in integrating several healthcare stakeholders and balancing their respective agendas to generate optimized outcomes for the healthcare system as a whole. However, some challenges persist, as the HTA process is resource and time consuming.

IP dLedger - Decentralized ledger for intellectual property administration,Blockchain; Decentralized ledger; Database; Hyperlink Intellectual property; PATENT HARMONIZATION; BLOCKCHAIN; PROTECTION; MARKET; IMPACT; IDEAS; FIELD,"With the rapid growth of big data, the applications of intellectual property (IP) rights and prior art documents are increasing rapidly. Patent examiners are usually overworked to evaluate inventions referring to a large volume of prior arts in a short period. Such increasing workloads and documents may cause administrative inefficiencies and generate low-quality IPs that hamper technological innovation. Moreover, today's centralized IP administration system is inefficient in processing speed, security, and cost. Inefficiencies of IP administration in each national IP office impede speedy and efficient cooperation for international application and registration. This study proposes an IP decentralized ledger (IP dLedger) based on the blockchain to significantly reduce IP administration costs and improve IP use. IP dLedger connects the on-chain (blockchain) to the off-chain (centralized database) systems using IP codes that combine hash values and timestamps. Similar to the web hypertext method, this connective feature of IP dLedger enables users who click on identification information registered in a blockchain network to access, through a hyperlink, a centralized database of enormous volumes of related IP information. Therefore, IP dLedger can reduce IP administration costs, increase IP usage, and facilitate safe and convenient use of the IP data.",2023,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0
Trade Policy Uncertainty and Medical Innovation: Evidence from Developing Nations,trade policy; uncertainty; innovation; patents; developing nations; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; LONG-RUN; PRODUCTIVITY; INVESTMENT; HEALTH; IRREVERSIBILITY; COINTEGRATION; PROTECTION; DYNAMICS; EXPORTS,"This study explores the influence of trade policy uncertainty on medical innovation investment in developing nations from 1980 to 2020, with a focus on the period of COVID-19. We used exogenous and heterogeneous exposure to trade-policy-uncertainty resolutions from developing countries' trade policy adjustments, which reduced tariff hikes on imported goods in a double difference-in-differences method. ARDL with PVAR has been studied for long-run and short-run analyses. The findings revealed that reducing tariff uncertainty boosts innovation beyond patent filings and margin reaction and exports. Long-term impacts of sectoral innovation patterns, governmental changes, and foreign technology entering developing nations have little effect on the findings. This paper also shows a long-term link between medical innovation, trade policy uncertainty, and research-and-development spending. Innovation's negative response to the innovation shock and research and development's positive response corroborates bidirectional and unidirectional causality. This study contributes to medical innovation and policy uncertainty in terms of developing countries and, most importantly, in trends of medical innovation, contemporaneous policy uncertainty given the inflow of foreign technology, and the importance of that technology recent times.",2022,Business & Economics,0
EFFECTS OF GEOGRAPHICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROXIMITIES ON COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY ON CHINA'S STEEL INDUSTRY,technological proximity; geographical proximity; collaborative innovation; steel; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; NETWORK; PERFORMANCE; CLUSTERS,"Being two important dimensions of organizational proximities, geographical and technological proximities may exert interactive effects on innovation performance except their individual effects. However, few studies have examined the interaction. To identify the influences of geographical and technological proximities on the collaborative innovation, we extracted a total of 6,547 jointly filed patents in the fields of energy conservation, environmental protection and recycling in China's steel industry during 2009-2017 via the Patent Information Service Platform to construct collaborative innovation networks. A negative binomial regression model was employed to verify the independent and interactive influences of technological and geographical proximities on the collaborative innovation, as well as the moderating effect of network density on these links. Results show that compared with geographical proximity, technological proximity can improve the collaborative innovation remarkably and the interaction between multidimensional proximities can influence collaborative innovation more evidently than a single proximity. For the moderating effect, network density positively moderates the U-shape relationship between technological proximity and collaborative innovation output. Conclusions identify the effects of single proximity and interaction between multidimensional proximities on collaborative innovation and provide a reference for innovative organizations to reasonably allocate multidimensional proximities to improve the performance of innovation networks.",2020,Business & Economics,0

Using a unique Chinese Patent Census Database to identify the quantity and quality of GI in each province and panel data for Chinese industrial sector in 30 provinces from 2002 to 2015, we investigated the impact of environmental regulation (ER) on GI in China. This study presents the first attempt to identify green innovation quality in China. Empirical results show that there is an inverted-U relationship between ER and GI. The heterogenous effects are further investigated in order to obtain more accurate policy implications. The results indicate that the impact of ER on GI is insignificant in the central and western regions, implying the necessity of adjusting ER policies in these regions. Second, the invertedU-shaped relationship between ER and GI only occurred in provinces with high state-owned enterprise (SOE) ratio, figuring out the special role of Chinese SOEs in promoting GI.

When Sino-American Struggle Disrupts the Supply Chain: Licensing Intellectual Property in a Changing Trade Environment,Industrial Policy; Licensing; Techno-Nationalism; Trade Policy; ,"Through legislative changes, tariff wars, and executive actions, the Trump Administration has injected a new urgency into international technology and supply chain management, particularly between the United States and China. Analytically, the situation invites a perspective that links practical/on-the-ground responses by commercial actors in the politics of technological competition between superpowers, i.e. a discussion that bridges the gap between policy and process. This article therefore approaches management of supply chain disruption in terms of a key security issue motivating recent changes to the trade environment: the protection of intellectual property. After reviewing critical policy developments and trade statistics, we draw upon data on IP-intensive industries from global patent offices, trade classifications for products made by these IP-intensive industries, and concordance data on patent classifications to illustrate the centrality of IP to extended supply chains. With these key relationships in mind, we outline specific opportunities that intellectual property licensing provides for managing supply chain linkages between the United States and China in the current geopolitical environment. Viewing intellectual property as both a driver of and a solution to trade difficulties highlights the sorts of cross-jurisdictional nuances that can better inform policy and business decisions alike in the broader international trade regime.",2021,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,0

This paper investigates the relationship between environmental innovation and environmental sustainability in a Nordic country, Norway, from 1990:Q1 to 2019:Q4. In Norway, climate change, protection of the ozone layer, biodiversity, urbanization, acidification, eutrophication, persistently high toxic waste, and increased fragility have injected volatility and uncertainty into the Norwegians-a reality that may continue for a while. This study is unique in that it uses the nonlinear ARDL approach to analyze in depth how environmental innovation affects environmental sustainability in Norway while controlling for economic growth, renewable energy, and financial development. In particular, the findings reveal that (i) environmental innovation improves the environment in Norway over long-term horizons; (ii) strengthening patents on environmental innovations can foster clean living, green growth, and zero CO2 emissions; (iii) investing in renewable energy sources benefits the Norwegian environment by reducing carbon emission growth; and (iv) economic growth and financial development promote CO2 emission growth. The policy consequence is that Norway's policymakers should continue to invest in cleaner technologies and encourage environmental education and training of employees, suppliers, and consumers.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Epistemic competition in global governance: The case of pharmaceutical patents,; KNOWLEDGE; POLITICS; COMMUNITIES; CONFLICT; REGIME; ACCESS; IDEAS,"Expert consensus helps policymakers solve complex problems by identifying and legitimizing policy solutions. Yet, persistent hesitation remains among policymakers regarding the technically adequate policy solution despite the existence and mobilization of epistemic communities. This paper contends that more attention should be given to studying the epistemic competition that may arise when multiple epistemic communities grapple with the same problem but have divergent understandings of its technical nature and its adequate policy solutions. Building on Science and Technology Studies and on the literature on polarization, this paper suggests that two social dynamics, namely the mobilization of resources and increased polarization, may complexify the technical disagreement among experts. In turn, these dynamics may lead to a deadlock in the debates, negatively impacting the institutional context where they take place. To illustrate this, this paper analyzes the case of the pharmaceutical innovation system, which has been prone to tensions between experts arguing for strong patent protection and experts arguing for greater flexibility to meet public health needs. This paper builds on a mixed method combining a social network analysis of experts invited to provide their expertise in the WHO-WTO-WIPO Trilateral Cooperation events and on semi-structured interviews with 24 of these experts.",2024,International Relations; Government & Law,0

The baseline result shows that inflexibility is positively associated with innovation activities. In the mechanism analyses, we find that the positive relationship is mainly driven by firms with higher contraction inflexibility and in less stable external environments. The positive relationship is also stronger for firms in industries with higher concentration, and in economies with stronger creditor rights. Finally, we observe a weaker relationship in multinational enterprises.

The findings of the article indicate that: (1) EVMR can significantly promote enterprise green innovation. This conclusion still holds after controlling for endogeneity and conducting other robustness tests. (2) In terms of the mechanism, EVMR primarily promotes green innovation by improving the supervisory capacity of provincial-level environmental protection departments, the enforcement capacity of grassroots environmental protection departments, and the incentives and supervision for managers from shareholders in enterprises.

DISCLOSURE OF ORIGIN OF PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES: CHALLENGES FOR SUPPORTING FOOD SECURITY IN INDONESIA,Dislosure of origin; Benefit sharing; Plant genetic resources; Agriculture; Biopiracy; Food security; ,"Protecting plant genetic resources is crucial because they are a key element in supporting food security for Indonesia's growing population. An important element in the protection of plant genetic resources is the disclosure of origin of genetic resources. In line with international standards and commitments, Indonesia has enacted a Patents Act that seeks to protect its plant genetic resources by requiring disclosure of origin. However it is one thing to enact legislation and quite a different thing to effectively implement the legislation to achieve its aims. This paper critically analyses the Indonesian Patent Act and highlights some key issues that undermine the effectivenss of the Act. The paper identifies the problems of implementing provisions of the Act at the normative and practical levels. At the normative, the Act lacks clarity with concepts undefined. This is compounded at the paractical level by a lack of a regulatory framework and inadequate human resources. The paper suggests that given the importance of disclosure of origin in protecting plant genetic resources for Indonesia's food security, developing further legislative and institutional framework on disclosure of origin is an esential strategic solution for the country.",2020,Business & Economics,0
DOIN: a novel electronic personal dosemeter for neutrons,; FACILITY; HOTNES,"Electronic personal dosemeters (EPD) are powerful tools for achieving ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) objectives in operational radiation protection. EPD for photons are well developed and their performances usually comply with relevant Standards. By contrast, a very few commercial models exist for neutrons and their energy dependence is too large for using them without pre-information on the workplace neutron spectrum. Within the INFN-based DOIN (DOsimetro Indossabile per Neutroni) project, a new EPD for neutrons was prototyped. Owing to a new patented design, a good dose response was achieved in the energy interval from thermal neutrons up to the quality of (24)1Am-Be. The response is nearly isotropic and, if compared to commercial models, exhibits higher sensitivity.",2023,Physics,0
The Approach of The Court of Justice of the European Union Towards the Protection of Three-Dimensional Marks,Trade Mark; Three-Dimensional Shape; Non-Traditional Mark; Distinctiveness; Nature of Goods; Technical Result; EU Trade Mark Directive; EU Trade Mark Regulation; The Court of Justice of the European Union Case Law; ,"Three-dimensional shapes are the most common type of non-traditional marks becoming widespread. Especially in the last two decades, trade mark applications regarding the protection of three-dimensional shapes have increased significantly. Assessment for the registration of three-dimensional shape marks is no different from other marks types, as the Court of Justice of the European Union suggests. However, in addition to standard trade mark protection requirements, three-dimensional shapes must fulfil additional criteria. The EU Trade Mark Regulation and the EU Trade Mark Directive include special provisions for three-dimensional marks. According to the law, three-dimensional shapes which result from the nature of the goods, are necessary to obtain a technical result, or give substantial value to the goods, are excluded from trade mark protection in the EU. The Court of Justice of the European Union is quite strict in interpreting the abovementioned criteria for three-dimensional shape marks. As an inherent result, obtaining trade mark protection for three-dimensional shapes becomes increasingly difficult for proprietors. The CJEU gives particular importance to the public interest clause and ensures that common shapes keep open for competition in the market since shapes are finite and certain shapes are in common use. The CJEU justifies the conduct by claiming that time-restricted intellectual property rights such as patent or design rights should not be extended through the trade mark route for specific products. The first and second subsections of the exclusion seem to be appropriate. However, the third exclusion is problematic due to its wording and interpretation by the CJEU. Thus, this study suggests that narrowing the scope of the third subsection would fit the purposes of trade mark protection regarding three-dimensional shapes.",2022,Government & Law,0
Trans-Distal Radial Artery Carotid Revascularization with Forearm Flow Reversal: An Alternative Option of CAS in the TCAR Era,Carotid artery stenosis; Flow reversal; Trans-Distal radial approach; Trans-Radial approach; CORONARY-ANGIOGRAPHY; TRANSRADIAL ACCESS; FEMORAL ACCESS; ENDARTERECTOMY; METAANALYSIS; INTERVENTION; ASSOCIATION; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES; BOVINE,"BACKGROUND: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) has emerged as an alternative to carotid artery stenting (CAS). TCAR demonstrated its superiority by avoiding femoral artery puncture and establishing proximal protection without crossing the stenotic lesion. In the TCAR era, we focused on the possibility of a trans-distal radial approach (DRA). A balloon-guide catheter was navigated via DRA to establish proximal protection before lesion crossing. The forearm subcutaneous vein was used as the flow-reversal circuit. METHODS: Six internal carotid artery stenosis patients u nderwent CAS using the forearm flow reversal techn ique.  Every procedure was performed under continuous flow reversal from the common carotid artery to the forearm cephalic vein. RESULTS: Successful revascularization was achieved without ischemic or access-site complications. The distal radial artery was patent at discharge in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Trans-distal radial CAS with forearm flow reversal is a feasible and less invasive technical option.",2024,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,0
Requirements for biosimilar authorization: a legal and comparative perspective - FDA versus EMA,Authorization; biosimilar medicines; legal perspective; regulatory framework; INTERCHANGEABILITY; MEDICINES; DRUGS; INDIA,"Both European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have developed a regulatory framework for the authorization of biosimilar medicines. Marketing authorization application must demonstrate that the biosimilar proposed has similar physicochemical, biological, clinical and non-clinical profiles to a reference biological medicine, which could be marketed upon expiration of the patent and data protection period of the innovative medicine. Although the basic principles to demonstrate biosimilarity are equivalent, there are significant differences in certain aspects. The biosimilarity criteria have not remained static, observing a reduction in the regulatory requirements established by EMA. On the other hand, several proposals concerning the amendment of biosimilarity demonstration have been suggested.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0

Migration and Imitation,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PATENT PROTECTION; SKILLED IMMIGRATION; INNOVATION; PRODUCT; QUALITY; VARIETY; REFORMS; TRADE,"This paper develops a North-South trade model with heterogeneous labour and horizontally differentiated products, and compares the implications of two policies: Southern intellectual property rights (IPR) and Northern immigration policy, with the latter aiming to attract Southern talent as a means of pre-empting imitation. Individuals self-select into becoming entrepreneurs and innovate (imitate) in the North (South). The likelihood of imitation depends on product quality, imitator's talent and IPR strength. Several interrelated channels of competition are identified. Allowing high-talent migration when IPR protection in the South is weak shifts imitation to low-quality products and innovation to high-quality products. The outcome is in stark contrast to the policy of strengthening Southern IPR, which limits low-talent imitation in the South and encourages low-quality innovation in the North. Migration also increases the income of low-talent entrepreneurs, as well as the average quality of products imitated by high-talent entrepreneurs in the South. Global income rises with migration, but is not guaranteed to rise with stronger Southern IPR.",2023,Business & Economics,0

Employing the unexpected departure of mutual fund managers and the inclusion of the Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 index as identifications, we find that institutional investor networks have a positive impact on firm innovation. Specifically, firms that are hold by well-connected institutional investors are motivated to make R & D investments and receive greater patents than their counterparts. This positive influence is more pronounced for non-SOEs and for firms located in less-developed regions, indicating that institutional investor networks act as information flow facilitator and a value certifier to encourage innovation activities.",2023,Business & Economics,0

Iron oxides in novel skin care formulations attenuate blue light for enhanced protection against skin damage,high‐ energy visible light; iron oxides; photoaging of the skin; photoprotection; VISIBLE-LIGHT; PIGMENTATION; MELASMA; IMPACT,"Background Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a main cause of aging of sun-exposed skin, but greater attention is being focused on the damaging effects of high-energy visible (HEV) light (400 and 500 nm). HEV light exposure has increased with expanding use of consumer electronics, such as smartphones, which have a peak emission in the 400-490 nm range. Sunscreens containing titanium dioxide and zinc oxide protect against UVA and UVB radiation but provide limited protection against HEV light. Aim Iron oxides including red iron oxide (Fe2O3), yellow iron oxide (Fe(OH)(3)/FeOOH), and black iron oxide (Fe3O4) effectively block HEV light, each with a different attenuation profile. Zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and iron oxides with patented skin care ingredients have been incorporated into several formulations to provide enhanced skin protection (Colorescience, Inc). Methods The percent of HEV light attenuation from 400 nm to 490 nm light was measured in vitro using a technique known as diffuse transmittance spectroscopy using a Perkin Elmer Lambda (TM) 750 UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer equipped with a 100-mm integrating Labsphere(R) and PbS detector. Results Products formulated with zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and iron oxides demonstrated 71.9%-85.6% attenuation across the tested wavelengths of 415-465 nm. Conclusion Sunscreens formulated with iron oxides provide enhanced protection against blue light, especially when combined with zinc oxide. To our knowledge, similar studies with iron oxides have not been performed.",2021,Dermatology,0
The Use of a New Ionic Derivative of Salicylic Acid in Sugar Beet Cultivation,organic salts; salicylic acid; plant stimulant; plant resistance inducer; sugar beet cultivation; Cercospora leaf spot; technological sugar yield; CERCOSPORA-BETICOLA; RESISTANCE,"The need for sustainable development in the context of pesticide use has been recognized by the European Union. The Farm to Fork Strategy indicates a goal of 50% reduction in pesticide use by 2030. To address this challenge, we used the concept of ionic liquids to modify known resistance inducers, i.e., a group of substances whose action is indicated as an alternative to fungicides. A new, patented substance developed by us, which is a choline 3,5-dichlorosalicylate, has been tested in the context of its use in sugar beet cultivation with the aim of controlling Cercospora leaf spot (CLS). The results suggest that the use of this substance in combination with one fungicide treatment reduces disease infection and produces yields very similar to the use of a standard protection program assuming the use of two fungicides. Such results provide the basis for further development of 3,5-dichlorosalicylate in terms of its use in agriculture. Thanks to its use, it was possible to resign from one fungicide treatment, while maintaining protection against CLS and yields at the same level as for the full fungicide protection program. Such an approach is in line with European Union policies.",2024,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,0

Willowood, LLC United States Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit, 2019 No. 2018-1614, 2019 WL 6884529, _F.3d _",; ,"Syngenta markets fungicide products containing the active ingredient azoxystrobin. Willowood filed applications with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to register generic me-too'' versions of Syngenta's azoxystrobin-based products, and Syngenta sued for copyright infringement, based on Willowood's copying of Syngenta's corresponding product labels. The district court dismissed the copyright claims, finding that because the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) contemplates copying by a generic applicant in ways that would otherwise infringe copyright, Congress intended a narrow exception to copyright protection for the required elements of a fungicide label. On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed, holding that unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act, which requires a generic drug to have essentially the same label as its branded counterpart, FIFRA does not necessarily mandate that a generic fungicide use the same label as its branded counterpart, and for that reason does not necessarily preempt the Copyright Act. The district court further found that Syngenta had not proven that Willowood infringed patents claiming methods of manufacturing azoxystrobin under 35 U.S.C. 271(g), based on the court's assumption that 271(g) infringement requires that a single entity perform all of the steps of a claimed method. The Federal Circuit reversed, holding that while 271(a) does require all of the steps of an infringing process to be attributable to a single party, there is no such limitation on 271(g). The Federal Circuit pointed out that the infringing act creating liability under 271(g) is the importation into the U.S. of a product manufactured using a process that is patented in the U.S., and that Congress did not intend to limit the application of 271(g) to situations in which a single entity performs all of the steps of the claimed method.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0
Decision-Making of Closed-Loop Supply Chain Strategic Alliance Considering the Quality Level of Remanufactured Products and Patent Protection,Closed-loop supply chain; strategic alliance structure; quality level of remanufactured products; patent protection; Stackelberg game; PRICE-COMPETITION; COOPERATION; RISK,"In this paper, a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a third-party remanufacturer responsible for collecting used products and remanufacturing is constructed. Considering the quality level of remanufactured products, four kinds of closed-loop supply chain alliance structure models are constructed. The optimal equilibrium decisions of these four models are compared and analyzed. The optimal decisions of the models are verified by numerical analysis. Furthermore, the impacts of the quality of remanufactured products and the decision influence of the third-party remanufacturer in the alliance on the remanufacturer's decision are further analyzed. The results show that remanufactured products are competitive with new products, and the improvement of the remanufactured product quality will reduce the market demand of new products. The equilibrium decision of the closed-loop supply chain is affected by the alliance behavior of members in the closed-loop supply chain and the quality level of remanufactured products. The higher the decision concentration of the closed-loop supply chain is, the more favorable the supply chain is; the higher the remanufacturing quality level is, the more favorable the supply chain is, and the alliance decision of the third-party remanufacturer is affected by the quality level of remanufactured products and the decision-making influence of the third-party remanufacturer in the alliance structure. We find that the improvement of the concentration degree of closed-loop supply chain decision can benefit the supply chain by improving the remanufacturing quality level, which has direct effect on the alliance decision of the third-party remanufacturer. in most cases, the choice of the alliance is the dominant decision of the third-party remanufacturer.",2020,Operations Research & Management Science,0

Trade Secrets: Promoting Innovation in Biosimilars,; APPROVAL; COMPETITION; PROTECTION; ECONOMICS; PATENTS; GUIDE; LAW,"Trade secrets are generally considered as stifling innovation, including the innovation of biosimilars. This article considers the alternative and suggests that trade secrets over biologics not only promote, but actually force biosimilar innovation. Specifically, trade secrets encourage biosimilars to innovate in two areas: process design and analytical science. Both areas of innovation are related to the unique nature of biologics and biosimilars and their molecular size, complexity and heterogeneity. However, it is not enough to say that the secret nature of originator manufacturing processes promotes innovation. This article will show that biosimilars may not only innovate in the sense of allowing cumulative innovation in analytical techniques for biopharmaceutical characterisation, but originator trade secrets also promote a different kind of innovation in biosimilar development processes: simultaneous innovation.",2021,Government & Law,0

Innovation Options and Profitability of Pharmaceutical Brand Manufacturers,Drugs; Pharmaceutical industry; Product innovation; Profitability; Research and development; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PRODUCT INNOVATION; PATENTS; PERFORMANCE; RETURNS; IMPACT; DRUGS,"Much research exists covering clinical development success rates, development costs of new drugs, and market launch impact on stock market valuation of companies, but little systematic work has been done to establish the impact of research input on new product launches and, in turn, their impact on profitability of drug manufacturers. This article investigates these relations using data from the world's largest pharmaceutical brand manufacturers and their product launches in the US over a period of more than 25 years. The objective is to determine the impact of innovation intensity on innovation output intensity and of innovation output intensity on profitability. It is shown that there is a complete lack of evidence that launches of New Molecular Entities (NMEs) necessarily lead to higher profitability, suggesting that many launches of NMEs are not particularly successful from an economic point of view. Furthermore, it was found that intangible knowledge assets acquired by company mergers and acquisitions do often not live up to their valuation. This leads to the conclusion that such intangible assets seem to be overpriced on average. The more and more frequently used strategy of launching new drugs without NMEs like combination drugs or extension of indications increased short-term profitability making this a valid approach to avoid setbacks when patent protection of blockbuster drugs expires.",2022,Engineering,0

Developing an institutional theory of country image, the authors argue that weak legal institutions at the country level increase firm opportunistic behavior that expropriates consumers and decrease the product quality of local brands, thus decreasing the country's image regarding its products and brands. Design/methodology/approach This study measures country image for products and brands using the number of valuable brands (i.e. brands included in the top 500 brands from 2008 to 2016) in a particular home country. Data concerning the rule of law in each country come from the World Bank, and data on the efficiency of countries' judicial systems comes from Djankovet al.(2007). We also collect patent data from the US Patent and Trade Office, national culture from Hofstede Insights and GDP and GDP per capita from the World Bank as control variables. Panel Poisson regression, Tobit regression and truncated regression are used in the analyses. Findings Supporting the institutional theory of country image, both the rule of law and efficiency of the judicial systems show positive and significant effects on country image, even when economy size (GDP), degree of economic development (GDP per capita), level of technology and skill (patents) and culture are controlled. Practical implications To improve their country's image and the brand value of local firms, policymakers should strive to strengthen legal institutions aimed at punishing firm opportunistic behavior in their countries.

Open knowledge commons versus privatized gain in a fractured information ecology: lessons from COVID-19 for the future of sustainability,COVID-19; information ecology; innovation; intellectual property; knowledge commons; patents; ANTICOMMONS; INNOVATION; PROPERTY,"COVID-19 has shone a bright light on a number of failings and weaknesses in how current economic models handle information and knowledge. Some of these are familiar issues that have long been understood but not acted upon effectively - for example, the danger that current systems of intellectual property and patent protection are actually inimical to delivering a cost-effective vaccine available to all, whereas treating knowledge as a commons and a public good is much more likely to deliver efficient outcomes for the entire global population. But COVID-19 has also demonstrated that traditional models of knowledge production and dissemination are failing us; scientific knowledge is becoming weaponized and hyper-partisan, and confidence in this knowledge is falling. We believe that the challenges that COVID-19 has exposed in the information economy and ecology will be of increasing applicability across the whole spectrum of sustainability; sustainability scholars and policymakers need to understand and grasp them now if we are to avoid contagion into other sectors due to the preventable errors that have marred the global response to COVID-19.

Accessing Affordable Medicines in a Post-TRIPS Environment: The Case of Bangladesh,Affordable medicines; Bangladesh; Bangladeshi pharmaceutical industry; generic drugs; Least Developed Countries (LDCs); MNCs; TRIPS; WTO; ,"The cost of medicines in Bangladesh is among the lowest in the world. Over the last forty years, Bangladesh, a Least Developed Country (LDC), has nurtured a local industry based on strong industrial policy and a pharmaceutical patent-free system. Of the 46 LDCs in the world, it is the only one to have a thriving industry of this kind. In this paper, we explore how a relatively poor LDC managed to take on the dominance of MNCs in the global production of pharmaceuticals. We focus on the 1982 National Drug Policy (NDP) which transformed the pharmaceutical sector in Bangladesh from one in which three-quarters of drugs were supplied by just eight MNCs to one where almost all domestic demand is met by local industry. The thriving local pharmaceutical industry also exports generic medicines to 147 different countries. In 2026, Bangladesh is due to graduate to 'Developing Country' status, at which time, as a member of the WTO, Bangladesh will have to abide by the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement. Under TRIPS it will have to change its patent regime to allow for the registration of pharmaceutical patents by 2029. Using interview data with key Bangladeshi experts, we argue that TRIPS compliance could potentially wipe out this flourishing local pharmaceutical industry, leading to steep increases in the cost of essential medicines, with dire implications for the right to health. We explore policy options open to the Bangladesh government to protect affordable drugs in the country, in particular protection for the production of domestic generics in a post-TRIPS environment. We also argue that there are ways in which Bangladesh and India could co-operate to protect the affordability of high-quality medicines for domestic and international markets.",2021,Area Studies; History; Asian Studies,0
Corporate Innovation and Dividend Payout Policy: Evidence From China's Listed Companies,Technological innovation; Patents; Research and development; Stock markets; Investment; Companies; Manufacturing; Corporate activities; financial management; innovation management; ,"Using the sample of China's listed companies, this study investigates the effect of corporate innovation on dividend payout policy. We expect that managers from more-innovative firms would have more confidence in future corporate performance, and hence, be more motivated to signal future profitability in stock market through distributing cash dividends. Employing the number of effective patents to measure corporate innovation, we find that the propensity to pay cash dividends is higher among more-innovative firms. Moreover, more-innovative firms usually pay more cash dividends to their shareholders than that of less-innovative firms. The empirical results are robust to different model specifications and to various subsamples based on firm size. This study emphasizes the importance of stimulating corporate innovation in both domestic economic growth and shareholder protection. This study sheds light on the role of corporate innovation in major corporate decisions in China, which is the largest emerging economy in the world. Moreover, the empirical findings of this study also have a policy implication to Chinese regulatory bodies who have been urging firms listed in domestic stock exchanges to pay cash dividends. Regulatory bodies may spend more effort on encouraging innovation, as corporate innovation motivates the managers of listed firms to distribute profits to shareholders.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,0

We combine unique survey data that incorporates a representative sample of Polish manufacturing companies with data on the state aid from the State Aid Data Sharing System (SUDOP). Our results confirm the positive role of R&D&I subsidies on the likelihood of applying for a patent, filing for intellectual property protection for utility models, industrial designs, trademark registrations, and the introduction of process innovations, consistent with the existing literature. However, the results also indicate an insignificant impact of the intervention on firms' R&D expenditures and product innovations. The extension of the analysis with the moderating effects of internal factors that affect the firms' innovative behavior indicates that the R&D&I subsidies for exporters lead to the crowding-out effect and for non-exporters generate additional R&D expenditures and increase the propensity for R&D cooperation. Furthermore, R&D&I support for enterprises with foreign ownership reduces their propensity for patent applications and product innovations.

Chelator Regulation of In Situ Calcium Availability to Enable Spray-Dry Microencapsulation in Cross-Linked Alginates,; HYALURONIC-ACID; LINKING,"A recently patented one-step in situ cross-linked alginate microencapsulation (CLAM) by spray-drying (i.e., the UC Davis CLAMs technology) can overcome the high cost of scale-up that limits commercial applications. While increasing calcium loading in the CLAMs process can increase the extent of cross-linking and improve retention and protection of the encapsulated cargo, the potential for residual undissolved calcium salt crystals in the final product can be a concern for some applications. Here, we demonstrate an alternate one-step spray-dry CLAMs process using pH-responsive chelation of calcium. The Chelate CLAMs process is an improvement over the patented process that controls ion availability based on pH-responsive solubility of the calcium salt. Hyaluronic acid was encapsulated in CLAMs to minimize swelling and release in aqueous formulations. CLAMs with 61% (d.b.) hyaluronic acid (HA-CLAMs) demonstrated restricted plumping, limited water absorption capacity, and reduced leaching, retaining up to 49% hyaluronic acid after 2 h in water. Alternatively, Chelate HA-CLAMs formed by the improved process exhibited nearly full retention of hyaluronic acid over 2 h in water and remained visibly insoluble after 1 year of storage in water at 4 degrees C. Successful hyaluronic acid retention in CLAMs is likely due in part to its ability to cross-link with calcium.",2020,Chemistry,0
Impact mechanism of environmental protection tax policy on enterprises' green technology innovation with quantity and quality from the micro-enterprise perspective,Environmental tax; Green technology innovation; Green patent; Environmental regulation; REGULATION PROMOTE; CHINA; PRODUCTIVITY; PRESSURES,"Promoting green technology innovation through environmental tax is an important tool to achieve green development. Based on the data of Chinese listed companies from 2010 to 2020, this research examines the impact mechanisms of environmental tax policies on the quality and quantity of enterprise green technology innovation from the micro-enterprise perspective. The underlying mechanisms and heterogeneous effects were analyzed empirically using pooled OLS model and the mediated effects model. The results indicate that the environmental tax policy has an inhibitory effect on the quantity and quality of green patents, and the impact on the quantity is more significant. The mechanism analysis suggests that the environmental tax inhibits green technology innovation via accelerating capital renewal and environmental investment. Heterogeneity analysis shows that environmental tax has an inhibitory effect on green technology innovation behavior of large-scale enterprises and eastern region enterprises, while it has a boosting effect on green technology innovation of western region enterprises, and its effect on quantity of innovation is greater than that on quality. This study helps Chinese enterprises to better achieve green development from the perspective of green taxation and provides important empirical basis for achieving the win-win goal of economic growth and environmental development.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

The authors tested the model using managerial data from two countries: USA and India.FindingsThe findings of this study indicated positive direct impacts of service innovation (SI) on FP and positive indirect impacts via SCE in both samples. SI and SCE impacts on FP were both stronger in the US samples. However, the effect of SI on SCE is stronger in India than in the USA. This study also identified moderating impacts of service innovation protection (SIP) on the relationship between SI and FP in the Indian sample and between SI and SCE in the US sample.Originality/valueAlthough there is scholarly research in SI and its impact on FP, there are no studies the authors identified that discuss the moderating effect of SIP. The authors studied the moderating effect of SIP because (1) it is crucial for industries to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, (2) it protects industries investment in research and development and (3) it also protects industries intellectual property, such as trademark, copyrights and patents. There are two key contributions of this study: (a) investigating the effect of SCE between SI and FP and (b) investigating the moderating effect of SIP using managerial data from two countries (USA vs India).",2023,Business & Economics,0
The Possibility to Recreate the Shapes of Objects on the Basis of Printer Vibration in the Additive Printing Process,protection of information; electromagnetic infiltration; vibration infiltrations; 3D printer; data acquisition; recreating the shape of an object; ,"Information protection is an important safety issue in many human activity fields. Technological advances and related ubiquitous computerization bring new challenges in this area. In particular, the problem concerns the protection of devices against non-invasive acquisition processed information in ICT systems. It is known that, e.g., VGA, DVI/HDMI interfaces or laser printer formatter systems that process visual signals are the effective sources of compromising electromagnetic emanations. The emission safety of the more and more commonly used 3D printers is less known. In many cases, the disclosure of information about printed objects might constitute an infringement of the state/industrial/commercial secret, copyright, patent protection, etc. In order to analyze the existing threat, a selected printer using FDM technology was tested. During the tests, simple objects were printed to identify the operation of the stepper motor and the movements of the printer head and the printer platform, which are sources of emissions in the secondary channels. The analyses performed focused on finding the correlation between the recorded vibration signals and the printer head movements when an object was printed. It was shown that the analysis of the registered sensitive signal runtimes and their spectrograms allowed to recreate the printed object shape. Three simple objects (a trihedron, a tube and a tetrahedron) were selected for testing because they include elements that allow the four major movements of the printer head to be easily recognized: along the X axis, along the Y axis, along an arc and diagonally (between the X and Y axes). The paper presents the test results and their analyses.",2021,Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science; Physics,0
RESEARCH ON THE CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SYSTEM BASED ON ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION,Ecological environment; green intellectual property rights; sustainable development; environmental indexes; COORDINATED DEVELOPMENT,"Research on the relationship between climate change, environmental protection and intellectual property rights is an important part of the economic development of green industries. With the rapid development of intellectual property rights represented by biotechnology, industrial technology, and material technology, the massive consumption of non-renewable energy has caused serious damage to the environment on which mankind depends, and these types of intellectual property rights have become an important cause of environmental pollution. Therefore, the construction of a green intellectual property system is very important. In this paper, the analytic hierarchy process is adopted to study in detail the construction of a green intellectual property system based on ecological environment protection. The focus is on four important indicators of the green intellectual property system: environmental index, resource index, social index and intergenerational index. The research results show that green intellectual property rights have a dual effect on the ecological environment. Furthermore, the analytic hierarchy process is used to determine the weight of each indicator of the green intellectual property system. Among them, the environmental indicators have the largest weight at 42%. The secondary indicators evaluated as Grade I include green patent rights, green trademark rights and green copyrights. These indicators are environmentally friendly, which helps to solve environmental problems. The resource index is evaluated as 35% for green intellectual property rights, and its main secondary index is the utilization of renewable resources. The proportions of social indicators and intergenerational indicators are 17% and 6% respectively. The construction of the green intellectual property system based on ecological environment protection in this paper has important reference value for the sustainable development of society.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
The strategic allocation of inventors to R&D collaborations,collaboration; copatents; inventors; R&D; technology leakage; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PARTNER SELECTION; KNOWLEDGE; ALLIANCES; BIOTECHNOLOGY; SCOPE; GOVERNANCE; INNOVATION; INTEGRATION,"Research Summary In this paper, we suggest that staffing decisions in R&D alliances can reduce the inherent tension between value creation and value protection faced by participating firms. By considering R&D workers a primary source of knowledge leakage, we analyze the role of their intellectual property (IP) protection in shaping the misappropriation threat posed by the partner. We rely on patent ownership and inventorship data to analyze the selection of individuals for R&D collaborations in the pharmaceutical industry between 1991 and 2010. Our results suggest that an inventor's strength of IP protection is an important determinant in allocation decisions since it contributes to offsetting leakage risks in the alliance. The effect is especially strong in alliances that anticipate higher hazards. Managerial Summary The literature argues that firms can reap many benefits from R&D collaborations. However, such activities are challenging to manage because they require firms to put valuable knowledge at risk of misappropriation by the partner. We draw attention to the role that inventors play in generating and channeling knowledge during collaborative work and posit that the strength of the IP protection covering their innovations can safeguard against the consequences of knowledge leakage. We analyze pharmaceutical alliances and find that managers are more prone to allocate to collaborations inventors whose knowledge is better protected, particularly when the alliance anticipates considerable misappropriation risks. Our study has implications for how firms allocate inventors across projects, which may be an important factor for the overall success of firms' R&D strategies.",2021,Business & Economics,0

This study examines the high-polluting enterprises that were listed on Chinese A-shares between 2008 and 2021. The influence of environmental information disclosure quality on green innovation is examined using ordinary least squares (OLS) as a benchmark model. The results show that the improvement of environmental information disclosure quality of high-polluting enterprises can significantly improve the quantity and quality of green innovation of enterprises and are mediated by alleviating financing constraints and enhancing cash reserves. Moreover, improving the quality of environmental information disclosure of highly polluting enterprises has a more significant contribution to the quantity and quality of green patents of non-state-owned enterprises, enterprises located in central and eastern China, and large enterprises. The findings of this paper provide theoretical support for achieving a win-win situation of environmental protection and green innovation.",2022,Psychology,0
Negotiating the Intellectual Property Protocol under the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area: Priorities and Opportunities for Nigeria,AfCFTA agreement; IPRs; trade; Nigeria; access to medicines; ,"Early March 2021, following its ratification of the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA agreement), Nigeria's National Office of Trade launched a consultative process into issues constituting the country's priorities as it prepares to participate in the negotiation of the AfCFTA agreement's protocol on intellectual property rights (IPRs). We contributed a position paper to that process, with a focus on key policy considerations that should form Nigeria's negotiation priorities on IPRs. This article describes some of the most important points of our submission and concludes by stressing that the broad policy focus should be to champion initiatives that promote Nigeria's national interest and, at the same time, recognize and accommodate the ideals of inclusiveness, openness, and collaboration within the context of the AfCFTA. In this regard, the paper recommends that Nigeria should prioritize negotiations in recognition of her strongest economic assets in copyright-related sectors and focus on institutional capacity-building for its patent and technology transfer offices so that Nigeria can effectively take advantage of the relevant Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights flexibilities locally. Nigeria can learn from South Africa in domesticating the appropriate legal framework for benefit sharing and the general protection of traditional knowledge and genetic resources. The Swakopmund Protocol on the Protection of Traditional Knowledge and Expressions of Folklore 2010, the Arusha Protocol for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 2015, and the African Union model law for the protection of the rights of local communities, farmers, breeders, and for the regulation of access to biological resources offer relevant guidance.",2022,Government & Law,0

Indicators of four core concepts (R&D, IP protection, collaboration, and external financing) of the innovation process were built using keywords frequency analysis. These web-based indicators were validated using several indicators built from a classic questionnaire-based survey with the following methods: correlation analysis, multitraits multimethods (MTMM) matrices, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results suggest that formative indices built with the questionnaire and web-based indicators measure the same concept, which is not the case when considering the items from the questionnaire separately. Web-based indicators can act either as complements to direct measures or as substitutes for broader measures, notably the importance of R&D and the importance of IP protection, which are normally measured using conventional methods, such as government administrative data or questionnaire-based surveys.",2020,Information Science & Library Science,0

Using China's prefecture-level city data and patent data from 2003 to 2018, this paper takes the implementation of China's 12th Five-year Plan for the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution in Key Regions as a quasi-natural experiment of CEP and adopts Global Malmquist-Luenberger index method to measure China's urban green total factor productivity (GTFP). Then the Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design, DID model, PSM-DID model and Spatial Lag of X model are used to evaluate the impact of CEP on urban GTFP. Furthermore, this study explains the impact mechanism of CEP on urban GTFP from two aspects, the environmental protection effect and the Potter effect. Finally, what kind of cities are more likely to get the policy dividends from CEP is investigated. It shows that, first, CEP helps to improve urban GTFP, which can increase urban GTFP by about 0.05. In addition, the CEP can not only reduce urban energy intensity and carbon emissions, but also promotes urban innovation and industrial structure upgrading. Furthermore, there are obvious local effects and cross-regional conduction phenomena in the above two mechanisms. Third, for the cities with low resource density, perfect infrastructure and strong government intervention, the promoting effect of CEP on urban GTFP is more obvious. The conclusions of this paper not only help to deepen the understandings about the green economy effect of joint pollution prevention and control, but also provides inspiration in forming an effective cross-regional or multinational environmental protection mechanism.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Can digital technology innovation promote total factor energy efficiency? Firm-level evidence from China,Digital technology innovation (DGTI); Total factor energy efficiency (TFE); Operating costs; Internal control quality; Intellectual property protection; Digital industry agglomeration; IMPACT,"The study is based on panel data of listed manufacturing companies from 2010 to 2022, identifies digital technology innovation (DGTI) by using patent data, uses two-step stochastic frontier with Shepard energy distance function to measure total factor energy efficiency (TFE), and analyzes the impact of DGTI on TFE. Research has found that the larger the scale of DGTI, the more conducive it is to TFE. DGTI can also promote TFE by improving environmental responsibility fulfillment and internal control quality, while, DGTI may hinder TFE by increasing operating costs. In the heterogeneity, DGTI has a stronger promoting effect on the TFE of large-scale firms and state-owned firms. In the central and western regions, DGTI has a U-shaped effect that first inhibits and then promotes TFE. Moreover, intellectual property protection, information infrastructure, and digital industry agglomeration will all promote the positive impact of DGTI on TFE.

Experimental evaluation of the shore protection potential of the novel REEFS wave energy converter,Novel multipurpose wave energy converter; Submerged breakwater; Wave energy dissipation; Shore protection; Wave breaking; Wave flume; ,"REEFS is a novel multipurpose patented wave energy converter (WEC) that combines electric energy production with shore protection. The device shows some similarities with natural reefs and detached submerged breakwaters. However, unlike previous ones it is installed with an orthogonal alignment relative to coast line and with a greater freeboard. Exterior stay vanes, are another distinct characteristic of the device. Therefore, the REEFS differentiating functionality of shore protection cannot be directly extrapolated from detached submerged breakwater studies and the effective energy dissipation capacity of this new WEC taking into account its specific characteristics should be investigated. In this article an experimental investigation of the energy dissipation potential of REEFS WEC was implemented. A small scale physical model (1.5:100) was installed in a piston wavemaker flume and tested under regular wave conditions established by applying Fmude similarity to typical West Portuguese sea state conditions. Resistive wave gauges were installed upstream and downstream the device, in order to record water level time series. Discrete Fourier transform technique was used to compute the wave energy spectra (WES). Energy dissipation was evaluated by comparing upstream and downstream WES. Two versions of the device were tested: i) without exterior stay vanes; ii) with exterior stay vanes. Regardless of the version, the REEFS model proved to be able to dissipate part of the incident wave energy. This capacity exhibited a dependence on the wave period, globally decreasing as the wave period increased. The version equipped with stay vanes always exhibited a substantially higher energy dissipation. From a relative point of view, stay vanes showed to be more important for long waves. REEFS energy dissipation was not far from the inferior values reported in literature review for submerged breakwaters of comparable dimensions, confirming the expectations about its shore protection functionality.",2020,Engineering; Oceanography,0
Does improved digital governance in government promote natural resource management? Quasi-natural experiments based on smart city pilots,Digital government; Natural resource management; Green technology innovation; Smart city pilots; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; PATENT EXAMINATION; INNOVATION; TRANSFORMATION; CHINA; PROTECTION; INVENTION; TRENDS; CITIES,"Based on panel data for 281 cities in China from 2007 to 2021, this paper uses the global Malmquist-Luenberger index to measure natural resource management. Using the smart city pilot as a quasi-natural experiment in government digital governance, the progressive difference-in-differences method was used to investigate whether the government's digital governance capacity promotes green and sustainable development. The main findings are as follows: the improvement of the government's digital governance capacity significantly contributes to green and sustainable development. After a series of placebo tests and robustness tests, the results of this paper still hold. Government digital governance promotes natural resource management mainly through two mechanisms: green technology innovation and intellectual property protection, and the quality of green technology innovation plays a more critical role than quantity. The impact of improved government digital governance on natural resource management varies significantly across different types of cities, cities with different political levels, and cities with different urban locations and human capital levels.",2024,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Recent articles and professional reports reflect the importance of public support for private innovations. The issue is actual and relevant both from scientific and practical points of view. Public support for actions aimed at developing crucial innovations is an example of creating institutional incentives for the desired behaviour of firms. The question of public support for innovations is critical for ongoing national and international policies in raising the innovativeness of economies. The main goal of the paper is to review the idea of public support for innovativeness and to verify its effects in European countries empirically, by using simple probit and bivariate probit models. This paper aims to provide a systematic analysis of the problem from an institutional perspective. The results of the analysis contribute to a better understanding of the nature of public spending on private innovations and the outcome of such innovation policies.

Comparative legal analysis of protectability of olfactory trademarks,Exclusive rights; trademark registration; non-traditional means of individualization; olfactory trademark; patent law; ,"In the current growing global commercial turnover of goods and services, there are increasing demands on the ways of their individualization. This applies both to traditional methods of individualization (corporate name, trademark, commercial designation, name of origin, etc.) and non-traditional (olfactory trademarks). The purpose of this study is to study and analyze doctrinal concepts, norms of the current legislation, and law enforcement practice concerning the protection of rights of olfactory trademarks. In order to achieve this objective, the study used a comparative legal method, which analyzed the legal and regulatory framework, as well as the grounds for refusing to register non-traditional trademarks in various legal systems and national jurisdictions. The task of the authors was to conduct a comprehensive study of legislative regulation and practice of legal protection of olfactory trademarks in various jurisdictions. The result of the research is the formulation of a general trend in different jurisdictions toward the legislation on registration of exclusive rights to non-traditional trademarks, which with the help of aromas (smells) allow individualizing the owners of goods produced by them and/or commercial services provided.",2020,Social Sciences - Other Topics,0

However, we observe that while some emerging-economy firms have successfully transitioned from imitation to innovation, others persist in imitation, sometimes resulting in IPR violations. In this paper, we study design innovation in the global tire industry, focusing on South Korean and Chinese firms, and uncover IPR violations by both groups. However, by the 2000s, Korean tire firms had transitioned to developing their own design innovations while Chinese firms persisted in imitation, as evidenced by continuing IP lawsuits. We trace this difference to the fact that South Korea is home to globally successful multinational automobile manufacturers, whereas China is not. These automobile multinationals function as keystone organizations in a national industry ecosystem and are critical to facilitating the transition to innovation. Our study emphasizes the importance of linkages to keystone organizations as crucial elements supporting operations that comply with global IP regulations.",2020,Business & Economics,0
A single dose of genetically-attenuated malaria blood-stage parasites protects against two Plasmodium species infections,Malaria; Plasmodium berghei; Plasmodium yoelii; Blood tage vaccine; Frozen-stock; Mixed immunization; Subcutaneous immunization; ,"Genetically-growth-attenuated blood-stage parasites were generated in Plasmodium falciparum by tar- geted deletion of NT1 (ucleoside Transporter-1) gene, and Pint1(-) parasites only grew after providing the culture with supra-physiological concentrations of purines. Genetically-attenuated P. yoeliitl(-) parasites induced steril-protection against homologous blood-stage infectious challenge after immu- nization with single subpatent doses, which remained subpatent even in immune-compromised mice.

This article summarizes his work on the 50th anniversary of his first publication in this area. He described areas of high heat loss and emphasized the importance of protecting these areas during cold exposure using the Heat Escape Lessening Posture (HELP) and the potential for heat donation to these areas during rewarming. He described several factors that affect the rate of core cooling, including body composition, behavior (swimming increases cooling whereas the HELP position decreases cooling), wet and wind, and thermal protective garments (dry suits offered much more protection than wet suits). Hayward determined breath-hold duration in children as young as 4 y and had his own heart catheterized for 3 d to complete 3 hypothermia rewarming trials. His work provided early understanding of the cold shock response and ways to mitigate its threat to survival. Hay-ward provided valuable contributions to prediction models for heat production, heat loss, and core cooling rates in cold water. He also developed a human model for severe hypothermia and patented the UVic Thermofloat Jacket. Finally, as evidence of his stature in the cold physiology community, Hay-ward was a coauthor of the initial State of Alaska guidelines for the treatment of hypothermia.

How does environmental legislation affect enterprise investment preferences? A quasi-natural experiment based on China's new environmental protection law,Enterprise investment preferences; Environmental legislation; New environmental protection law; RISK-TAKING; CORPORATE,"China's New Environmental Protection Law (NEPL) represents a significant shift from the traditional administration to environmental legalization. Polluting enterprises face more pronounced contradictions between short-term environmental compliance and long-term development. Therefore, based on the CNRDS and CSMAR databases, this paper uses the 2015 NEPL as a quasi-natural experiment to investigate the micro-effects and mechanisms of environmental legislation on firms' investment preferences and environmental performance. The main findings of this paper are as follows. (1) The implementation of the NEPL effectively promotes the key pollutant-discharge enterprises (PDEs) to increase similar financial and environmental investment, and furthermore, the endogenous financing attributes of short-term financial investments can also provide financing for long-term environmental investment. This is due to the reservoir motive and the improvement in the executives' environmental awareness and green attention. (2) The NEPL exhibits heterogeneous policy effects. The key PDEs with political connections are more concerned about environmental management and investment. However, the NEPL's positive impact on environmental investment is weakened in regions with high levels of environmental justice. (3) A shift in the key PDEs' investment structure triggers a series of economic and environmental effects, such as increasing their risk-taking capacity, reducing environmental uncertainty, and significantly improving green patents. This paper provides policy implications for the process of environmental legalization in China and other developing countries.",2024,Business & Economics,0

We theorize that as the ownership of complementary IP rights fragments, the rate at which a focal firm engages in technology acquisitions will increase. Our predictions suggest that firms will expand their IP portfolios through acquisitions as a strategy to continue innovating when the ownership over strategic IP becomes exceedingly spread among technology holders. Furthermore, we propose that this positive relationship between fragmentation and acquisitions will be stronger for firms whose patent portfolios hold relatively less value compared to their peers, owing primarily to their diminished control over strategic IP.

This study explores how economic policy uncertainty affects the decision to disclose innovation-related information. Empirical analyses on a panel of U.S. listed companies show that policy uncertainty increases the likelihood of missing R&D (as opposed to both positive and zero R&D). This result is more pronounced for firms that enjoy a leadership position in their industry, firms in states subject to a weaker legal protection of internal knowledge, and firms that rely more on government demand. During uncertain times, firms also file patents that exhibit a greater textual vagueness.

We also find, however, that the positive effects of disproportionate control on innovation are concentrated in financially constrained firms and firms in highly competitive industries, and that the positive effects dissipate within 10 years after the initial public offering. Most important, the positive effect of dual-class structures for innovation is conditional on the presence of innovative insiders in the firm.

These global multifirm settings have caught attention due to tensions arising from simultaneous collaboration and competition among firms as well as due to the increasing geographical complexity of the standardization process. SSOs present one form of a multifirm environment, where companies proactively and voluntarily collaborate to develop a new standard. Although a growing body of literature has tried to understand firms' underlying rationales for engaging in SSOs, we know little about firm-level characteristics influencing the propensity to enter a standard-setting organization. For this purpose, data of the Community Innovation Survey 2011 for Germany are merged with data of companies' participation at technical committees of the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) between 2010 and 2013. Using these unique data, we can observe the moment when firms enter a technical committee of a formal SSO and, hence, tackle the problem of simultaneity. Our results show that the likelihood to enter a technical committee of an SSO increases for firms that introduce new products or services into the market, while absorptive capacity does not have a significant positive influence. Finally, the protection of innovations by patents further enhances the likelihood to enter a technical committee of an SSO.",2021,Business & Economics; Engineering,0
The power of patent transfer: The impact of green technology acquisition on non-residential CO2 emissions under the intervention of government actions,Green technology acquisition; Cleaner production effect; R&D innovation effect; Government actions; Non-residential CO2 emissions; INNOVATIONS; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; POLICY; TRADE; STATE,"Green technology acquisition solves the mismatch of innovation elements through transactions and realizes the rapid and reasonable allocation of green patents among enterprises with different technology levels. However, whether green technology acquisition can effectively reduce carbon emissions has not yet received the attention it deserves. Based on data of 153 Chinese cities from 2011 to 2019, this paper explores the impact direction and mechanism of green technology acquisition on non-residential CO2 emissions, and analyzes the moderating role of government actions in this process. The study finds that: (1) Green technology acquisition in China has formed a multi-core spatial distribution pattern based on urban agglomerations, among which the Yangtze River Delta, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Pearl River Delta urban agglomerations constitute the main agglomeration areas for green technology acquisition. (2) Green technology acquisition can significantly reduce non-residential CO2 emissions, which is mainly achieved through the cleaner production effect and R&D innovation effect. (3) In terms of government actions, low-carbon advocacy can effectively moderate the mediating role of the cleaner production effect between green technology acquisition and non-residential CO2 emissions, and environmental incentives and environmental penalties can effectively moderate the mediating role of the R&D innovation effect between green technology acquisition and non-residential CO2 emissions, but the moderating paths are different. (4) There is a threshold effect of intellectual property protection in the impact of green technology acquisition on non-residential CO2 emissions. Only when the degree of intellectual property protection exceeds a certain threshold, green technology acquisition can effectively reduce non-residential CO2 emissions. This paper not only explains the key value of green technology for low-carbon development from the perspective of knowledge flow, but also provides a theoretical reference for the rational matching of government actions under the carbon neutrality target.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Compelling Trade Secret Sharing,; COVID-19; LAW; VACCINES; STATUTES,"The unprecedented COVID-19 virus has brought to the forefront many challenges associated with exclusive rights in information, data, and know-how, all of which may constitute protected trade secrets. While patents have received more attention, trade secret information has limited the ability to perform research, develop, test, gain regulatory approval for, manufacture, and distribute globally and at sufficient scale and affordable prices the needed vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, medical devices, and personal protective equipment. Voluntary licensing efforts have proven inadequate to supply pandemic needs. Thus, compelling the sharing or licensing of trade secrets is needed not only to properly address COVID-19, but more importantly to address future pandemics and other serious global problems such as climate change. This Article explains the nature of trade secrets and their protection. It then describes the failures in COVID-19 responses resulting from trade secrets that were not voluntarily licensed. It explains why patent law disclosures have been inadequate to assure competitive global research, development, and production. Given the need for compelled trade secret sharing, this Article surveys the relevant international intellectual property law treaties addressing trade secrets. It demonstrates that, consistent with international law obligations, governments are free to compel trade secret sharing. Further, governments may not be obliged to award compensation for such sharing when regulating to address public health. Given this national freedom to act, this Article then provides numerous examples of existing United States, European, and other authorities that have been or could be used to compel the sharing or licensing of trade secrets. It also notes the potential to adopt more explicit legislation authorizing compelled or induced behaviors. This survey of authorities illustrates that compelling trade secret sharing or licensing should be unobjectionable whenever there is a need to protect lives, health, or the economy. Accordingly, this Article provides a first critical step toward rethinking the nature of international trade secret protections and seeks to develop the political will for governments to protect the global public from the harms that trade secret rights can generate.",2023,Government & Law,0
On-Label or Off-Label? Overcoming Regulatory and Financial Barriers to Bring Repurposed Medicines to Cancer Patients,drug repurposing; drug repositioning; oncology; regulatory framework; policy; off-label use; incentives; ORPHAN DRUGS; CHALLENGES; ONCOLOGY; OPPORTUNITIES; COMPENDIA; TARGETS; NEED,"Repurposing of medicines has gained a lot of interest from the research community in recent years as it could offer safe, timely, and affordable new treatment options for cancer patients with high unmet needs. Increasingly, questions arise on how new uses will be translated into clinical practice, especially in case of marketed medicinal products that are out of basic patent or regulatory protection. The aim of this study was to portray the regulatory framework relevant for making repurposed medicines available to cancer patients in Europe and propose specific policy recommendations to address the current regulatory and financial barriers. We outlined two routes relevant to the clinical adoption of a repurposed medicine. First, a new indication can be approved, and thus brought on-label, via the marketing authorization procedures established in European and national legislation. Such procedures initiate a detailed and independent assessment of the quality and the benefit-risk balance of a medicinal product in a specific indication, benefiting both prescribers and patients as it reassures them that the scientific evidence is robust. However, the process of marketing authorization for new therapeutic indications entails a high administrative burden and significant costs while the return-on-investment for the pharmaceutical industry is expected to be low or absent for medicines that are out of basic patent and regulatory protection. Moreover, most of the repurposing research is conducted by independent or academic researchers who do not have the expertise or resources to get involved in regulatory procedures. A second option is to prescribe a medicine off-label for the new indication, which is managed at the national level in Europe. While off-label use could provide timely access to treatments for patients with urgent medical needs, it also entails important safety, liability and financial risks for patients, physicians, and society at large. In view of that, we recommend finding solutions to facilitate bringing new uses on-label, for example by developing a collaborative framework between not-for-profit and academic organizations, pharmaceutical industry, health technology assessment bodies, payers, and regulators.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

We model a firm's choice concerning: (i) the mix of temporary and permanent workers; (ii) the optimal level of training intensity that firms choose by best-responding to the worker's human capital investments. Results suggest that the innovation-enhancing combination of temporary and permanent workers exists and is unique. Using micro-data on Italian firms, we then find that the relationship between the firm-level share of temporary workers and innovation has indeed an inverted U form, in line with our theoretical expectations. This suggests that studies assuming a linear association may oversimplify the complex relationship between non-standard labor and innovation.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Thermal Protection Technology for Acoustic-Magnetic Device in a Geothermal Water Anti-Scaling System,acoustic-magnetic device; acoustic transmitter; geothermal water; heat transfer; simulation; QuickField; FIELD,"This article presents the results of the design of acoustic-magnetic device thermal protection technology based on simulation. The acoustic-magnetic device (AMD) was installed in the heat supply system of a greenhouse complex with a geothermal heat source, developed and patented by the authors of this paper. Simulation was performed to investigate the possibility of maintaining the acoustic transmitter temperature of the acoustic-magnetic device in its operating range. The QuickField Student Edition v 6.4 simulation environment was used for this purpose. Based on the results of the simulation, the optimum thermal mode of the acoustic-magnetic device was developed and implemented. The optimum temporal operating mode of the acoustic-magnetic device is necessary for the optimization of the non-reagent treatment of geothermal water in a heat supply system of a greenhouse complex. It allows for a considerable reduction in the intensity of scale formation in the heat exchanger and equipment of a geothermal heating system. As demonstrated by the simulation thermal modes, the acoustic-magnetic device provides conditions for the work maintenance of the AMD acoustic transmitter at the resonance frequency, reduces the power expenses, and increases the efficiency of the acoustic influence on the scale formed in the heat supply system of a greenhouse complex. The results of the simulation were implemented in the greenhouse complex of JSC Raduga. The thermal protection technology was realized by installing two acoustic-magnetic devices and automation systems in the geothermal heating system a greenhouse complex.",2021,Energy & Fuels,0
Percutaneous Thrombectomy with a Half-Deployed Stent for the Treatment of Acute Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis,Inferior vena cava; Venous thrombosis; Stents; Embolic protection devices; ,"Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis, a type of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is a relatively rare and poorly known disease compared to lower extremity DVT. We present a case of a 68-year-old woman with abdominal pain and mild lower leg swelling due to IVC thrombosis extending from the common iliac vein to the infrahepatic IVC. The thrombus was removed using a 14-mm Niti-S stent (Taewoong Medical, Korea) inserted via the right internal jugular vein. The stent was partially deployed and gently advanced to cover the thrombus, and then retracted through a vascular sheath capturing the thrombus.

Air pollution control or economic development? Empirical evidence from enterprises with production restrictions,Production restrictions; Air pollution; Economic performance; Industrial enterprise; EMISSIONS; CHINA; IMPACT,"Production restriction is an environmental regulation adopted in China to curb the air pollution of industrial enterprises. Frequent production restrictions may cause economic losses for enterprises and further hinder their green transformation. Polluting enterprises are faced with the dilemma of choosing environmental protection or economic development. Using panel data on industrial enterprises in China from 2016 to 2019, this paper evaluates the impact of production restrictions on both enterprises' environmental and economic performance with regression models. The results show that production restrictions significantly drop the concentrations of SO2 and NOx emitted from polluting enterprises. Meanwhile, production restrictions have significant negative effects on operating income, financial expenses, net profit, and environmental protection investment. The mechanism analysis reveals that production restrictions mitigate air pollutant concentrations by increasing the number of green patents and improving total factor productivity, which also verifies the Porter hypothesis. However, there is a masking mediating effect of environmental investment, which indicates that the reduction of environmental investment hinders the enterprise's efforts to control air pollution. In addition, heterogeneous analysis shows that the economic shock on microenterprises is larger than that on small enterprises. Imple-menting production restrictions for microenterprises may be a way to eliminate their backwards production capacity.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Simultaneous proximal embolic protection and inferior vena cava mechanical thrombectomy using the Flow Triever system,; DEEP-VEIN-THROMBOSIS; MANAGEMENT; DEVICE,"Interventional radiologists have the unique ability to apply their imaging knowledge, wide scope of technical skills, and use of innovative technologies to comprehensively address the percutaneous management of the thromboembolic disease processes. This report illustrates successful management of a thrombosed inferior vena cava (IVC), while protecting against possible pulmonary embolism. Here, we present a 49-year-old female with stage IIIB ovarian cancer who presented with severe bilateral lower extremity edema and anasarca in the setting of occlusive thrombus of IVC. The thrombus was the result of compression from a large hepatic hematoma which gradually developed after radical hysterectomy. A new mechanical thrombectomy device approved for use in pulmonary embolism, Inari FlowTriever catheter, was used off-label to remove the clot. The self-expanding mesh discs in the Inari FlowTriever catheter were utilized to protect against pulmonary embolism while percutaneously draining the hepatic hematoma and alleviating the IVC compression. The IVC was largely patent at the end of the procedure, and the patient experienced complete resolution of her symptoms. This case report demonstrates the successful and safe off-label use of a new mechanical thrombectomy device approved for pulmonary embolism thrombectomy in the IVC and illustrates a novel application of the nitinol mesh discs in the device as proximal embolic protection.",2020,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",0
Relationship between economic liberalization and intellectual property protection with regional innovation in China. A case study of Chinese provinces,; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; COMPETITION; RIGHTS; POLICY; MODEL,"International openness can affect regional innovation through more export opportunities, enhanced import competition and the spillover effects of foreign direct investment. Many studies have been conducted based on different countries for capturing the determinants of regional innovation, but very little literature is available with contradictory findings for the case of China. Based on 19 years' panel data of 31 Chinese provinces, this paper analyzes the impact of international openness on regional innovation measured by the number of patent grants. The positive effects of overall trade and a higher proportion of exports and imports to GDP are significant and robust across different model specifications, indicating that an increase in international openness can promote regional innovating activities in China. The causal relationship of all the variables depicted by path analysis matches the results of the system GMM model. Higher intellectual property protection provides each region with the opportunity to obtain economic benefits from innovation and then make a higher investment in R&D activities. Besides, the lag effect of regional innovation capability can also explain a large part of local innovating activities. In our subsample regressions, the positive effect of trade openness on innovation is majorly manifested in developed areas like eastern provinces.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
Can local environmental constraints improve enterprise's green innovation quality?

Comprehensively investigating how local environmental target constraints drive enterprises to improve their green innovation quality is of enormous theoretical and practical significance for optimizing the implementation effect of environmental target constraints policies and boosting enterprises' green and high-quality development. We empirically examine the mechanism of the impact of the intensity of different types of local environmental target constraints on the quality of corporate green innovation and the nonlinear relationship between them through innovatively constructing indicators of local environmental target constraint intensity and utilizing the knowledge width of green patents of listed companies as a proxy variable for enterprise green innovation quality. First, the strength of indirect environmental target constraints has a significant positive effect on the quality of green innovation, but further nonlinear characteristics reveal a significant inverse U-shaped relationship between them. Second, indirect environmental target constraint intensity has an inverted U-shaped trend in increasing the intensity of environmental regulation and influencing the digitalization of enterprises, which in turn forms an inverted U-shaped relationship with the quality of green innovation. Third, indirect environmental target constraint intensity works better in areas with policies prioritizing city over province, with mayors less than 57 years old, and for enterprises in technology-intensive industries.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
The potential role of patent and proprietary medicine vendors' associations in improving the quality of services in Nigeria's drug shops,Association; iCCM; NAPPMED; Regulatory agencies; Patent and proprietary medicine vendors; HEALTH; PROVIDERS,"BackgroundPatent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) play a major role in Nigeria's health care delivery but regulation and monitoring of their practice needs appreciable improvement to ensure they deliver quality services. Most PPMVs belong to associations which may be useful in improving their regulation. However, little is known about how the PPMV associations function and how they can partner with relevant regulatory agencies to ensure members' compliance and observance of good practice. This study sought to describe the PPMV associations' structure and operations and the regulatory environment in which PPMVs function. With this information we explore ways in which the associations could help improve the coverage of Nigeria's population with basic quality health care services.MethodsA mixed methods study was conducted across four rural local government areas (LGAs) (districts) in two Nigerian states of Bayelsa and Oyo. The study comprises a quantitative data collection of 160 randomly selected PPMVs and their shops, eight PPMV focus group discussions, in-depth interviews with 26 PPMV association executives and eight regulatory agency representatives overseeing PPMVs' practice.ResultsThe majority of the PPMVs in the four LGAs belonged to the local chapters of National Association of Patent and Proprietary Medicine Dealers (NAPPMED). The associations were led by executive members and had regular monthly meetings. NAPPMED monitored members' activities, provided professional and social support, and offered protection from regulatory agencies. More than 80% of PPMVs received at least one monitoring visit in the previous 6 months and local NAPPMED was the organization that monitored PPMVs the most, having visited 68.8% of respondents. The three major regulators, who reached 30.0-36.3% of PPMVs reported lack of human and financial resources as the main challenge they faced in regulation.ConclusionsQuality services at drug shops would benefit from stronger monitoring and regulation. The PPMV associations already play a role in monitoring their members. Regulatory agencies and other organizations could partner with the PPMV associations to strengthen the regulatory environment and expand access to basic quality health services at PPMV shops in Nigeria.",2020,Health Care Sciences & Services,0
Air pollution and corporate innovation: incentive or resistance? Evidence from regression discontinuity,Air pollution; Corporate innovation; Regression discontinuity; Green innovation; Huai River policy; PRODUCTIVITY EVIDENCE; NATURAL EXPERIMENT; LIFE EXPECTANCY; CHINA; US,"The potentially serious economic consequences of China's severe air pollution problem cannot be overlooked, especially the impact on corporate innovation, which is a core driver guiding firms towards efficient and high-quality development. However, the existing literature has more often investigated the effect of pollution on corporate innovation from the perspective of environmental regulation, while relatively little research is available directly from the perspective of air pollution. In this study, for better causal identification and endogeneity treatment, we consider the Qin ling Mountains-Huai River heating policy as a quasi-natural experiment and explore for the first time the causal effect of air pollution on Chinese industrial firms' innovation through a geographical regression discontinuity (RD) approach. The results find that air pollution has a significant inhibitory effect on the industrial firms' innovation, especially for green innovation, where the innovation of state-owned enterprises, high pollution, and low monopoly firms are more sensitive to pollution. Specifically, a 1% increase in PM2.5 emissions leads to a 0.803% reduction in the corporate total innovation, a 0.924% reduction in invention patents, a 0.574% reduction in utility model patents, and a 1.087% reduction in design patents. We have verified the robustness of this core finding through a series of robustness checks including adjustment bandwidth, IV estimation, and placebo test. Further to this, we find that air pollution may negatively affect corporate innovation through three channels: crowding out R&D investment, reducing total factor productivity (TFP), and reducing labor supply and the proportion of highly skilled employees. This study sheds light on the severe losses caused by air pollution on corporate innovation capabilities at the micro-level, deepening the understanding of the economic harm caused by air pollution. This suggests that as firms strive to improve their innovative capacity and competitiveness, they should also be aware of environmental protection and green development; otherwise, unnecessary losses in innovation dynamics will be incurred.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Dealing with AI-generated works: lessons from the CDPA section 9(3),; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; AUTHORSHIP,"This article aims to provide some input for revising the text of section 9(3) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA), without proposing a new provision. Specifically, it addresses the question of how this provision should be construed vis-a-vis Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated outputs. Although numerous options have been discussed in literature, so far none of them has comprehensively looked at the broader context in which users of generative AI models give instructions and how these prompts could impact issues of subsistence in AI-generated outputs. This article aims to fill that gap.Before suggesting a new framework for reconsidering the provision of section 9(3) CDPA, this contribution briefly revisits the originality, fixation and human authorship requirements, and explains how these are met when AI is involved in creative processes. Next, it questions whether the copyright regime is the appropriate form of protection for AI-generated outputs. Lastly, it provides an examination of the strengths and weaknesses of section 9(3).This article supports the human-centred approach of the CDPA towards authorship of AI-generated works. However, it also suggests that a more nuanced approach should be adopted. Specifically, it contends that under section 9(3), AI-generated works should belong to the user of the AI model giving instructions only as long as such directions to create are sufficiently original themselves for the purposes of copyright protection. Furthermore, de lege ferenda, this distinction should be expressly included in the text of section 9(3).",2024,Government & Law,0

In this setting the exit and export cutoff productivities differ from those in the standard environment, leading to a different sorting mechanism. The model also predicts that the highest-productivity firms will implement new technologies and innovate more after stronger enforcement.

Corporate tax cuts in a Schumpeterian growth model with an endogenous market structure,; LONG-RUN; PATENT PROTECTION; FREE ENTRY; POLICY; TAXATION; INCOME,"Schumpeterian theory simply predicts a negative relationship between corporate income tax and the economic growth rate because this tax decreases innovation rewards. However, empirical evidence for the effect of corporate tax on the growth rate is mixed. To fill this gap, this paper presents a Schumpeterian growth model with an endogenous market structure that generates an ambiguous relationship between the corporate tax rate and the growth rate. We analytically find that the relationship between the corporate tax rate and the growth rate can be either inverted U-shaped or negative. In our endogenous market structure model, corporate tax cuts make the market more competitive and increase the costs of employing researchers through labor market equilibrium. Consequently, these two effects may dominate the Schumpeterian effect. In this case, a corporate tax cut may decrease economic growth.",2022,Business & Economics,0

The left inter-nal thoracic artery (LITA) graft anastomosed to the left descending artery was not affected by the aortic dissection, and during the ascending aortic replacement, the artery was not identified for clamping. Although fully sufficient cardioplegia was not achieved due to the patent LITA graft, the patient's postoperative cardiac function was good. The two anastomotic sites of the vein grafts to the ascending aorta were excised along with a remnant of the aortic wall in an island fashion and were reimplanted onto the artificial graft.

Health Care and the Limits of Progressive Neoliberalism: Re-Evaluating the Trade-Health Interface 2006-2019,trade policy; health policy; progressive neoliberalism; investment law; drug policy; ,"From 1995 to 2006, Canadian trade policy purported to insulate the Canadian health care system from the effects of trade liberalization, largely through reliance upon key general exclusion clauses in the NAFTA and the GATS and other legal strategies. During the Conservative years 2006-2015 the government de-emphasized these strategies, and (more importantly) the international trade agenda increasingly emphasized investment promotion and patent protection. When the Liberal Party returned to government in 2015, personal, structural, and ideological factors all pointed to the retention of the neoliberal trade agenda, but one which was legitimated by more 'progressive' features, such as side-agreements.

Increased Aortic Exclusion in Endovascular Treatment of Complex Aortic Aneurysms,complex aortic aneurysm; endovascular repair; open repair; aortic exclusion; Crawford classification; SPINAL-CORD PROTECTION; EDITORS CHOICE; THORACOABDOMINAL ANEURYSM; REPORTING STANDARDS; OPEN REPAIR; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; ENDOGRAFTS; ISCHEMIA; COVERAGE,"Purpose: Perioperative risk assessments for complex aneurysms are based on the anatomical extent of the aneurysm and do not take the length of the aortic exclusion into account, as it was developed for open repair. Nevertheless, in the endovascular repair (ER) of complex aortic aneurysms, additional segments of healthy aorta are excluded compared with open repair (OR). The aim of this study was to assess differences in aortic exclusion between the ER and OR of complex aortic aneurysms, to subsequently assess the current classification for complex aneurysm repair. Methods: This retrospective observational study included patients that underwent complex endovascular aortic aneurysm repair by means of fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR), fenestrated and branched EVAR (FBEVAR), or branched EVAR (BEVAR). The length of aortic exclusion and the number of patent segmental arteries were determined and compared per case in ER and hypothetical OR, using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: A total of 71 patients were included, who were treated with FEVAR (n = 44), FBEVAR (n = 8), or BEVAR (n = 19) for Crawford types I (n = 5), II (n = 7), III (n = 6), IV (n = 7), and V (n = 2) thoracoabdominal or juxtarenal (n = 44) aneurysms. There was a significant increase in the median exclusion of types I, II, III, IV, and juxtarenal aneurysms (p < 0.05) in ER, compared with hypothetical OR. The number of patent segmental arteries in the ER of type I-IV and juxtarenal aneurysms was significantly lower than in hypothetical OR (p < 0.05). Conclusion: There are significant differences in the length of aortic exclusion between ER and hypothetical OR, with the increased exclusion in ER resulting in a lower number of patent segmental arteries. The ER and OR of complex aortic aneurysms should be regarded as distinct modalities, and as each approach deserves a particular risk assessment, future efforts should focus on reporting on the extent of exclusion per treatment modality, to allow for appropriate comparison.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,0
Grafting Traditional Knowledge onto a Common Law System,; GENETIC-RESOURCES; PROPERTY; AUSTRALIA; BIOPIRACY; HERITAGE; CULTURE; PLANTS,"Modern legal systems are not usually designed to protect Indigenous traditional knowledge or traditional cultural expressions but are, more often, historically complicit in their misuse or suppression. The undefined status of traditional knowledge has left Indigenous communities vulnerable to harms not readily cognizable by either common or civil law systems: exploitation of those communities' genetic resources and medical knowledge, demeaning of their sacred symbols, and further alienation from their culture and land following colonial dispossession. Indigenous groups have therefore sought greater protection of traditional knowledge through a range of domestic and international legal avenues. This Article examines the experience of Australia as the common law jurisdiction that has likely gone furthest in protecting traditional knowledge. Aboriginal Australian claimants have found varying degrees of success through mechanisms such as copyright law, patent law, consumer protection, fiduciary claims, and privacy rights. Even at their most successful, however, these claimants have not obtained recognition of the unique interests represented by traditional knowledge. Instead, they have been forced to translate their claims into terms close to the conventional utilitarian or personality-based justifications for intellectual property.

After decades of disagreements, an international instrument in this area is expected to be agreed during a World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Diplomatic Conference to be held in 2024. The basis for the final steps in the negotiation is the Chair's Draft prepared by the Secretariat of the WIPO Intergovernmental Committee. The question is, however, whether this Draft has the potential to achieve the desired goals. This article undertakes a critical analysis of the Draft to assess its adequacy for an effective protection of GRs and its suitability for strategic policies on ABS. We also explore alternative regulatory options for specific issues.",2024,Government & Law,0
R&D subsidies in permissive and restrictive environment: Evidence from Korea,R&D subsidy; Regulatory environment; WTO subsidy rules; Innovations; Patent; Utility model; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; DEVELOPMENT POLICY; PROTECTION; LAWS; GOVERNMENT; TRADE; LESSONS; SYSTEM; IMPACT,"This paper investigates the extent to which a regulatory environment for R&D subsidies shapes the magnitude and direction of R&D subsidies set by a government and consequent innovation paths. When the WTO adopted a permissive regulatory environment, we find that the Korean government increased R&D subsidies significantly (89.21%) and selectively so for firms and industries with higher returns. Recipient firms conducted less basic research and more development research. Improvements in innovations were mostly incremental and minor. However, such changes did not persist once the WTO switched to a restrictive regulatory environment. Our findings show that the regulatory environment imposed by the WTO largely affects allocation of R&D subsidies and suggest that a permissive regulatory environment may not necessarily maximize the potential for breakthrough innovations.",2023,Business & Economics,0

Within the last two decades the technology gap between European regions has increased considerably. Building on previous studies that have used data envelopment analysis (DEA) and which have neglected national production structures and pre-existing technological heterogeneity, we examine differences in regional productive performance by using a meta-frontier framework. Our findings confirm significant differences in productive performance across European regions and a large North-South technology gap. A panel vector autoregression (PVAR) shows that this regional technology gap can be attributed to differences in human capital and innovation activity.",2022,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration,0
Comparing Onset of Biosimilar Versus Generic Competition in the United States,; MARKET EXCLUSIVITY; PRESCRIPTION DRUGS; ORIGINS; ENTRY; ACT,"We sought to compare expected and observed biosimilar and generic entry dates among new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2000 and 2012. We defined expected biosimilar and generic entry dates as the later of the expiration of the key patent term or statutory exclusivity (12 years for biologics, 5 years for small molecule drugs not indicated for a rare disease, and 7 years for small molecule drugs indicated for a rare disease; plus 6 months if a pediatric extension had been granted). For drugs with expected entry prior to 2019, we calculated the proportion with observed biosimilar or generic entry. The expected biosimilar entry dates were estimated to be a median of 12.3 years (interquartile range (IQR) 12.0-14.0,n = 60) after FDA approval. The 12-year biologic statutory exclusivity period comprised 98% of the median expected protection period. By contrast, expected generic entry was estimated to be a median of 12.2 years (IQR 8.4-14.0,n=268), or 7.2 years after the 5-year small molecule statutory exclusivity (59% of the total expected market protection period). By 2019, observed biosimilar entry occurred in 12% of cases (3/25) and observed generic entry in 65% (101/155). We concluded that expected US market exclusivity periods are similar for biologic and small molecule drugs. Statutory exclusivity plays a more substantial role in market exclusivity protection for biologics. Biosimilar competition, currently lagging behind generic competition, will likely increase as the biosimilar market becomes established.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
Intangible Capital and Modern Economies,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; BRAND CHOICE; PRODUCTIVITY; INVESTMENT; PRICE; TECHNOLOGY; ASSETS,"Every practitioner of economics, whether student or professional, will at some point be asked about growth, innovation, and economic performance. Why are many African countries so poor? How did Japanese car companies come to dominate world production? How did some firms like Walmart, Amazon, and Facebook get to be so big, while others like Sears, Webvan, and MySpace crashed and burned? At this point, the practitioner will recall the textbook account of a production function, in which output is a function of inputs of capital, labor, and technology. To make the abstractions concrete, most textbooks are peppered with examples from agriculture or manufacturing.

Operating risk of enterprises when adopting environmental regulation: Evidence from environmental protection law in China,Operating risk; Environmental regulation; Innovation incentive; Environmental management; GREEN INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE; POLLUTION REGULATION; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; POLICY; FIRMS; MIX,"Addressing the negative externality of pollutant emissions requires environmental regulations. The well -designed environmental regulation can stimulate innovation and reinforce management, which may lead to operating risk decreases in heavily polluting firms. This study evaluates the effect of environmental regulations using the enactment of the Chinese New Environmental Protection Law (NEPL) in 2015 as an exogenous shock. Our difference -in -differences estimation shows that the deterrent of the NEPL reduces the operating risk of heavily polluting firms, and the relationships are robust to different specifications and alternative settings. We also find that the impact of the NEPL is more pronounced in subsamples with higher ex -ante innovation and improved environmental management. Further evidence shows that innovative firms may be better positioned to develop green technologies by patenting to comply with environmental regulations. Moreover, the improved environmental management practices under regulations may attract more analyst attention which help firms build a positive reputation in the market. Such responses to comply with environmental regulations ultimately reduce the operating risk of firms. Overall, our study sheds light on the micro mechanisms behind the NEPL's effect on firms' operating risk, providing implications and references for policymakers and firm managers.",2024,Business & Economics,0

This paper examines the impact of IPR on import-sourcing decisions of multinational firms. We consider a framework in which firms offshore production of an intermediate good to another country. Firms can decide either to import the intermediate good from vertically integrated producers, or from independent suppliers. In both cases, offshoring part of the production process embodies a risk of imitation. The model predicts that, under reasonable parameter restrictions, stronger IPR disproportionately encourages the imports of intermediate goods through vertical integration. Using the US Related-Party Trade database, we find empirical evidence supportive of the positive link between level of IPR and the share of imports from vertically integrated manufacturers. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Systemic technology innovation management and analysis of other forms of IP protection,Technological preparation of production; Technological innovations; Pandemic; Problem companies; Trademarks; Industrial designs; Utility models; PRODUCT DESIGN; REFLECTIONS; TRADEMARK; COUNTRIES; ASIA,"Industry 4.0 and the pandemic have caused recent changes in innovative development, economic situations, and restrictions in various companies and regions of the world, with new stricter legislation related to working conditions, hygiene standards, and health requirements. New technologies are a challenge to the transformation of problem companies and regions, as they often significantly impact economic development. Technological emissions, growing information on dementia among young people, cyber risks, and the risks of so-called advanced technologies (e.g., bio- and nanotechnologies, Industry 4.0 tech) may raise societal concerns about technological progress. This study is part of our long-term research into technological innovation in different companies and regions. Its primary goal is to methodically emphasize the importance and role of the systemic management of technological innovation in companies and regions and analytically compare the innovation success of differently developed regions from a global perspective1. This research deals with an important aspect of technology management, namely, the processes of technological identification and the protection of related intellectual property (IP). The primary research question is: How has technological development been distributed across different regions over the last two decades? We hypothesize that Asian countries are increasingly moving away from Europe and North America in terms of technological innovation, other forms of technological IP protection, and overall access to innovation, while the focus is on the development of three non-patent forms of technological innovation protection: industrial designs, trademarks, and utility models. The results of our study reveal a significant difference in the approach to technological innovation management and the form of IP protection between so-called advanced and problem companies and regions.

Chemoprophylaxis Vaccination: Phase I Study to Explore Stage-specific Immunity to Plasmodium falciparum in US Adults,chemoprophylaxis vaccination with sporozoites; malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; primaquine; chloroquine; HUMAN MALARIA; HUMAN VOLUNTEERS; PROTECTION; IMMUNIZATION; CHALLENGE; BLOOD; CHLOROQUINE; PRIMAQUINE; MOSQUITOS; HUMANS,"Background Chemoprophylaxis vaccination with sporozoites (CVac) with chloroquine induces protection against a homologous Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) challenge, but whether blood-stage parasite exposure is required for protection remains unclear. Chloroquine suppresses and clears blood-stage parasitemia, while other antimalarial drugs, such as primaquine, act against liver-stage parasites. Here, we evaluated CVac regimens using primaquine and/or chloroquine as the partner drug to discern whether blood-stage parasite exposure impacts protection against homologous controlled human malaria infection. Methods In a Phase I, randomized, partial double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 36 malaria-naive adults, all CVac subjects received chloroquine prophylaxis and bites from 12-15 P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes (CVac-chloroquine arm) at 3 monthly iterations, and some received postexposure primaquine (CVac-primaquine/chloroquine arm). Drug control subjects received primaquine, chloroquine, and uninfected mosquito bites. After a chloroquine washout, subjects, including treatment-naive infectivity controls, underwent homologous, PfSPZ controlled human malaria infection and were monitored for parasitemia for 21 days. Results No serious adverse events occurred. During CVac, all but 1 subject in the study remained blood-smear negative, while only 1 subject (primaquine/chloroquine arm) remained polymerase chain reaction-negative. Upon challenge, compared to infectivity controls, 3/3 chloroquine arm subjects displayed delayed patent parasitemia (P = .01) but not sterile protection, while 3/11 primaquine/chloroquine subjects remained blood-smear negative. Conclusions CVac-primaquine/chloroquine is safe and induces sterile immunity to P. falciparum in some recipients, but a single 45 mg dose of primaquine postexposure does not completely prevent blood-stage parasitemia. Unlike previous studies, CVac-chloroquine did not produce sterile immunity. Clinical Trials Registration NCT01500980. Chemoprophylaxis vaccination with sporozoites (CVac) with chloroquine and primaquine is safe and induces sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum in some recipients, but does not completely prevent blood-stage parasitemia.

The effect of environmental centralisation on productivity: Evidence from an administrative reform in China,China; environmental centralisation; environmental decentralisation; green patent; total factor productivity; POLLUTING FIRMS; GROWTH; DECENTRALIZATION; FEDERALISM; SPILLOVERS; QUALITY; POLICY; COSTS; REGULATIONS; ENFORCEMENT,"This paper adopts a novel institutional perspective-environmental centralisation-to examine its impact on firm productivity in developing countries. In 2008, China's State Environmental Protection Administration was upgraded to the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP). This administrative reform strengthened the central government's ability to protect the environment, enabling it to address more environmental affairs and concentrate on environmental rights. Based on the quasi-natural experiment of the establishment of the MEP, this study takes a new perspective on the impact of environmental centralisation on productivity. The difference-in-difference-in-difference approach is used for the first time to estimate the impact of environmental centralisation on productivity. We find that environmental centralisation caused by the establishment of the MEP significantly increased the productivity of heavily polluting companies, and a series of robustness tests confirm that the results are credible. We identify three possible mechanisms, namely, facilitating innovation, curbing rent-seeking behaviour and inhibiting over-investments. The policy implication of this study is that the effectiveness of environmental policy depends not only on the policy itself but also on the allocation of environmental rights among different levels of government.",2024,Development Studies,0

This paper focuses on sustainable business model (SBM) innovations as a way to systemically transform businesses towards sustainability. It has been widely recognized that strategic approaches to using intellectual property (IP) need to be aligned with business model innovation for commercial success. Here we suggest that IP, aligned with SBMs, can also be used to create not only commercial, but also societal and environmental impact. Knowledge about how to best align IP with SBMs to drive sustainability transitions remains limited. We address this gap by developing an SBM-IP canvas that integrates IP considerations into each of the SBM canvas building blocks. We do this by employing relevant theoretical concepts from three literature streams, namely the business model (including SBM), IP, and innovation literature. We use case examples to illustrate different IP considerations that are relevant for the SBM-IP building blocks. These examples show that different IP types (e.g., patents, trademarks) and ways of using them (e.g., more or less restrictive licensing) are applied by companies in relation to the different building blocks. While covering new theoretical ground, the proposed SBM-IP canvas can help decision makers understand how they can use different IP types strategically to propose, create, deliver, and capture sustainable value for society, environment, and the business.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Efforts are been made to prevent hailstorms, which can be quite severe. However, a completely successful result has not been achieved. Automobiles are the ones most damaged by hailstorms. In order to protect automobiles from this damage, various protective fabrics have been studied on and patents have been obtained. Spacer fabrics are one of the materials that have the potential to be used as protectors. In this study, an experimental device that can test the performance of spacer fabrics against hail and simulate hail damage has been designed and manufactured. At the same time, suggestions for the preparation of artificial hail grains that can be used in different studies are presented. With 25 mm and 30 mm diameter artificial hail grains, experiments were carried out on spacer fabrics of different thicknesses with the same weave structure. The same diameters of artificial hail grains were also tested without covering and the amount of damage in all experiments was measured. As a result, it was compared which fabric provided how much protection against artificial hailstones of different diameters. Automobiles are the ones most damaged by hailstorms. In order to protect automobiles from this damage, various protective fabrics have been studied on and patents have been obtained. In this study, an experimental device that can test the performance of spacer fabrics against hail and simulate hail damage has been designed and manufactured. image",2024,Materials Science,0
What's Your Stake When Engaging in Licensing?

Whether these alternative schemes are more frequently associated with particular types of licensors and licensees and whether they imply different outcomes for the two parties is still underinvestigated in the relevant literature. Inspired by this, our exploratory study, enriched by 341 observations of licensing contracts signed between 1990 and 2010, addresses these research gaps. Aiming at this, this article offers a full-fledged analysis, encompassing an in-depth overview of the overall licensing deals, a detailed description of the licensing parties' profiles, and a t-test comparison of licensing parties' traits both at the time of the licensing deal and after the deal, in the two different regimes. Further, it presents a complementary econometric exercise for assessing the impact of the two alternatives for both the licensor and the licensee. The study shows that, in general, licensors are more inventive and less specialized than licensees, and that licensors and licensees engaging in standard licensing have a higher knowledge overlap than firms engaging in partnership embedded licensing. The difference is also remarkable in terms of the outcomes of the different license agreements measured through patenting activity: the licensor is more likely to guide the invention process in standard licensing contexts, while the licensee is more likely to guide it in the opposite scenario.",2023,Business & Economics; Engineering,0
Policies for carbon-zero targets: Examining the spillover effects of renewable energy and patent applications on environmental quality in Europe,Renewable energy; Energy price; CO 2 emissions; Patent application; Spatial econometric model; Europe; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CO2 EMISSIONS; SPATIAL ECONOMETRICS; CONSUMPTION; NEXUS; MODELS,"This study examined the spillover effects of CO2 and the marginal effects of trade and renewable energy in 29 countries in Europe using the spatial panel econometric models namely; the spatial error model, spatial lag model, and spatial Durbin model. The study further applied the pooled OLS, random, and fixed effects from the non-spatial models for comparative analysis. The Wald and likelihood tests showed that the dynamic spatial Durbin approach was the best model for the study. Furthermore, the fixed-effects model was selected as the most appropriate model for explaining the elasticities of the exploratory variables by the Hausman test. The results suggest that growing growing renewable energy in a country results in a decrease of carbon emissions in that country and neighboring countries, respectively. Additionally, the findings support the claim that CO2 emissions from one particular area spread to the next nation and the far-off trading partner. According to the findings, to achieve sustainable growth, regulatory agencies must take steps to reduce CO2 emissions from both within the target country and from other neighboring countries, suggesting that cooperation is the best option for mitigating environmental issues efficiently. Considering all the evidence, it is reasonable for national economies to cooperate for environmental protection purposes with their neighbors and create a commmon regulatory framework for efficient mitigation of carbon emissions.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Gravity for cross-border licensing and the impact of deep trade agreements: Theory and evidence,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; MULTINATIONAL FIRMS; PATENT PROTECTION; DIRECT-INVESTMENT; EXPORTS; INNOVATION; EQUATIONS; LEVEL,"We examine whether deep regional trade agreements facilitate cross-border licensing. A micro-founded gravity equation for each supply mode is derived from a model in which heterogeneous firms choose to supply their goods to foreign markets through export, foreign direct investment or licensing. We present several comparative statics results regarding the effects of changes in the fixed costs of serving the destination country, the freeness of trade, and the strength of intellectual property rights protection on bilateral flows of licensing revenues. We then empirically test our theoretical predictions using data on the cross-border flows of royalties and licence fees for 49 countries in the period 1995-2012. In addition to variables that capture the impact of shallow and deep regional trade agreements, we construct dummy variables that represent subcategories of IP rights-related provisions. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we find that improved access to the destination market through a deep regional trade agreement and stronger IP rights protection through a regional trade agreement with legally enforceable IP rights and technology-related provisions increase bilateral flows of licensing revenues. Among IP rights-related provisions, the accession to or ratification of existing international IP agreements and the protection of trademarks, patents, or industrial designs are important for facilitating cross-border licensing.

The EB2020 experimental house was largely designed in accordance with the patented ISOMAX system (SK 284 751, author: Dipl.-Ing., Phys. Edmond D. KRECK & Eacute;), which represents a high potential for the use of renewable energy sources. When designing the experimental house EB2020, we eliminated the problem of this system by designing top heat sources, whose heat sources are exclusively solar and geothermic energy. The investigated building is designed with the following heat sources and energy systems: energy roof, low-temperature gas boiler, fireplace with hot water exchanger, ground heat storage, storage water heat storage with electric reheat-ing, active thermal protection, large-area radiant low-temperature heating / high-temperature cooling, liquid cooling circuit in the ground outside the building, recuperative air handling unit and air ground heat exchanger. In this paper we describe the theoretical procedure for calculating the efficiency of the energy roof, comparison with a classic solar collector, experimental measurements of the energy roof during one season and evaluation of the measured data. The application of an energy roof requires lower investment costs than conventional solar collectors, but experimental measurements have shown that the energy gain and the achieved temperatures of the working substance at the outlet are significantly lower. For higher efficiency energy roof, it is worth considering installing a dark roofing and installing more circuits with a suitable orientation according to cardinal directions.

"Critical analysis of the protection of Traditional Knowledge Bill, 2022",India; positive protection; traditional cultural expressions; traditional knowledge; ,"The need for protecting traditional knowledge (TK) has been long established, and as a result, international negotiations are being conducted to protect TK internationally. Many international authorities appreciate India's efforts to create unique ways to protect TK. For instance, India was the first nation to set up Traditional Knowledge Digital Library, which helps scrutinise Patent applications on TK. Recently, Dr Shashi Tharror MP brought a private bill titled 'Protection of TK'. Even though it's a bill, it still needs to be analysed because it serves as a reference point while formulating legislation by the union government or any state government. Hence, the paper aims to critically analyse the bill to point out its shortcomings of the bill. The bill gives TK holders hope since it asserts that it will protect TK from misappropriation. This bill can aid in commercialising TK. However, it is doubtful that the TK holders would gain from such commercialisation as specific provisions in the bill tend to favour outsiders more than the tribal or indigenous communities. It is identified that many crucial concepts about TK, such as 'dynamic or changing' or 'traditional context', which are necessary for stakeholders, authorities, and the judiciary to properly appreciate the nature of TK, have gone undefined. Also, it begs the question of why such a significant, essential component of TK is missing when the word 'community' is excluded from the definition of the term knowledge society. In essence, it is possible to argue that the bill has been inadequately written without enough weight on the philosophy of TK and its jurisprudential comprehension.",2023,Government & Law,0

The goal of this study is to identify and systematize risks that occur in the intellectual property rights market. These risks are the integral part of the risk management system and they ensure effective intellectual property management that allows preventing possible financial losses of economic entities. The practice of using exclusive rights in economic activity justify the relevance of the research. The methodological base for this study is formed with general research methods such as analysis, systematization and classification. Judicial practice discussed in the article discloses practical aspects of intellectual property risks and emphasizes the significance of risk management system for an enterprise. Cases from judicial practice allow the authors to conduct deeper research into risks confronting different subjects of the intellectual property market and to identify the weaknesses of the risk management system. Analysis of the factors that cause risk emergence in the intellectual property market reveals the lack of systematic approach towards risk management, insufficient control and level of competence in the issues of protection of the intellectual property rights.

Second, the article raises the challenges of transposing farmers' rights to seed practices into national legislation to make these rights effective and enforceable. Indeed, when transposing these rights, World Trade Organization (WTO) member states must act within the scope of Article 27:3(b) of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which establishes international obligations for the protection of plant varieties through intellectual property rights. Finally, this paper argues that the adoption of sui generis plant variety protection legislation, as enshrined in both Article 27.3(b) of the TRIPS Agreement and Article 9 of the ITPGRFA, is a means of ensuring the coexistence at the national level of the international regime of farmers' rights and the international regime of intellectual property rights on plant varieties, as well as a solution to recognize the plurality of plant variety breeding methods and practices.",2022,Government & Law,0
The Importance of Emerging Technologies to the Increasing of Corporate Sustainability in Shipping Companies,corporate sustainability; shipping; technology; environmental protection; CSR; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MEDIATING ROLE; CSR; INNOVATION; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; LOYALTY; IMAGE,"Corporate sustainability is understood as the integration of economic, environmental, and social considerations into the company's mission. In the shipping market, it allows for a wide spectrum of integration of corporate management areas: shipowners' financial condition, environmental protection, work safety, seafarers' health, and stable cooperation with shippers. The aim of this paper is to create a deeper understanding of how and which emerging technologies accelerate sustainability strategy of shipping companies. Three research perspectives have been adopted. The first one is aimed to examine shipowners' approach to emerging technologies as a tool to improve their corporate sustainability performance. The second perspective gives a view of trends in the development of emerging technologies in shipping and how they related to sustainability. Taking the third perspective, we examine how effective, in the opinion of future seafarers, the use of emerging technologies is in improving corporate sustainability of shipping companies. The research methods for each of the perspectives are, respectively, a sustainability reports and ships' registry data analysis, a patent analysis, and a questionnaire survey analysis. The results prove that shipowners use not only certain management practices, but also new technologies to enhance corporate sustainability. The transition to sustainable shipping will continue for many years to come and all shipping companies will have to become part of it.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Trademarks and firm market value: Evidence from new trademark-firm linked data in China,Trademark; Frims market value; First-to-file; Intellectual property right(IPR); China; Energing economy; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; INNOVATION; LAW; PRODUCT; ISOMORPHISM; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; PROTECTION; ECONOMICS; STRATEGY,"A growing stream of research conducted in developed economies has shown that trademarks are positively related to firms' market value. However, we have limited understanding of whether this finding might apply to emerging economies, many of which have developed their own unique trademark regimes and are currently experiencing exponential growth in trademark registrations. In this study, we address this gap by constructing a new dataset that links trademark registrations with listed firms in China-the first of its kind for Chinese trademarks. Using this dataset, we find that in-use trademarks (trademarks being used by firms), as well as unused trademarks registered for a firm's current businesses, are positively related to firm value; further, the strength of IPR protection in subnational regions (provinces in China) amplifies these relationships. By contrast, unused trademarks that are not registered for a firm's current businesses have no impact on firm value. We also find that trademarks and patents complement each other in enhancing firm value. We call for more future research attention to trademarks in emerging economies to improve existing understanding of the important role trademarks play in these fast-growing markets often featuring unique IPR regimes.",2024,Business & Economics,0

Legal incentives for innovations in the emotional AI domain: a carrot and stick approach?,; ,"center dot Emotions strongly influence the human way of living and life experiences. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are crucial to pushing developments further. Although emotional AI-driven innovations are welcome in our society, they might also have negative effects on the interdependence and autonomy of natural persons. Thus, they might be challenged by several legal provisions in the EU such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the draft AI Act. Yet these inventions require considerable investment, where legal incentives such as intellectual property rights (IPR) are crucial. Indeed, it is also important to secure certainty as to the legal and ethical acceptability of such innovations. center dot This article looks at emotional AI to investigate the interlinkage between technological innovations, legal incentives and ethics, through the lenses of patent law and fundamental rights, in order to shed light over the challenges, limitations, but also opportunities for the protection, commercialization and exploitation of emotional AI-related inventions. center dot Our research offers new scientific knowledge on the largely under-explored issue of legal incentives for emotional AI-related inventions in the European framework. It also provides companies and inventors with key points to consider in decision-making related to investments in and incentives for emotional AI-related innovations, also elaborating on suggestions for the European legislator and policymakers to better stimulate and promote emotional AI technology through regulation.",2024,Government & Law,0
Endovascular Treatment of Spontaneous Internal Carotid Artery Dissection with Proximal Embolic Protection Device,; LONG-TERM OUTCOMES,"Background: The aim of this study was to report the feasibility and outcomes with the endovas- cular treatment of spontaneous internal carotid artery dissections (ICADs) using a proximal embolic protection device (EPD). Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients treated for spontaneous symptomatic ICAD using a proximal EPD from January 2017 to December 2018. Indication for treatment was the presence of neurologic symptoms. Early outcomes measured included technical suc- cess, perioperative mortality, and major cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications. Late outcomes were recurrent neurologic symptoms, patency, and reinterventions. Results: A total of 4 male patients with ICAD were included. A preoperative cerebral computed tomography positive for cerebral ischemic events was reported in all cases. In 3 patients, the neurologic symptoms consisted of a transient ischemic attack; the remaining patient presented an amaurosis fugax and aphasia. In 2 patients, ICAD was associated with a carotid significant stenosis. In all patients, the reported approach was feasible with no complications and complete anatomic dissection resolution. At a mean follow-up of 18 months, all stents are patent and no restenosis recurrence or complications were registered. Conclusions: The use of proximal EPDs allowed the treatment of ICAD under flow arrest, mini- mizing the risk of stroke during the endovascular maneuvers. Larger series are required to vali- date this treatment strategy.",2020,Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,0
Intellectual Property and Tabletop Games,; PIRACY PARADOX; TRADE SECRETS; LAW; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; SEARCH; NORMS,"There is a rich body of literature regarding intellectual property's (IP) negative spaces-fields where creation and innovation thrive without significant formal protection from IP law. Scholars have written about innovation in diverse fields despite weak or nonexistent IP rights, such as fashion design, fine cuisine, stand-up comedy, magic tricks, tattoos, and sports plays. Instead, these fields rely on social norms, first-mover advantage, and other (non IP)legal regimes to promote innovation in the absence of IP protection. As a comparison to these studies, this Article comprehensively analyzes the role of IP law in facilitating innovation in tabletop gaming, including board games, card games, and pen-and-paper role-playing games. Over the past several decades, the tabletop gaming industry has seen a proliferation of innovation, but there is surprisingly little in the academic literature about IP and tabletop games. IP rights, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, each protect certain aspects of games, while at the same time being constrained by doctrinal limitations that leave considerable flexibility for others to develop their own games and adapt or improve upon existing ones. There are also numerous examples of user-based innovation in tabletop gaming. This Article concludes by contending that IP rights, as well as their limitations, play a significant role in facilitating the robust innovation presently occurring in the tabletop gaming field.",2022,Government & Law,0
The Evolutionary Path and Emerging Trends of Circulating Fluidized Bed Technology: An Integrated Analysis through Bibliometric Assessment and Data Visualization,circulating fluidized bed; domain development trend; bibliometrics; knowledge mapping; COMBUSTION,"Confronted with the significant challenges of global climate change and environmental deterioration, the pursuit of carbon emission peaks and the realization of carbon neutrality have become a collective goal for countries worldwide. As an exemplary combustion technology noted for its efficiency and environmental friendliness, the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) is instrumental in curbing the release of carbon dioxide alongside other deleterious gases. The technology is pivotal in promoting the clean and efficient use of coal, simultaneously expediting the global shift towards a sustainable, green, and low-carbon future. This study employs a bibliometric analysis, a social network analysis, and information visualization techniques to delve into the evolution of CFB technology, leveraging the Web of Science database (SCI-EXPANDED and CPCI-S) and the Derwent Innovations Index (DII). Through a meticulous examination of academic papers and patent literature related to CFB technology, this research unveils the developmental trajectory and trends of CFB technology, providing a scientific foundation and reference for strategic technology planning and focused research in key areas. The findings indicate that, while there is a downward trend in the global publication of academic papers on CFB technology, the number of patent applications continues to grow steadily. CFB technology has achieved significant advancements in enhancing combustion efficiency, environmental protection, energy utilization, and waste management, and is progressing towards a direction of diversification and greater efficiency. Moving forward, the development of CFB technology should concentrate on pivotal areas such as material science, fluid dynamics simulation, environmental impact assessment, system integration, and intelligentization, to foster ongoing innovation and a broad application of the technology.",2024,Energy & Fuels,0
"Comprehensive Data Integration Approach to Assess Immune Responses and Correlates of RTS,S/AS01-Mediated Protection From Malaria Infection in Controlled Human Malaria Infection Trials",correlates of protection; immune response; malaria; vaccine; machine learning; FC-GAMMA RECEPTORS; PHASE-3 TRIAL; VACCINE; EFFICACY; SAFETY; EBI2,"RTS,S/AS01 (GSK) is the world's first malaria vaccine. However, despite initial efficacy of almost 70% over the first 6 months of follow-up, efficacy waned over time. A deeper understanding of the immune features that contribute to RTS,S/AS01-mediated protection could be beneficial for further vaccine development. In two recent controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) trials of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in malaria-naive adults, MAL068 and MAL071, vaccine efficacy against patent parasitemia ranged from 44% to 87% across studies and arms (each study included a standard RTS,S/AS01 arm with three vaccine doses delivered in four-week-intervals, as well as an alternative arm with a modified version of this regimen). In each trial, RTS,S/AS01 immunogenicity was interrogated using a broad range of immunological assays, assessing cellular and humoral immune parameters as well as gene expression. Here, we used a predictive modeling framework to identify immune biomarkers measured at day-of-challenge that could predict sterile protection against malaria infection. Using cross-validation on MAL068 data (either the standard RTS,S/AS01 arm alone, or across both the standard RTS,S/AS01 arm and the alternative arm), top-performing univariate models identified variables related to Fc effector functions and titer of antibodies that bind to the central repeat region (NANP6) of CSP as the most predictive variables; all NANP6-related variables consistently associated with protection. In cross-study prediction analyses of MAL071 outcomes (the standard RTS,S/AS01 arm), top-performing univariate models again identified variables related to Fc effector functions of NANP6-targeting antibodies as highly predictive. We found little benefit-with this dataset-in terms of improved prediction accuracy in bivariate models vs. univariate models. These findings await validation in children living in malaria-endemic regions, and in vaccinees administered a fourth RTS,S/AS01 dose. Our findings support a quality as well as quantity hypothesis for RTS,S/AS01-elicited antibodies against NANP6, implying that malaria vaccine clinical trials should assess both titer and Fc effector functions of anti-NANP6 antibodies.",2021,Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
PATENTABILITY OF COMPUTER PROGRAM ALGORITHMS IN THE G20 STATES,algorithm; computer program; patentability; software patent; intellectual property; G20; BRICS; ,"Ubiquitous computerization and digitalization are contributing to the unprecedented growth of the software market. Computer programs are protected as subject of copyright law in international law and domestic legal systems. However, copyright law does not protect the interests of the copyright holder from borrowing ideas and algorithms which often have a great commercial value. This circumstance has prompted the legal science and law enforcement practice of the most developed states to justify the possibility of protecting computer programs and their algorithms. The leading states chosen for in this paper are the G20 states. The relevance of this choice is due to the following: 1) The G20 states account for 86% of global GDP; 2) All world leaders in computer software development are G20 members; 3) All BRICS states are G20 members; 4) The law-and-orders of the G20 states are relevant to all existing traditions of the legal protection of intellectual property in the world. The legal systems of the G20 states follow one of three approaches according to the criterion of patentability of computer programs and their algorithms. We call the first approach neutral. It includes States which legislation does not explicitly prohibit the patenting of computer programs, but computer programs themselves are not mentioned among the subject matters of inventions. The second (positive) approach includes those states which legislation explicitly classifies computer programs as patentable inventions. On the contrary, the third (negating) approach includes states where it is legally established that computer programs as such are unpatentable. The results of the research demonstrate that there is no direct correlation between the way of solving the issue of patentability of computer program algorithms in different legal systems and the state's place in the global IT market. For example, the United States and China take a neutral approach, Japan takes a positive approach, the EU Member States and India take a negating approach. We believe that the most flexible approach is a neutral approach from the point of view of patent law policy. The most liberal and consistent approach is the positive approach presented by the Japanese legal system. Finally, the negating approach is the most controversial and at the same time widespread among the G20 and BRICS states.",2022,Government & Law,0
The genome history of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis: From discovery to present day product,Bacillus cereus group; biological control; cry3Aa; plasmid recombination; prophage; whole-genome sequencing; ,"Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis (Btt) was discovered in 1982 and has been used as a biological control agent against the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) since the early 1990s. In this study, we sequenced, assembled and analysed the genome of strain DSM 2803, which is the patent deposit of the original Btt isolate BI 256-82. A high-quality reference genome is provided that allows investigating the genomic changes throughout the commercial history of Btt. Strain DSM 2803 (BI 256-82) is particularly interesting since the subspecies description of 'tenebrionis' is based on it and because it represents the genomic origin of the commercial Btt strain currently used in plant protection. Comparative genome analysis of six Btt strains derived from BI 256-82 revealed that the genomes were generally highly similar. However, some plasticity in the profile of extrachromosomal elements was detected, including recombination-dependent plasmid differences and the presence/absence of a circular plasmid-like prophage.",2024,Entomology,0

Moreover, R&D activity is increasingly acknowledged as an important contributing factor to global post-pandemic economic recovery. However, little is known about the determinants of R&D intensity (the share of R&D expenditure in GDP) and countries have repeatedly missed their set targets for this indicator. This article tackles this issue for a global panel consisting of 62 countries over the period 2007-2015 by using a dynamic system-generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) panel model to uncover driving factors for R&D intensity. We also perform investigations on two homogenous subpanels constructed based on the income level of sample countries (High-income, and Middle- and Low-income subpanels), which contributes to assuring the robustness of results, along with formal model diagnostics and employment of alternative explanatory variables. We mainly find that the number of researchers is the most important driving factor for R&D intensity. High-technology exports have a statistically significant effect on R&D intensity only in middle and low-income countries. Patents are conducive to R&D intensity only in the high-income panel. Trade-openness is a significant mitigating factor for R&D investments throughout the panels and model specifications. Policy implications of results are also discussed.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Intellectual property on forecasting and profiling models,Intellectual property; copyright; patent; forecasting model; profiling model; property artificial intelligence; big data; open data; database; data; derivative work; ,"Forecasting and profiling models have become an important player in today's market and are undoubtedly part of the broader genus of artificial intelligence systems, as also confirmed by the recent definitions provided by the European legislator. Since they are complex intellectual creations that require high skills and huge investments, it is important to reflect on their protection in terms of so-called intellectual property. This article provides a general overview of forecasting/profiling models from a legal point of view, proceeding by assimilation to the various forms of intellectual creation already codified by IP law. It then goes on to identify the exclusive rights that come into play, with the relative owners and limits of application.

The influencing factors and pathways of China's green finance development towards the Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality -evidence from fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis based on 30 provinces of China,carbon peaking; carbon neutrality; green finance; fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis; sustainable development; ,"In the context of the Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality, the significance of green development, including the development of green finance, has gained increasing attention. It is important to explore the factors and pathways that have impacts on the progress of green finance; however, these are not clearly defined. In this paper, using data from 30 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) in China, we investigate the factors that drives the advancement of green finance in China. We utilize the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) technique to scrutinize the effects of economic development, industrial structure, government investment in environmental protection and green innovation capability on the progress of green finance development. The results show that the development of green finance is not solely dependent on the four aforementioned conditions alone. However, according to the group analysis, we find three pathways towards achieving the development of green finance, among which the conditions show relationships of complementarity and substitutability. In order to promote the growth of green finance in China, the local government should leverage the distinctive characteristics of the regions by the method of encouraging green patents, developing clean and green projects and strengthening the regional innovation capacity. Furthermore, the government should play a leading role in enhancing the promotion of green patent applications. Finally, it is essential for each region to conduct a comprehensive analysis of their local resources and devise differentiated strategies for the development of green finance.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
How Does Environmental Regulation and Digital Finance Affect Green Technological Innovation: Evidence From China,digital finance; green technological innovation; spatial spillover effect; moderating effect; environmental regulation; INDUCE,"With the deteriorating ecological environment, green technological innovation (GTI) has become an effective way to strengthen environmental protection and promote economic development. Based on the 2011-2019 panel data of 30 provinces in China, this study constructs a spatial Durbin model to examine the spatial spillover effect of environmental regulation and digital finance on green technological innovation. Meanwhile, a moderating effect model and threshold effect model are employed to explore the function of digital finance in terms of the impact of environmental regulation on green technological innovation. The empirical results show that: 1) environmental regulation has significantly promoted local GTI, green invention patents (GIP) and green utility model patents (GUP), while having had negative spatial spillover effects on those three things in neighboring regions. Digital finance promotes GTI and GIP in both local and neighboring areas, but digital finance's direct and spatial spillover effects on GUP are not significant. 2) A regional analysis shows that different intensities of environmental regulation and different digital finance levels in different regions lead to the heterogeneity of green technological innovation's response to them. 3) Digital finance produces a positive moderating effect on environmental regulation affecting GTI and GIP in local and neighboring regions. However, digital finance's moderating effect in terms of the influence of environmental regulation on GUP is not significant. 4) When digital finance reaches a certain threshold, environmental regulation will have a stronger role in promoting GTI. Therefore, to improve regional green technology innovation and environmental governance, the government should strengthen the integration of digital technology and financial services, and promote the construction of environmental supervision systems and green innovation policy systems.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
THERMALY ACTIVE INTERIOR PANELS WITH AN INTEGRATED ACTIVE AREA,Indoor thermally active panels (ITAP); Active heating/cooling surface; ,"Panels with an integrated active area can be used for interior applications for walls, ceilings and floor heating, and alternatively as a wet or dry type of construction. At present, most panels with an integrated active area are made of gypsum boards with milled channels and embedded pipes. Some manufacturers already supply these panels with thermal insulation (Radwan et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020). Certain limitations, mainly regarding the diameter and material of the pipes, apply to the panels with channels milled in the gypsum board and embedded pipes. These limitations are closely related to the high cost of such panels and to the limited heat/cooling output. The disadvantages of these panels are eliminated by the construction of a thermal insulation panel with active thermal protection for application with an active heat transfer control system (indoor thermally active panel (ITAP)) in accordance with European Patent No. EP 2 572 057 B1 (Kalus, 2011).",2021,Engineering,0

She could walk and talk, but could not swallow. Her vital signs were all within normal limits. There were no abnormal findings in the oral cavity. The neck x-ray images revealed the patent airway and foreign body in the hypopharynx.

We consider the limit on the market power of firms as a policy instrument and derive its optimal levels for workers and capitalists, respectively. Capitalists prefer powerful monopolistic firms, but even workers prefer firms to have some market power because profit provides incentives for innovation. Workers' utility-maximizing degree of monopoly power is decreasing in their discount rate but increasing in innovation productivity and the quality step size. Capitalists' utility-maximizing degree of monopoly power is increasing in the quality step size. We use the difference in these two degrees of monopoly power to measure the severity of their conflict, which becomes less severe when workers' discount rate falls or innovation productivity rises. Finally, at a small (large) quality step size, enlarging it mitigates (worsens) their conflict.",2023,Business & Economics,0

Transmitting knowledge to a more capable supplier therefore creates competitive threat despite the benefits it brings within an outsourcing relationship. In particular, in markets with less differentiated products and for standard inputs that require less knowledge to be shared, choosing an intermediate capability level supplier prompts a strategic expansion of output to deter supplier entry in the final goods market, resulting in higher profits and welfare. A highly capable supplier is instead accommodated as a rival and is a source of royalty income when the relationship-specific input embeds more knowledge about the final product and when the competing varieties are differentiated.",2021,Business & Economics; International Relations,0
Stock Market Liberalization and Corporate Green Innovation: Evidence from China,capital market liberalization; green innovation; Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program; Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect program; ,"Corporate green innovation is an effective way to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction. Enterprises' willingness to pursue green innovation is increasingly affected by external factors. By using a quasi-natural experiment of China's Stock Connect program, we investigate the impact of stock market liberalization on corporate green innovation. We find that stock market liberalization increases enterprises' green innovation, especially for state-owned enterprises. We also find that stock market liberalization plays a stronger role in promoting the green invention patents of enterprises whose managers have overseas experience and enterprises in areas with a higher degree of openness. Our mechanism analysis suggests that stock market liberalization attracts the attention of securities analysts and increases managers' focus on environmental protection, thereby promoting corporate green innovation.

Examination and Approval of New Patents in an Endogenous Growth Model,Endogenous growth; R&D; Variety innovation; Examination duration; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS; PROTECTION; PATENTABILITY; POLICY,"This study introduces the examination duration for newly developed goods into a standard R&D-based growth model. Producing such goods requires approval from an authority, and their examination incurs both cost and time. Thus, there is a lag between invention and production. This study investigates the effects of reducing the examination duration on examination backlogs (the number of newly invented goods under examination), economic growth, and welfare. We obtain an inverted-U shaped relationship between backlogs and duration, because reducing the duration decreases backlogs by accelerating the examination process, but simultaneously increases backlogs by promoting R&D and increasing the number of applications. In addition, we demonstrate that reducing the examination duration promotes economic growth. However, a rather short examination duration needs considerable resources as the examination has a higher cost. Thus, an extremely short duration hurts welfare. Our numerical analysis reveals the existence of an optimal examination duration.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Research and market structure: Evidence from an antibiotic-resistant pathogenic outbreak,Economics of science; Antibiotics resistance; India; Multinationals; Technological abandonment; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; WELFARE IMPLICATIONS; PATENT PROTECTION; PRODUCT RECALLS; INNOVATION; INDIA; REPUTATION; SIZE; TECHNOLOGY; PHYSICIANS,"We provide causal evidence that upstream research shocks impact unconnected downstream product markets. Focusing on the Indian pharmaceutical market, we use a natural experiment involving a publication that identified a pathogenic outbreak involving a carbapenem antibiotic resistant superbug. Consistent with theory, we find that this upstream research shock caused multinational firms selling carbapenem antibiotics in India to reduce their downstream market exposure. Rational antibiotic stewardship implies that we should observe a similar response by domestic Indian firms. Surprisingly, we observe the opposite, domestic Indian firms filled the void in the market left by multinational firms. We confirm this aggregate finding with prescription level data; Indian physicians prescribed fewer focal multinational products relative to domestic firm products. Results are robust to alternate control groups and placebo testing. Implications for antibiotic resistance, global health policy and innovation policy are discussed.",2023,Business & Economics,0

Merr.] represents one of the most essential crops to the world's economy and food security due to its unique seed composition. Public soybean breeding programs in the United States played an important role in developing the genetic basis of American soybean and discovering many economically important traits. After the passage of the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVP) in 1970 and the authorization to patent living matter in 1980, private companies have dominated the market share of commercial soybean varieties and public breeding programs shifted the efforts towards basic and applied research and education of the next generation of plant breeders. The short history of soybean breeding combined with a very narrow genetic basis derived from few ancestors can only make us reflect on all the innovations yet to be unveiled and the multiple possibilities to explore the unique traits that the golden miracle bean offers.",2021,Agriculture; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0
ROTADIAL: The first nanobody-based immunoassay to detect Group A Rotavirus,Nanobody; Rotavirus; Elisa; Diagnostics; VACCINATION; PROTECTION; DIARRHEA; PROTEIN; ELISA,"ROTADIAL is a rapid nanobody (Nb)-based ELISA assay able to identify Rotavirus group A (RVA) in feces from pediatric patients. The assay is based on a sandwich of two patented llama-derived Nbs directed to the inner capsid viral protein VP6 from RVA. Nbs are directed to conformational epitopes of VP6 and recognized all human RVA strains tested, representing ideal reagents for their use in immunodiagnostic tests for RVA detection. All the steps are carried out at room temperature, bringing results in less than two hours. This assay, named ROTADIAL, was validated with a reference panel of feces from pediatric patients from Argentina. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the ROTADIAL test, when compared to a commercial test, was 100 % (100/100) and 99 % (99/100) respectively. ROTADIAL presented optimal analytical performance, being capable of detecting RVA regardless of the presence of other common human enteric infectious agents and is the first RVA-diagnostic assay developed using Nbs, worldwide.",2021,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Virology,0

We find that the 2014 reforms effectively motivate minority shareholders to attend shareholder meetings and greatly enhance their voting influence. We also find that enhanced minority voting power after the reforms lowers the number of firms' patent applications, and this effect is more pronounced for the firms that see the greatest increase in shareholder attendance at shareholder meetings. Moreover, enhanced minority voting power boosts executive turnover-performance sensitivity, thereby undermining firm innovation. Finally, we show that different types of minority shareholders have distinct impacts on firm innovation, depending on their investment horizons. The negative effect of minority voting power is more pronounced for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than for non-SOEs.",2023,Business & Economics,0

The narratives of innovation and exports are important for national competitiveness. Therefore, this study, utilizing a meta-regression analysis, examines the impact of innovation on export performances. We conduct a meta-analysis from 27 empirical studies that contain 249 estimates undertaken during 1996-2019 with an aim to test whether the results of empirical studies are sensitive to various measures utilized and recognize possible policy implications. This study finds that innovation affects export performance across countries. We find strong evidence that developed countries' domestic innovation enhance their exports; however, for developing countries, innovation does not contribute to their exports. It indicates that within developing countries, the level of innovation efforts varies and concomitantly their inability to translate such efforts into exports.",2023,Area Studies,0

It is reported that major customers positively impact corporate green innovation, indicating that firms have more incentives to engage in innovative green practices to maintain stable relationships with major customers. In addition, the positive relationship between customer concentration and green innovation is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises, firms located in the provinces with a high level of marketization, and after China's new Environmental Protection Law implementation. Moreover, we observe that the positive impact of customer concentration on corporate green innovation is more significant among industrial firms and firms operating in heavily polluting industries. Furthermore, industrial competition is an essential channel for major customers to affect corporate green innovation.",2023,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Optimal tariffs in a two-country R&D-based growth model,Optimal tariffs; Economic growth; R&D; Trade in intermediate goods; PATENT PROTECTION; TRADE LIBERALIZATION; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; TAX-REFORM; WELFARE; OPENNESS; PRODUCTIVITY; EXPENDITURE; COMPETITION,"This paper examines the effect of a tariff on long-run growth and welfare in a two-country innovation-led growth model. We show that although raising the home country's tariff reduces the growth and GDP of the foreign country, it will backfire by depressing R&D and growth of the home country. The Nash equilibrium tariffs can be positive, and they are larger when the government expenditure is more beneficial to private production and/or when the productivity of innovation is higher. The presence of positive Nash equilibrium tariffs provides a theoretical explanation for why countries have incentives to implement a tariff policy regardless of its negative effect on growth. Finally, the Nash equilibrium tariffs are higher than the globally optimal tariffs, that is, the levels that maximize the joint welfare of both countries.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Addressing Criminal Liability for Misuse of Trade Secrets Under Australian Law: Is the Current Legal Framework Adequate to Protect the Interests of Owners of Trade Secrets?,Trade secrets; Espionage and Foreign Interference Act; Economic Espionage Act; DTSA; TRIPS Agreement; Patents; ACT,"The emergence and dominance of knowledge-based economies have heightened the importance of trade secrets as a currency for attaining competitiveness in the market and driving innovation. Yet espousing policies to govern trade secret protection, especially in the criminal law sphere, was not something on which legislative and regulatory policymakers traditionally focused. Recent legislative incentives at a global level have caused the tide to shift and, after decades of being somewhat neglected, the questions pertaining to criminal liability for trade secret misuse are finally gaining attention. The Australian response to recent initiatives ensued in 2018 with the enactment of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (EFI Act) which introduced the first statutory provisions dedicated to criminalisation of state-sponsored theft (economic espionage) of trade secrets. This Act, however, does not provide a comprehensive legal framework to address criminal liability for trade secret misuse, as it leaves outside the scope of its regulation the criminalisation of the theft of trade secrets by individuals for their own benefit. This paper analyses the adequacy of the Australian legal regime concerning criminal liability for trade secret misuse. The analysis is informed by a comparison of the legal provisions of the Australian trade secret regime with that adopted in the United States (U.S.) which currently offers a comprehensive framework of protection and criminalises economic espionage as well as the theft of trade secrets. This comparative analysis serves to determine: first, whether the one way avenue of statutory protection under Australian law suffices to protect the interests of the owners of trade secrets; and, second, whether a potential reform of the regime designed to include dedicated statutory provisions to criminalise the theft of trade secrets, as is the case in the U.S., could potentially afford a more adequate protection of the interests of trade secret owners.",2024,Government & Law,0

Thus, the purpose of this research is to increase understanding on the impact of diverse knowledge search and knowledge formal protection in international new ventures (INVs). Design/methodology/approach The study uses a quantitative methodology based on a sample of start-ups from the Spanish Community Innovation Survey data. Using ordinary least squares regressions on a 10-year period panel data, this research tests the moderator role of a heterogeneous base of international partners and formal knowledge appropriation strategy on the relationship between start-ups and their export performance. Findings The results show that compared to non-born global start-ups, born global firms benefit more from establishing relationships with a set of heterogeneous international partners. By contrast, all start-ups benefit from an extensive appropriation strategy if they establish such alliances with diverse international partners. Originality/value The study extends current theory on international entrepreneurship by providing a new theoretical framework for INVs of both the extensive use of formal mechanisms of knowledge protection and the access to heterogeneous and distant knowledge. This study has also several implications for knowledge management domain.",2022,Business & Economics,0

At the same time SMEs, as territorialized suppliers, play a crucial role within evolving regional specialization. In this context the purpose of our study is to examine how low and medium technology supplier SMEs learn and organize themselves at a territorial level to address the challenge of IP protection in an open innovation paradigm. We used a qualitative method with a longitudinal multi-case study involving 27 companies with a historical lance to compare the territorial dynamics of knowledge protection within clustered supplier SMEs in two European regions. The results show they protect their knowledge by learning how to design, in a direct relationship with clients, customized complex technological products to develop a new organizational matrix of multidisciplinary knowledge that reveals itself difficult to imitate within the clusters. They also cope with other supplier firms across sectors even if they show societal path dependencies in the way to build cooperation. This dynamic has given birth to changing structural relationships among regionally clustered SMEs and between them and large firms.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Yet, agreements also leave 'room to maneuver' through the use of constructive ambiguity, that is, by defining treaty terms with deliberately ambiguous words. When are countries more likely to exploit this treaty ambiguity? What does this exploitation look like? We argue that in democratic countries, where states face continued pressures to react to domestic needs, governments are more likely to legislate unambiguous circumstances in which they can apply international treaty exceptions. We argue this should be especially true in developing democracies facing external pressure from foreign firms and developed countries to legislate public policy with their external interests in mind. We test our theory in the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and compulsory licensing legislation for HIV/AIDS drugs between 2000 and 2012. We find that when public access to medicines for HIV/AIDS is limited but in high demand, democratic governments are more likely to legislate explicit public health protection under TRIPS exceptions, especially in developing countries with high rates of foreign patent ownership. We conclude that such exploitation is most likely when countries seek to prevent precedents by action, or adjudication, that better define constructively ambiguous treaty terms.",2024,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,0
The environmental and economic consequences of environmental centralization: Evidence from China's environmental vertical management reform,Vertical management reform; Environmental decentralization; Environmental centralization; Transboundary environmental pollution; Green patents; FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION; POLITICAL CENTRALIZATION; POLLUTION REGULATION; GROWTH; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; ENFORCEMENT; INDUSTRY; QUALITY; INSTITUTIONS,"Environmental decentralization enhances local autonomy accountability and initiatives. However, some evidence suggests that it might foster a race to the bottom in environmental protection, exacerbating cross-border pollution. Consequently, certain areas in China initiated the vertical management reform of environmental protection agencies (VMR), characterized by centralization, in 1992. The relatively exogenous shock on firms helps to identify the causal effect of VMR on pollution and production. Using the combined data of ASIF and ESR from 1998 to 2013, along with collected policy details at the county-level, we utilize the staggered DID design. Our findings demonstrate that VMR significantly reduces approximately 22.94% of COD emissions from industrial firms. This reduction is achieved through passive approaches such as reducing production, decreasing the entry of firms, and increasing the rate of firms shutting down. Additionally, a proactive approach of increasing the wastewater treatment capacity of individual facilities contributes to this reduction. The impact of VMR is significant in polluting industries, large-scale firms, and firms located at administrative boundaries, mainly driven by local officials with strong promotion incentives. The paper underscores the advantages of environmental centralization, particularly the role of VMR in addressing environmental pollution, especially in the context of transboundary issues. However, due to information asymmetry within centralization, its implementation incurs high economic costs, necessitating more precise and sophisticated regulation.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Survey and Analysis of Chemoprophylaxis Policies for Domestic Travel in Malaria-Endemic Countries,domestic travel chemoprophylaxis; malaria; tafenoquine; RISK-FACTOR; TRANSMISSION; REGION,"The prevention of malaria in travelers with the use of antimalarials often occurs in connection with international travel to areas of significant risk of infection. Although these travelers sometimes cause outbreaks in their malaria-free home countries, the cardinal objective of prescribed chemoprophylaxis is to protect the traveler from patent malaria during travel. Here we consider the chemoprophylaxis of domestic travelers from malaria-free but -receptive areas within malaria-endemic countries. The main objective in this setting is the protection of those areas from reintroduced malaria transmission. In order to better understand policy and practices in this regard, we surveyed malaria prevention and treatment guidelines of 36 malaria-endemic countries and 2 that have recently eliminated malaria (Sri Lanka, China) for recommendations regarding malaria chemoprophylaxis for domestic travel. Among them, just 8 provided specific and positive recommendations, 1 recommended without specific guidance, and 4 advised against the practice. Most nations (25/38; 66%) did not mention chemoprophylaxis for domestic travel, though many of those did offer guidance for international travel. The few positive recommendations for domestic travel were dominated by the suppressive prophylaxis options of daily doxycycline or atovaquone-proguanil or weekly mefloquine. The incomplete protection afforded by these strategies, along with impractical dosing in connection with the typically brief domestic travel, may in part explain the broad lack of policies and practices across malaria-endemic nations regarding chemoprophylaxis.",2022,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,0
Innovation Cooperation Network Evolution About Green Building Technology With Government Intervention: Based on Evolutionary Game Theory,Technological innovation; Government; Games; Biological system modeling; Green buildings; Instruments; Game theory; Green building technology; innovation cooperation network; evolution game; STRATEGIES; ADOPTION; INDUSTRY; DRIVERS,"Green building technologies (GBTs) are becoming increasingly complex and are being rapidly updated. These factors lead to an inherent demand for GBT innovation cooperation. This article considers the common policy instruments of the Chinese government and builds a GBT innovation cooperation network by joint patent applications. Then, evolutionary game models are constructed based on the GBT innovation cooperation network. Numerical simulation is employed to analyze the impact of different policy intervention intensities on the decision-making behavior of enterprises and network structures. The results show that government intervention is reasonable and legitimate for GBT innovation cooperation. Subsidies, preferential tax policy, and intellectual property protection are the main policy instruments of the Chinese government. When subsidies and preferential tax policy exceed certain thresholds, network efficiency and network cooperation density can be improved. In addition, the simulation results show that green building intellectual property protection in China has difficulty stimulating the enthusiasm of GBT innovation enterprises. GBT innovation cooperation network efficiency and network cooperation density evolution trends are basically the same. This study also provides insights into government policy formulation and adds to the increasing literature on the topic of GBT innovation cooperation. It is one of the few studies to explore the impact of government policy instruments on GBT innovation cooperation.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,0
Diversity and heterotic patterns in North American proprietary dent maize germplasm,; INBRED LINES; ASSOCIATION; TRAITS; MODEL; CORN,"Publicly available maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines with expired Plant Variety Protection certificates (ex-PVP) constitute the elite germplasm used in hybrids grown by North American farmers during the past half century. A set of 329 ex-PVP inbreds and eight public reference inbreds was evaluated for genetic diversity using molecular marker and pedigree-based relationships. The majority of inbreds originated from Dekalb Genetics Corporation, Holden's Foundation Seed, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, and Syngenta via Novartis and Northrup King. Flowering ranged from 968-1806 growing degree days to anthesis, supporting that these inbreds represent adaptation across the range of North American production environments. Admixture analysis supported eight subgroups (B14, B37, B73, Oh43, Iodent, Iodent-Lancaster, Lancaster, and Flint), reflecting heterotic patterns and company of origin. Five diallel-cross experiments identified primary yield heterotic patterns within early, intermediate-, and late-maturity groups. Parental pedigree information was compiled for 2392 Plant Variety Protection and/or utility patented inbreds through 2017, allowing for multigenerational analysis of progenitors and the eight heterotic subgroups across current proprietary breeding programs. Key progenitors were identified for recently merged companies, Bayer Crop Science and Corteva Agriscience. The results of this study strengthen the value of the ex-PVP inbreds as a source of elite and relevant germplasm for breeders and researchers to exploit. This study provides information that will be logistically useful to researchers who use ex-PVP inbreds and adds to our understanding of heterotic grouping within North American proprietary germplasm.",2020,Agriculture,0
Open Innovation Intellectual Property Risk Maturity Model: An Approach to Measure Intellectual Property Risks of Software Firms Engaged in Open Innovation,open innovation intellectual property risk score; open innovation intellectual property risk maturity; open innovation; intellectual property risks; IP risk management; analytic hierarchy process; conceptual model; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; CAPABILITY; CREATION; PARADOX; PATENTS,"Open innovation (OI) is key to sustainable product development and is increasingly gaining significance as the preferred model of innovation across industries. When compared to closed innovation, the protection of intellectual property (IP) that is created in open innovation is complex. For organisations engaging in OI, a sound IP management policy focusing on IP risk reduction plays a significant role in ensuring their sustained growth. Assessing the risks that are involved in IP management will enable firms to devise appropriate IP management strategies, which would ensure sufficient protection of an IP that is created in an OI model. Studies indicate that the risks which are associated with IP and risk management processes also vary with company segments that range from start-ups to micro, small, medium, and large organisations. This paper proposes an open innovation IP risk assessment model to compute the open innovation intellectual property risk score (OIIPRS) by employing an analytic hierarchy process. The OIIPRS indicates the IP risk levels of an organisation when it engages in open innovation with other organisations. The factors contributing to IP risk are identified and further classified as configurable IP risk factors, and the impact of these factors for the various company segments is also factored in when computing the OIIPRS. Further, an OI IP risk maturity model (OIIPRMM) is proposed. This model depicts the IP risk maturity of organisations based on the computed OIIPRS on an IP risk continuum, which categorises firms into five levels of IP risk maturity. The software firms can make use of the OIIPRMM to assess the level of IP risk and adopt proactive IP protection mechanisms while collaborating with other organisations.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

A radical shift in institutional context forces firms to reevaluate the desirability and suitability of current strategies and assess the potential of new strategic opportunities. From 1970 to 1995, the Indian pharmaceutical industry operated under a process-focused intellectual property regime and enjoyed legal protection to reverse engineer brand name drugs. In 1995, this protection ended with the introduction of the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) Act. We examine the innovation response of Indian pharmaceutical firms in light of this regime shift focusing on the underlying internal factors influencing firms' strategic choices. We find that the scope and balance of firms' knowledge bases, which set capabilities and influence decision framing, dictate firms' innovative response. We further document how firms' strategic choices contribute to firm financial performance and the reshaping of the Indian pharmaceutical industry. Managerial Summary From 1970 to 1995, the Indian pharmaceutical industry operated under a process-focused intellectual property regime and enjoyed legal protection to reverse engineer brand name drugs. Following TRIPS in 1995, the intellectual property regime in India became stronger, with product patent enforcement being recognized. Indian pharmaceutical firms had to make strategic choices on the kind of innovation they would pursue under this new IP regime. This article shows that having broad and nonspecialized knowledge assets allowed firms to pursue the most novel innovation and engage in new product development. Having T-shaped assets, that is, broad knowledge scope yet narrowly focused knowledge expertise, allowed firms to pursue process-based innovation in areas close to their existing areas of expertise but not necessarily engage in new product development. The findings of this article shed light on what kind of knowledge base and workforce allows firms to adjust to technological and contextual changes.",2020,Business & Economics,0
"Technology market, product market and aggregate innovation",; INCENTIVES; PATENTS; COMMERCIALIZATION; COMPETITION; GROWTH; POLICY; FIRMS,"This paper examines the growth maximization mix for intellectual property rights (IPR) in an economy in which incumbents and outside inventors endogenously choose how to develop inventions and commercialization strategies, both of which determine the innovation rate. Outside inventors can choose to commercialize their inventions by (i) launching a new product or (ii) selling to incumbents. I find that if inventors all sell on the technology market, then protecting inventors' patents from imitation by firms raises aggregate innovation. If, instead, all inventors enter the product market, the IPR policy that regulates the ability of incumbents' patents to block the entry of improved products faces a trade-off between innovation from existing firms and inventors, which leads to a single-peaked relationship between economic growth and the blocking strength. When both commercialization strategies are chosen, a balanced IPR policy can raise aggregate innovation by encouraging inventors to choose the more efficient commercialization method.

"Economic challenges of intellectual property in the digital era: legal, economic and social aspects",intellectual property; political regimes; intellectual property protection; intellectual property rights; technology protection.; RIGHTS; INNOVATION,"In the contemporary digital era, nations are engaged in active competition, not solely within the realms of economics, but also in the domain of technology, thus establishing a new paradigm of global power dynamics. Within this framework, the economic, legal, and social hurdles associated with safeguarding intellectual property (hereinafter IP) have witnessed a significant rise. This article aims to examine the economic challenges posed by intellectual property in the digital age, considering the backdrop of intensified global competition and the imperative to maintain national competitiveness across legal, economic, and social dimensions. The article employs a statistical analysis methodology, utilizing intellectual property data obtained from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) statistics database, specifically the WIPO IP Statistics Data Center. The authors examine cross-border payments and revenues associated with intellectual property exploitation in diverse nations. Furthermore, the study investigates the composition and dynamics of intellectual property across various types (such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, and utility models) and regions, thereby facilitating an assessment of the competitive landscape and cooperative endeavors among the world's leading countries in the realm of intellectual property. The economic challenges attributed to intellectual property are scrutinized within the context of trade, investment, technological cooperation, and the competitive dynamics involving the United States, China, and the European Union. The findings reveal a notable increase in cross-border payments and intellectual property revenues, reflecting a relatively limited degree of cooperation among the world's prominent regions. This indicates a considerable competitive advantage enjoyed by the United States, European Union, and China. Notwithstanding the US hegemony and leadership within the intellectual property domain, underscored by a protectionist policy aimed at safeguarding IP rights, chiefly through the control exerted by American firms, China is progressively realizing its technological potential. This is evidenced by the escalating patent activities undertaken by Chinese companies. While China, Japan, the United States, and Korea held the foremost positions in terms of the share of Top PCT Applicants in 2022, China is gradually emerging as a leader in the realm of intellectual property. The country's leadership can be attributed to the innovative endeavors pursued by companies operating within the innovation and technology sector, with a notable emphasis on mobile technologies. Over recent years, China has surpassed Japan and the United States in terms of the number of applications filed by companies seeking to secure ownership rights for their inventions, developments, and innovations.",2023,Business & Economics,0
The Social Costs of Success: The Impact of World Trade Organization Rules on Insulin Prices in Bangladesh upon Graduation from Least Developed Country Status,affordability; cost of illness; insulin; intellectual property; low-income country; WELFARE IMPLICATIONS; PATENT PROTECTION,"In 2021, the United Nations Committee on Development Policy adopted a resolution that Bangladesh would graduate from least developed country (LDC) status after a period of 5 years. This means that in 2026 Bangladesh would have to forego its exemption to intellectual property (IP) provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Bangladesh has taken advantage of the policy space it was granted under the LDC exemption to build a generic medicines industry that not only serves Bangladesh but also other LDCs. We examine how IP provisions in the WTO will impact the price of insulin in Bangladesh and the subsequent impacts on welfare and poverty. We find that LDC graduation will trigger a significant jump in insulin prices that could cause about a 15% decline in the welfare of households in Bangladesh with one or more members living with diabetes, increasing the poverty rate of such households unless policy adjustments are carried out.",2022,Development Studies; Business & Economics,0
Has the EU Incentive for Drug Repositioning Been Effective?

This extra year, known as the +1, was enacted on limited evidence, and no study has examined its effect since it began. Yet, several leading commentators suggest lengthening the +1. This study assesses the effectiveness of the +1 by analysing all the relevant instances of MAHs repositioning their drugs before and after the +1 came into effect. The results show that: (i) 42.2% of MAHs repositioned their drugs before the +1 came into effect, and (ii) once the +1 did come into effect, it did not increase the percentage of MAHs that repositioned their drugs. This study finds that the +1 failed to increase repositioning and then proceeds to consider reform options, including repealing the law. In doing so, this study takes the first steps towards an evidence-based policy for the topic.",2021,Government & Law,0

Patients: We present a small case series of unusual aortic pathologies in patients presenting with a broad spectrum of symptoms: tiredness, dysphagia, dyspnea, arterial hypertension, renal failure, and claudication. (1). Segmental agenesia of the descending aorta. (2). Balanced double aortic arch with complete vascular ring. (3). Right descending aortic arch, left lusorian artery with Kommerell diverticulum. (4). Large patent ductus (2.5 cm) and ventricular septal defect. (5). Aneurysm of the aortic arch in the presence of tuberous sclerosis. (6). Pseudo-aneurysm of the proximal descending aorta following coarctation patch plasty. (7). Supravalvular aortic stenosis combined with severe aortic valve stenosis. (8). Pseudo-aneurysm following ascendens-to-descendens bypass because of recurrent coarctation. (9). Takayasu arteriitis with severe stenosis in the thoraco-abdominal aorta. Results: The following procedures were performed, using individualized cardiopulmonary bypass, canulation and cerebral protection strategies. (1). Ascending to supraceliac extra-anatomic bypass. (2). Division of the ductus ligament and of the anterior aortic arch distally to the left subclavian artery. (3). Excision of the Kommerell diverticulum and translocation of the left subclavian artery. (4). Patch closure of the aorto-pulmonary window (patent ductus) and closure of the ventricular septal defect. (5). Complete aortic arch replacement combined with debranching of the supra-aortic vessels. (6). Graft interposition of the proximal descending aorta. (7). Enlargement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement. (8). Exclusion of the pseudo-aneurysm, end-to-side graft interposition. (9). Ascending aorta to infrarenal aorta or ascending to bi-iliac artery bypass (planned). All patients were operated on without operative mortality. One patient died in-hospital from pulmonary complications one week after surgery. One patient is still awaiting surgery. All other patients recovered very well from the operation and did not show any residual symptoms.

Navigating the open innovation paradox: an integrative framework for adopting open innovation in pharmaceutical R&D in developing countries,Open innovation paradox; Patenting; Licensing; Collaboration; LEVERAGING OPEN INNOVATION; ACADEMIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP; DRUG DISCOVERY; INDUSTRY; KNOWLEDGE; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIES; COLLABORATION; COMMUNITIES; EVOLUTION,"In this paper, we combine evidence from eight Indian pharmaceutical firms with extant literature and global best practices to conceptualize an integrative framework addressing the open innovation paradox (OIP), i.e., the tension between intellectual protection and openness. Firms in developing countries face additional challenges in the adoption of open innovation, such as the prevalence of open science norms, weak technology transfer systems, and mistrust between universities and industry; therefore, they employ open innovation selectively for pharmaceutical research. Prior research has examined the strategies to resolve OIP in the context of developed countries; the integrative framework proposed in this paper describes strategies for resolving the OIP in the context of developing countries. This framework illuminates the coping processes of the case firms and provides guidelines to uplift and accelerate the adoption of open innovation strategies in developing countries' pharmaceutical sectors, and thus provides value to both theory and praxis.",2023,Engineering; Business & Economics,0
Impact Analysis of Large-Scale Environmental Spot Inspection Policy on Green Innovation: Evidence From China,spot inspection; command and control; innovation; spillover effect; pollution transfer; HAZE POLLUTION; REGULATIONS; ENFORCEMENT; EMPLOYMENT; COMMAND,"The spot inspection policy has been widely applied in environmental protection in China. This paper collects environmental enforcement announcements and green patent data published by Chinese government agencies from 2006 to 2015. First, it studies the impact of spot inspection on green innovation with the spatial Durbin model. Then, it analyzes spatial heterogeneity according to the eastern, central, and western regions including 29 provinces. The spot inspection policy significantly increases the green innovation of a current region with a negative spillover effect on neighboring regions. Even though this policy has the best performance in the eastern region, it leads to pollution transfer into the western region, while being ineffective in the central region. Further, analysis on the spatial spillover effects of the 29 provinces proves that 21 provinces have a positive spillover effect, while eight provinces have a negative spillover effect. The research study shows that although spot inspection is generally beneficial to green innovation, pollution transfer and policy failure exist because of spatial heterogeneity.",2021,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Answering this question can help design policies to balance redistribution against private-sector investment. In this paper, we study the pricing strategies of private-sector pharmacies after the entry of public-private dispensaries which sell discounted generic drugs. Public firm attracts away the quality agnostic consumers. The response of the private sector then depends on the underlying preferences of the residual market, composed of quality conscious consumers. We find that for drugs where this residual consumer is price sensitive, retail and wholesale prices in private firms decline in response to a shrinking market. For anti-cancer drugs, however, where quality conscious consumers are less likely to engage in price-shopping behavior, the private retailers increase prices which translate upstream as well. We also find that ex ante concentration of private players amplifies this impact. We conclude with some policy implications.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Inequity in access to vaccines: the failure of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic,Vaccines; COVID-19; Global Health; Delivery of Health Care; ,"This article summarizes the strategies used to rapidly develop COVID-19 vaccines and distribute them globally, with an emphasis on vaccines developed in western nations. It is based on interviews and information gathered regarding the response to the pandemic, both from international organizations and official documents from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. While vaccine development has been hailed as successful, their global distribution has been highly unequal. We look at how the pandemic succeeded in mobilizing large quantities of government resources, and how citizens volunteered their bodies so that clinical trials could be completed quickly. However, patents prevented the expansion of manufacturing capacity, and the governments of a few wealthy countries prioritized the protection - and in some cases overprotection - of their citizens at the expense of protecting the rest of world's population. Among the major beneficiaries of the global response to the pandemic are the leading vaccine companies, their executives, and investors. The article concludes with some of the lessons learned in this process.",2022,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0
Therapeutic antibodies in rheumatology,Treatment; Biologics; Target antigens; Biosimilars; Safety; ,"Emil von Behring's serum therapy for diphtheria was the first therapeutic use of antibodies. More than 100 years later, a new era in the treatment of rheumatic diseases began in 1998 with the approval of infliximab, an antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). The special feature of antibody therapy is the ability to bind and neutralize antigens in a highly specific manner. In addition, target cells can be eliminated by activation of the immune system. These properties of the immune system are exploited in rheumatology to eliminate inflammatory cytokines or antibody-producing B lymphocytes. The tolerability is usually good but potential side effects, such as reactivation of tuberculosis with anti-TNF alpha treatment must be considered. Currently, 20 different antibodies and fusion proteins have been approved in Germany for the treatment of various inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Biosimilars can contribute to a price reduction after the patent protection expires. Many additional target antigens are being investigated and further structural innovations (e.g., bispecific antibodies, nanobodies or coupling with small molecules) are being developed.",2024,Rheumatology,0
"Ownership, liability, patentability, and creativity issues in artificial intelligence",Artificial intelligence; law; ownership; patentability; liability; copyright; creativity; ,"While Artificial Intelligence technologies find increasing use in different industries such as transportation, healthcare and other services, it gives rise to legal complexities in respect of ownership and liability of AI, patentability of AI inventions, and creativity & ownership of AI-generated works attributable to various components of AI. The autonomous decision-making ability of AI challenges the existing IP framework. Since AI machines can think and act without any human effort, if any damage or harm occurs to the properties, does the current model of tort liability (product liability, negligence, strict liability) adequately address the legal concerns? Robust regulatory bodies and institutional mechanisms are required to develop rigorous safety standards and establish safety certification processes for AI. Even though AI inventions can be patented, many jurisdictions recognize only a human as an inventor and not the AI. With the increasing capability of AI to generate works without human intervention, there seems to be a strong case for granting copyright protection to AI-generated works. Exploring a separate legal framework for AI to reduce ambiguity and increase accountability would be in order.",2022,Computer Science,0

This study develops an invention-based perspective that considers how MNEs' profitability is influenced by the ways they organize the development of inventions across organizational boundaries (internally or collaboratively) and geographic boundaries (within or across countries). This perspective postulates that profitability is not merely driven by advantageous technological endowments but also by how such technological assets have been created. Accordingly, it explains why specific combinations of inventive activities across the two boundaries affect the likelihood of creating breakthrough inventions differently, provide different revenue and cost advantages, and have different effects on MNEs' profitability. It further explains why cross-country inventions contribute more to profitability when they are internalized, while within-country inventions are more profitable when they are created collaboratively.",2022,Business & Economics,0
An Artifact-based Simulation Method for Teaching Intellectual Property Management in an Innovation and Entrepreneurship Course,Simulation; Intellectual Property management; Artifacts-based; Learning; Self-motivation; ,"Intellectual Property (IP) protection and management is the base of an entrepreneurship ecosystem. However, how to teach IP management is a relatively new topic in Asian universities. This paper reports a simulation method for teaching IP management and its impact on student learning motivation and behavior. This method uses a computer-aided software system and random-generated artefacts to simulate new product idea, execute patent trading and coordinate student teams to compete among each other while executing an IP management strategy. The project was implemented in two universities in Hong Kong in the past three years. It is found that the simulation system is quite effective in implementing action-based learning, increasing attention, and motivating students to practice more interactive learning and teamwork. It is also found that artefacts in the simulation system help competing teams to converge group thinking, induce the follow-up group actions promptly, and at the same time develop peer support and interactions for problem solving.",2021,Business & Economics,0
TRIPS and the right to human health: A case study on Brazil's health policies and its implications,AIDS treatment; compulsory licensing; Doha Declaration; healthcare rights; intellectual property; key topics; TRIPS Agreement; ,"The incorporation of intellectual property laws in Brazil, by drafting or amending laws, as a result of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, has been a subject of political and social debate. The ambiguity of the Agreement's effects explains the Brazilian government's reluctance to address the issue, particularly concerning public health policies, as it presents a conflict between healthcare rights and intellectual property protection. The country had utilized compulsory licensing of an antiretroviral drug for AIDS treatment under Decree No. 6,108/2007. This precedent has sparked discussions about future cases of selective incorporation of compulsory licensing as a national prerogative, aiming to ensure that the patent system upholds the country's right to protect public health and promote access to medicines, in accordance with The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement. Nevertheless, such a pattern could undermine innovation and discourage private-sector investment and research, which is predominantly conducted by developed countries.",2024,Government & Law,0
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AS A PREREQUISITE FOR IMPROVEMENT OF ACCESS TO ORPHAN BIOLOGIC MEDICINES,biologic medicinal product; orphan drugs; biologics; rare diseases; biosimilars; POLICY,"Rare diseases constitute a global problem. Worldwide, 350 million people suffer from such diseases. The number of diagnosed cases are on the rise. Only a small percentage of those suffering have the opportunity to be treated with modern therapies. Medicines used to treat rare diseases are called orphan drugs. Biologic medicines developed for orphan drug indications, besides patent protection, have a period of regulatory and market exclusivity. After this period of time has elapsed, access to orphan drugs could be improved by the introduction of biosimilar medicines. The biggest challenge is to develop effective legal, tax and economic incentives to stimulate the development of biosimilar medicines for orphan indications. The regulatory agencies - EMA in the EU and the FDA in the USA - play a key role in increasing access to orphan biologics. Undoubtedly, the international cooperation, especially the mutual recognition of registration procedures between countries, and the creation of a common vocabulary and the unification of incentives for the pharmaceutical industry would have the positive impact on access to modern therapies.",2021,Government & Law,0

With progress in understanding placental malaria and associated adverse consequences, this review addresses the situation in an area with high prevalence, in Blue Nile State, Sudan, where protective interventions are not adequately provided. Recent Findings Several studies have confirmed that malaria infection during pregnancy with parasites in the placenta, even at sub-patent level detected by molecular techniques, can result in maternal morbidity, fetal growth restriction, and reduced birth weight. Thus, malaria protection measures and antenatal care are vital for pregnant women in endemic areas. Falciparumandvivax-infected erythrocytes are able to sequester in the placenta and not easily detected in peripheral blood during antenatal period. Recently, several biological biomarkers associated with malaria infection during pregnancy were detected. Such biomarkers could be used as indicators for identifying women at risk of placental infection complications, particularly when pre-eclampsia may occur.",2020,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,0

We consider both informative advertising, which young techno-logical leaders use to increase the probability of diffusion, and defensive advertising, which incumbents use to prevent the diffusion of competing products. Economic growth depends positively on the arrival rate of product innovations and the diffusion rate of innovations into the mainstream market. We show that R&D subsidies shift relative investment in-centives towards innovation and away from diffusion. This creates an inverted U-shaped relationship between R&D subsidies and both economic growth and welfare as innovations arrive more frequently, but fewer commercialize successfully. We find that advertising sub-sidies increase diffusion, growth, and welfare when advertising is purely informative. In the presence of defensive advertising, advertising subsidies lead to socially wasteful increases in resources devoted to advertising without large increases in diffusion, reducing growth and welfare.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Innovators and imitators in a world economy,Innovation; Imitation; Growth; Trade; Industrialization; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; DEVELOPMENT SPILLOVERS; GROWTH; TRADE; PROTECTION; COMPETITION; TECHNOLOGY; INVESTMENT; MIGRATION,"R&D, an important determinant of productivity, is highly concentrated in rich economies because of the slow diffusion of knowledge to developing countries given the cumulative nature of technological progress. This study presents a dynamic general equilibrium model of international trade, innovation, and technology diffusion with a continuum of countries. A point of departure from traditional trade models is that comparative advantage based on innovative and imitative R&D productivities determines the identity of innovators and imitators. Through this mechanism, the division of the world economy into two groups, North and South, endogenously emerges as an equilibrium outcome. The model allows us to explore interesting issues related to economic policy and development, including the following questions. Does strengthening patent policy induce imitating economies to innovate? Does subsidizing innovation or imitation promote the industrialization of developing economies. If so, how does the inequality of the world economy change? We demonstrate that the answers to these important questions crucially depend on knowledge useful to imitative R&D.",2020,Business & Economics,0

A recently published and patented shock-absorbing system, namely, Uniaxial Graded Auxetic Damper (UGAD), proved its efficiency through comprehensive analytical and computational analyses. However, the authors highlighted the necessity for experimental testing of this new damper. Hence, this paper aimed to fabricate the UGAD using a cost-effective method and determine its load-deformation properties and energy-absorption potential experimentally and computationally. The geometry of the UGAD, fabrication technique, experimental setup, and computational model are presented. A series of dog-bone samples were tested to determine the exact properties of aluminium alloy (AW-5754, T-111). A simplified (elastic, plastic with strain hardening) material model was proposed and validated for use in future computational simulations. Results showed that deformation pattern, progressive collapse, and force-displacement relationships of the manufactured UGAD are in excellent agreement with the computational predictions, thus validating the proposed computational and material models.",2022,Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,0

Nevertheless, there exists notable disparity among studies concerning the implications of IPRs within developing countries. Therefore, this study examines how stronger IPRs affect economic activity and moderate two important knowledge channels, domestic and foreign innovation activity. Using a sample of 18 Latin American countries from 2007 to 2018, we employed the Driscoll-Kraay robust standard errors, two-stage least squares (2SLS), and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to examine the effects of IPRs. Results confirm an inverted U-shaped relationship between IPRs and economic activity. Hence, the majority of Latin countries continue to vary in the factors of production that suport robust IPRs. Conversely, robust IPRs effectively improve the relation between domestic innovation and economic activity. Similarly, this influence holds true for foreign innovation as well. Based on this evidence, the research suggests implementing an optimal IPR policy.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Increasing efficiency in vaccine Production: A primer for change,Research and development; Global health; Manufacturing; Second-generation vaccines; Vaccine access; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ACCESS,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of vaccines as public health and pandemic pre-paredness tools and amplified the importance of issues ranging from equitable distribution to reliable supply of quality, affordable vaccines. These issues however are not new. Delays in time from the first dose in a high-income country to introduction at scale in a low-income country can take years. These delays are driven by several challenges, some of which are unique to the vaccine development ecosystem. The patenting and overall intellectual property (IP) protection are complex, regulatory oversight is rigorous, manufacturing processes require technical support or know-how transfer from the innovator, and market dynamics create obstacles to delivering at scale. However, there are opportunities to accelerate the introduction of vaccines at scale in low and middle-income countries. To identify those opportunities, this paper provides an overview of the vaccine research and development process and where reform of the current system could increase access. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Drawing upon a network analysis of knowledge-based ties held by universities across the regions of the UK, it is found that those universities with the most central positions (network centrality) within university-industry network structures also have high rates of relational involvement in activities such as spin-off generation and engagement in externally funded research projects. Some forms of activity, in particular intellectual property protection through patenting, are found to be negatively associated with centrality. Spatial location is largely found to be unrelated to the network centrality of universities. By utilising network centrality as one measure of the open innovation capability of universities, the paper indicates that a range of institutional characteristics and factors tend to either promote or limit the engagement of universities in open innovation practices.",2020,Engineering; Business & Economics,0
How does stock market liberalization influence corporate innovation? Evidence from Stock Connect scheme in China,Corporate innovation; Stock market liberalization; Stock Connect scheme; FINANCIAL LIBERALIZATION; INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS; ANALYST COVERAGE; EMERGING MARKETS; FOREIGN; PROTECTION; GOVERNANCE,"Using China's Stock Connect program as a quasi-natural experiment, we assess the impact of stock market liberalization on corporate innovation. The baseline result based on a difference-indifferences (DID) estimation suggests that allowing foreign investors to buy domestic stocks has a beneficial effect on Chinese firms' innovative outputs. Specifically, eligible firms affected by the Stock Connect scheme generate more and higher quality patents than other unaffected firms subsequently. Furthermore, we explore potential channels that may explain this beneficial effect in terms of improving corporate governance, reducing information asymmetry, and mitigating financial constraints. In addition, the effect is more pronounced for firms in high-tech industries. However, we find that the influence of stock market liberalization is insignificant in state-owned firms. Besides, the findings are generally robust to different measures of innovation and different methods of estimation. Overall, this paper provides new insights into understanding the positive effect of stock market liberalization in emerging market economies.",2021,Business & Economics,0

Moreover, the model is calibrated to the US data to compare the growth and welfare implications of these subsidies. The main results are as follows. First, we analytically show that an optimal coordination of all instruments attains the first-best outcome. Second, in the calibrated economy, we numerically find that for the use of a single instrument, R&D subsidy is less growth-enhancing and welfare-improving than the other subsidies, whereas for the use of a mix of two instruments, subsidizing the production of final goods and the purchase of intermediate goods is most effective in promoting growth but least effective in raising welfare.",2023,Business & Economics,0

The empirical results suggest that promoting financial inclusion or R&D can offset the harmful effects of uncertainty on economic performance and that the impact of R&D with uncertainty is statistically significantly greater than the impact of financial inclusion with uncertainty. Moreover, our subsample analyses indicate that the mitigating effects of financial inclusion and R&D exist in nonfinancial crisis periods, developed countries, and the European region.

It elaborates on current welfare analyses of two-sector-R&D economies along two lines. First, it explores the welfare properties of non-drastic innovations whereas current analyses are confined to drastic innovations. It is shown that while the endogenously chosen size of drastic innovations is insufficient compared to social optimum, the size of non-drastic innovations may be excessive compared with the welfare maximizing one. Second, it explores welfare-enhancing policies designed to restrict innovators' market power, whereas current policy analyses focus on R&D and market-entry subsidies. The welfare-maximizing policies presented here combine proper limitations on innovators' market power along with a corresponding production tax (or subsidy). The limitations over innovators' market power are aimed to support the optimal innovation size, and the corresponding production tax is set to support the optimal product variety span.",2021,Business & Economics,0
THE VALUE IN SECRECY,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; TRADE SECRETS; LAW; INFORMATION; PROTECTION; KNOWLEDGE; ECONOMICS; COPYRIGHT; CONTRACT,"Trade secret law is seen as the most inclusive of intellectual property regimes. So long as information can be kept secret, the wisdom goes, it can be protected under trade secret law, even if patent and copyright protections are unavailable. But keeping it a secret does not magically transform information into a trade secret. The information must also derive economic value from being kept secret from others. This elusive statutory requirement-called independent economic value -might at first glance seem redundant, especially in the context of litigation. After all, if information had no value, why would the plaintiff have bothered to keep it secret, and why would the parties be arguing over the right to use or disclose it? Surely, well-kept secrets that end up in court must be valuable. That assumption is pervasive. But it is wrong. Secrecy does not demonstrate value. Even a company's best-kept secrets might be commercially worthless if vetted against what is known in the rest of the industry. Nor does the decision to pursue litigation indicate value. Trade secret litigants have plenty of exogenous reasons for pursuing lawsuits that have little to do with information's inherent value. Most importantly, value  is not the statutory standard; the standard is economic value that comes specifically from secrecy. Some federal courts have begun to call out weak assertions of independent economic value and, in the process, are redefining the role of this neglected statutory requirement.

The research work was performed as part of a project co-financed by the Intelligent Development Operational Programme 2014-2020, Measure 1.2,Sector R&D programmes managed by the National Centre for Research and Development in Warsaw. After performing key experimental work and obtaining promising research results, the project was completed in 2019 in accordance with the financing agreement. The performed research confirmed the feasibility of constructing a novel semi-technical production line for obtaining dendritic copper powders of different granulations at a production volume of 8 Mg/month. The powders are high quality market products and are obtained in a single process involving the conversion of cable waste, which is otherwise uneconomic to process in a recycling regime. The publication was prepared in accordance with the beneficiary's obligations regarding the dissemination of industrial research findings and in accordance with the agreement on development work co-financing. The research carried out indicates the technological possibilities of recycling difficult-to-recycle cable waste. The process makes it possible to obtain marketable products in a single waste-to-product operation, reconciles economy with environmental protection and meets the objectives of a Circular Economy.

Alcohols that are a by-product of sol-gel reactions influence the network formation, crosslinking density, and formulation stability, are volatile organic contents, and are regulated in the coatings industry. To improve environmental sustainability, a series of low-alcohol (LA) formulations with TG:ST ratios of 3:1 to 1:3 was prepared to investigate the microstructural development and crosslinking reactions emerging from the interplay of the hydrophobic thiol and polar epoxy silicates induced by the low-alcohol environment. The impact on crosslinking density was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman, XPS, viscosity, and pot-life measurements. Low-alcohol TGST (LA(TGST)) formulations were compared, using the example of 1:1 TGST, to corresponding TGST formulations where alcohols were retained.

Are intellectual property policies for gene-edited crops fit for purpose? The perspectives of German scientists,agricultural biotechnology; European Union science policy; gene editing; governance; intellectual property policies; PUBLIC TRUST; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; PATENTS; FOOD,"Societal Impact StatementA growing body of research indicates that intellectual property policies for agricultural biotechnologies are hindering research and limiting the use of the technologies. Research also indicates that public resistance to agricultural biotechnologies, including transgenic and gene-edited crops, is at least in part motivated by concerns about intellectual property restrictions. Therefore, changing the policies governing agricultural biotechnologies promises to reduce public resistance and to enhance the diffusion of research outputs. Because so many patents related to gene editing are held by universities and because so much cutting-edge research is conducted by public scientists, exploring the scientists' perspectives on these policies offers insights into possibilities for policy changes. After the European Court of Justice's ruling that gene-edited crops would be regulated the way transgenic crops are regulated, the European Commission consulted with stakeholders and concluded that policies governing gene-edited crops are not fit for purpose. This research explores whether public scientists in Germany also consider intellectual property policies not fit for purpose.The data come from intensive interviews with 10 scientists working at German universities and research institutes.The interviewed scientists describe how intellectual property policies limited the use of transgenic breeding techniques and how they now limit applications of gene-editing techniques. They overwhelmingly support policy changes that facilitate the use of their scientific breakthroughs to solve problems in the world, and they do not want to see large companies use the technologies to consolidate economic power or to profit at the expense of solving problems.Because intellectual property policies are often cited as a key reason for the resistance to agricultural biotechnologies and because research indicates that current policies are not enhancing crop innovations or social welfare, a change in intellectual property policies is likely to reduce resistance to the new crop breeding technologies and yield more social benefits.",2023,Biodiversity & Conservation; Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Stronger and more just? Recent reforms of China's intellectual property rights system and their implications,Intellectual property rights; China; Reform; Innovation; Technology transfer; ,"PurposeSince 2015, China has made efforts to reform its intellectual property rights (IPR) system to better protect and stimulate innovation. These reforms are a result of the demand for more stringent intellectual property (IP) protection from China's domestic, innovative industries and a measure to ease the pressure exerted by its foreign trading partners, particularly against the background of the US-China trade dispute that started at the beginning of 2018. This paper summarizes these reforms and their implications.Design/methodology/approachThis paper combines a variety of sources, including academic articles, government websites, news reports, industry surveys and expert opinions, to offer insights in China's IPR system and its recent reforms.FindingsThis paper summarizes and discusses (1) the state's law amendments, including the 2015 amendment of the Law on Promoting the Transformation of Scientific and Technological Achievements, the second amendment of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law with regard to trade secret protection, the fourth amendment of the Patent Law, and the legislations and regulations addressing the criticisms of the US administration over China's so-called forced technology transfer policies; (2) the establishment of the specialized IP courts and tribunals since 2014; (3) the restructuring of the State IP Office; and (4) the issuing of an Outline for Building an IPR Powerhouse (2021-2035).Originality/valueThis paper highlights China's efforts to make its IPR system stronger and more just.

Methods: We retrospectively assessed 84 consecutive patients who underwent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs between 2004 and 2016. The mean age of the patients was 57.3 years. We performed preoperative multidetector computed tomography in 74 patients (88.0%) to identify the Adamkiewicz artery. Spinal cord injury preventive measures included motor evoked potential monitoring, hypothermia induction, Adamkiewicz artery or other intercostal artery reconstruction, and cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Results: The hospital death rate was 5.9%, and paraplegia occurred in four patients (4.7%). The Adamkiewicz artery or other intercostal arteries were reconstructed selectively in 46 patients (54.7%). Of these patients, 41 underwent postoperative multidetector computed tomography, which revealed occlusion of the reconstructed grafts in 23 patients (56.0%). There was no paraplegia in the patients who underwent reconstruction of the Adamkiewicz artery, which was patent on postoperative multidetector computed tomography. Univariate analysis showed no significant effect of various risk factors on the development of spinal cord injury. Conclusion: Outcome of open surgery for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in our institution regarding spinal cord injury was satisfactory. The benefits of Adamkiewicz artery reconstruction remain inconclusive, and further larger studies are required to identify its validation for spinal cord protection in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.",2023,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Surgery,0
Bronchoscopy for diagnosis of COVID-19 with respiratory failure: A case report,COVID-19; Respiratory failure; Bronchoscopy; Diagnosis; Treatment; Case report; ,"BACKGROUND Although the imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are starting to be well determined, what actually occurs within the bronchi is poorly known. Here, we report the processes and findings of bronchoscopy in a patient with COVID-19 accompanied by respiratory failure. CASE SUMMARY A 65-year-old male patient was admitted to the Hainan General Hospital on February 3, 2020 for fever and shortness of breath for 13 d that worsened for the last 2 d. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid test was positive. Routine blood examination on February 28 showed a white blood cell count of 11.02 x 10(9)/L, 86.9% of neutrophils, 6.4% of lymphocytes, absolute lymphocyte count of 0.71 x 10(9)/L, procalcitonin of 2.260 ng/mL, and C-reactive protein of 142.61 mg/L. Oxygen saturation was 46% at baseline and turned to 94% after ventilation. The patient underwent video bronchoscopy. The tracheal cartilage ring was clear, and no deformity was found in the lumen. The trachea and bilateral bronchi were patent, while the mucosa was with slight hyperemia; no neoplasm or ulcer was found. Moderate amounts of white gelatinous secretions were found in the dorsal segment of the left inferior lobe, and the bronchial lumen was patent after sputum aspiration. The right inferior lobe was found with hyperemia and mucosal erosion, with white gelatinous secretion attachment. The patient's condition did not improve after the application of therapeutic bronchoscopy. CONCLUSION For patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure, bronchoscopy can be performed under mechanical ventilation to clarify the airway conditions. Protection should be worn during the process. Considering the risk of infection, it is not necessary to perform bronchoscopy in the mild to moderate COVID-19 patients.",2021,General & Internal Medicine,0

Suitability of IgG responses to multiple Plasmodium falciparum antigens as markers of transmission intensity and pattern,; MALARIA TRANSMISSION; ANTIBODY-RESPONSES; MEROZOITE ANTIGENS; CHILDREN; PROTECTION; INFECTION; HETEROGENEITY; SEROLOGY; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE,"Detection of antibody reactivity to appropriate, specific parasite antigens may constitute a sensitive and cost-effective alternative to current tools to monitor malaria transmission across different endemicity settings. This study aimed to determine the suitability of IgG responses to a number of P. falciparum antigens as markers of transmission intensity and pattern. Antibody responses to multiple malaria antigens were determined in 905 participants aged 1-12 years from three districts with low (Keta), medium (Hohoe) and high (Krachi) transmission intensity in the Volta region of Ghana. Blood film microscopy slides and dry blood spots (DBS) were obtained for parasitaemia detection and antibody measurement, respectively. Sera were eluted from DBS and levels of IgG specific for 10 malaria antigens determined by a multiplex assay. Results were compared within and among the districts. Total IgG responses to MSPDBL1, MSPDBLLeucine, MSP2-(FC27), RAMA, and PfRh2a and PfRh2b were higher in Krachi than in Hohoe and Keta. Seroprevalence of IgG specific for MSPDBLLeucine, RON4, and PfRh2b were also highest in Krachi. Responses to RALP-1, PfRh2a and PfRh2b were associated with patent but asymptomatic parasitaemia in Keta, while responses to MSPDBL1, MSPDBLLeucine, MSP2-(FC27), RAMA, Rh2-(2030), and PfRh2b were associated with parasite carriage in Hohoe, but not in Krachi. Using ROC analysis, only PfRh2b was found to predict patent, but asymptomatic, parasitaemia in Keta and Hohoe. Antibody breadth correlated positively with age (r = 0.29, p<0.0001) and parasitaemia (beta = 3.91; CI = 1.53 to 6.29), and medium to high transmission (p<0.0001). Our findings suggest differences in malaria-specific antibody responses across the three transmission zones and that PfRh2b has potential as a marker of malaria transmission intensity and pattern. This could have implications for malaria control programs and vaccine trials.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
IMPACT OF CHINA'S OFDI BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ON THE UPGRADE OF GREEN VALUE CHAINS IN COUNTRIES ALONG THE BELT AND ROAD,Global green value chain; sustainable development; foreign direct investment; green patent application; green technology spillover; SUPPLY CHAIN; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT,"Promoting the position of countries along the Belt and Road in the global green value chain is an important part of the construction of the Green Belt and Road. With the rapid growth of China's investment in countries along the Belt and Road, the pollution paradise effect of China's OFDI has also been exaggerated. In order to explore the relationship between China's OFDI and the rise of the global green value chain in the Belt and Road region, this paper constructs an indicator system and measures the position of 48 countries along the Belt and Road in the global green value chain. At the same time, the two-way fixed effects model and the panel threshold regression model are used to test the impact of China's OFDI on the rise of the green value chain of countries along the Belt and Road. The results show that China's rapidly growing number of green invention patent applications and OFDI based on the concept of environmentally sustainable development provide an important guarantee for China's OFDI's green technology spillover. China's OFDI has significantly promoted the rise of countries along the Belt and Road in the global green value chain, and China's OFDI has the threshold effect of institutional quality and human capital on the rise of the global green value chain of countries along the Belt and Road. When the quality of the host country's system crosses the threshold (6.7782) or the human capital index falls below the threshold (1.6615), the introduction of China's OFDI will be more conducive to the promotion of the global green value chain of the countries along the Belt and Road.",2020,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
"Incidence of atrial fibrillation in cryptogenic stroke with patent foramen ovale closure: protocol for the prospective, observational PFO-AF study",stroke; pacing & electrophysiology; telemedicine; MEDICAL THERAPY; ANTIPLATELET THERAPY; OUTCOMES,"Introduction After closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) due to stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in up to one in five patients. However, data are sparse regarding the possible pre-existence of AF in these patients prior to PFO closure, and about recurrence of AF in the long term after the procedure. No prospective study to date has investigated these topics in patients with implanted cardiac monitor (ICM). The PFO-AF study (registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under the number NCT04926142) will investigate the incidence of AF occurring within 2 months after percutaneous closure of PFO in patients with prior stroke. AF will be identified using systematic ICM. Secondary objectives are to assess incidence and burden of AF in the 2 months prior to, and up to 2 years after PFO closure.Methods and analysis Prospective, multicentre, observational study including 250 patients with an indication for PFO closure after stroke, as decided by interdisciplinary meetings with cardiologists and neurologists. Patients will undergo implantation of a Reveal Linq device (Medtronic). Percutaneous PFO closure will be performed 2 months after device implantation. Follow-up will include consultation, ECG and reading of ICM data at 2, 12 and 24 months after PFO closure. The primary endpoint is occurrence of AF at 2 months, defined as an episode of AF or atrial tachycardia/flutter lasting at least 30 s, and recorded by the ICM and/or any AF or atrial tachycardia/flutter documented on ECG during the first 2 months of follow-up.Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee 'Comite de Protection des Personnes (CPP) Sud-Mediterraneen III' on 2 June 2021 and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04926142).

Antitrust and Authorized Generics: A New Predation Analysis,; PRICE-COMPETITION; DRUGS; PRESCRIPTION; CONSUMERS; ENTRY; COST; ACT,"Much attention in the antitrust world has been focused on efforts by brand drug manufacturers to delay or deter generic entry into the pharmaceutical markets following these brand drugs' loss of patent exclusivity. Scholars have recounted and criticized recent exclusionary techniques by brand drug manufacturers, including pay-fordelay (or reverse-payment settlement) agreements, noncash pay-for-delay agreements, and product hopping. These efforts, while successful in stymieing generic entry into the prescription drug market, have largely been struck down by courts as anticompetitive in a series of recent decisions. In light of these decisions, a key, but underanalyzed, concern now is that in order to keep generics out of the market, or at least delay their entry, brand manufacturers will turn to a new tactic: predatory pricing using authorized generics. While some scholarly attention was paid to authorized generics in the early 2000s, almost none has been given since the Supreme Court held unlawful brand drug manufacturers' other main exclusionary tactics, despite the fact that the time is now ripe for the launch of authorized generics. Given that courts have already permitted a brand manufacturer's launch of an authorized generic during a first-filer generic's exclusivity period, brand manufacturers could deter generic entry by launching an authorized generic upon the start of the first filer's exclusivity period but pricing the authorized generic below the generic's costs, thereby preventing the generic from recouping its substantial entry costs. Eventually, if generics see a pattern of brands launching authorized generics during the first filer's period of exclusivity, generics may be deterred from entering the market at all before patent expiration, thereby depriving consumers of price competition in the pharmaceutical market, resulting in higher drug prices overall. The problem, however, is that if brand manufacturers are in fact pricing their authorized generics below the generic manufacturers' costs in order to deter generic entry, it is unduly difficult to hold the brand manufacturers accountable under the Supreme Court's current predatory pricing doctrine. Its test, as enunciated in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., only imposes liability if a predator prices below some measure of its own costs and if there is a reasonable probability that the predator will recoup its initial investment in low prices. This Note provides a new analysis that better accounts for the unique regulatory structure and patent protection of the prescription drug market. It argues that a test based on limit pricing, or pricing below the entrant's costs, would more effectively address this exclusionary conduct that harms consumers.",2020,Government & Law,0
Internally fire protected composite steel-concrete slim-floor beam,Steel-concrete composite beams; Fire resistance; Slim-floor beam; Electric furnace; Thermal experiments; Fire protection; Shallow floor beam; Integrated floor beam; RESISTANCE; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN,"The slim-floor beam is a composite concrete-steel beam fully integrated into the floor depth that was developed at the beginning of the 1990s. This composite beam presents a very good behaviour during the fire event because most of the steel parts of the section remain protected by the concrete encasement. Indeed, in a fire event, only the bottom surface of the lower steel plate results exposed to the heat source. The use of intumescent coating or other fireproof materials is the most common way to insulate the steel beam from fire but requires an accurate application and also appropriate maintenance during its whole life cycle to ensure proper fire protection. Thus, related to this last idea, the objective of this work is to present a new slim-floor configuration which increases the insulation of the beam from fire by using a design strategy that avoids the needed for maintenance. This new beam configuration has been called Internally Fire Protected Slim-Floor Beam (IFP-SFB) and implies a thermal break included within the beam cross-section. This paper presents the results of a series of thermal tests applied to this innovative slim-floor type proposed by the authors and its comparison against the most commonly used slim-floor configurations. Finally, the benefits of the proposed IFP-SFB configuration are presented, resulting in up to 30-60 min of additional fire resistance time. The IFP-SFB configuration is at present right-protected and under evaluation by the Spanish Office of Patents and Trademarks with reference number P201930438.",2021,Engineering,0

Nevertheless, overuse and persistence of these chemicals has negative effects on soil, water, and air, disrupting the food chain and the ecosystem. Recent advances in nanotechnology, particularly for the agriculture sector are being explored in crop production and protection with particular focus on nano-pesticides, nano-fertilizers, nanobiosensors, nano-devices as remediation strategies to deal with toxic effects of chemicals. The efficiency and fate of nanomaterials are heavily influenced by their properties and interactions with soil constituents. Chitosan (CH) and chitosan nanoparticles (CHNPs) are the remarkable due to their exceptional structural and functional properties including antimicrobial potential against several phytopathogens (feed, food, cereals, fibre, oil, industrial, medicinal, ornamental crops). CH and CHNPs can be applied individually and/or in combinations with other active components to manage plant diseases. This review highlights the role of CH and CHNPs in the defence mechanisms in plants and other promising agricultural applications. It also presents information on fungal chitosan (FCH) along with its promising functional properties over the CH of crustacean origin and strategies employed for the preparation of NPs-based (CHNPS or FCHNPs) formulations.

However, its active ingredients, targets of action, and potential mechanisms are still uncertain. Here, we investigate the role of DM as a prospective modulator of protection against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and illustrate the molecular mechanisms potentially involved. The network pharmacology and TMT-based quantitative protomics analysis were conducted to identify potential gene targets of the active ingredients in DM against NAFLD and T2DM. DM was administered to the mice of DM group for 4 weeks, and db/m mice (control group) and db/db mice (model group) were gavaged by normal saline. DM was also given to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and the serum was subjected to the palmitic acid-induced HepG2 cells with abnormal lipid metabolism. The mechanism of DM protection against T2DM-NAFLD is to improve liver function and pathological morphology by promoting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) activation, lowering blood glucose, improving insulin resistance (IR), and reducing inflammatory factors. In db/db mice, DM reduced RBG, body weight, and serum lipids levels, and significantly alleviated histological damage of liver steatosis and inflammation. It upregulated the PPAR gamma corresponding to the prediction from the bioinformatics analysis. DM significantly reduced inflammation by activating PPAR gamma in both db/db mice and palmitic acid-induced HepG2 cells.",2023,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

Increasing evidence has found oxidative stressto be the main risk factor for trabecular meshwork (TM) damage, leading to high-tension glaucoma. Topical anti-oxidants could represent a new target for glaucoma treatment. Our aim is to investigate the protective mechanisms on a human TM culture of a patented polyphenol and fatty acid (iTRAB(R))formulation in response to oxidative stress using an advanced invitromodel consisting of 3D-human TM cells, embedded in a natural hydrogel, and a milli-scaled multi-organ device model for constantdynamic conditions. The 3D-human TM cells(3D-HTMCs) were treated daily with 500 mu M H(2)O(2)or 500 mu M H(2)O(2)and 0.15% iTRAB(R)(m/v) for 72 h, and molecular differences in the intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS), state of the cells, activation of the apoptosis pathway and NF-kB and the expression ofinflammatory and fibrotic markers wereanalyzed at different time-points.Concomitant exposure significantly reduced iROS and restored TM viability, iTRAB(R) having a significant inhibitory effect on the apoptotic pathway, activation of NF-kappa B, induction of pro-inflammatory (IL-1 alpha, IL-1ss and TNF alpha) and pro-fibrotic (TGF beta) cytokines and the matrix metalloproteinase expressions. It is clear that this specific anti-oxidant provides a valid TM protection, suggesting iTRAB(R) could be an adjuvant therapy in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).",2020,General & Internal Medicine,0
"Development of an Innovative and Eco-Friendly UV Radiation Absorber, Based on Furan Moieties",sustainability; biodegradability; furane; UV filter; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; FILTERS; SUNSCREENS; CHEMISTRY,"The increasing concern about the environmental impact of ingredients largely used as sunscreens today is pushing research towards new frontiers for the synthesis and degradation potential of innovative sun protection structures. This study deals with the design, synthesis, efficacy evaluation, and environmental impact of new photo-stable molecules at extended electronic conjugation and which have the 'charge-transfer' type of optical transition (push and pull). They efficiently perform absorption of electro-magnetic radiation in the UVB and UVA regions. A preliminary screening, dealing with a whole series of aromatic donors, led to the selection of a key substrate derived from waste material, provided with low environmental impact and largely available on the market. As far as the acceptor was concerned, an ester with cyan-acrylic structure and functionalized with aliphatic chains emerged as the most suitable. This allowed a shift of the lambda of absorption in the range of the ultraviolet wavelengths. The synthesis procedures include an acid-catalyst-fitted esterification, condensation, and cold crystallization. It was continuously monitored with suitable characterization instruments (GC-MS, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR), in order to avoid by-products and parasitic reactions. The resulting structures (patent pending) are composed by a furan core condensed with cyano-acrylic esters, derivatized with branched chains of hydrocarbons of medium length. The obtained structures are capable of good absorption in the range of wavelengths between 300 and 400 nm. Because of their structures, the new molecules are largely soluble in many common oils and cosmetic ingredients. The new molecules have been successively evaluated in terms of photo-stability, biodegradability, compatibility, and UVB-UVA protection capability, both in-vivo and in-vitro, in comparison with existing sunscreens.",2020,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Dermatology,0

Achieving rapid intracranial revascularization and managing the extracranial lesion without complications are the main challenges. Materials and Methods: The balloon angioplasty followed by aspiration of large-vessel occlusion (BAFALO) technique was used to address this clinical issue. A review of a prospectively maintained stroke registry from January 2015 to April 2020 was performed. Patients had stroke with TO and treated with the BAFALO technique were included. Results: Twelve patients were enrolled: 11 had anterior circulation stroke, and 1 had posterior circulation stroke. There were 10 ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis/occlusion, one left common carotid artery to subclavian artery bypass stenosis, and 1 vertebral artery orifice stenosis. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16 (interquartile range [IQR]: 14-16). Revascularization with a Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b or more was achieved in 11 (92%) patients. The median puncture-to-revascularization time was 25 min (IQR: 19.5-31). Emergent stent implantation was performed in five (42%) patients. Three had distal protection devices (DPDs) with no distal embolization. Two patients did not use a DPD, and one had intracranial reocclusion. Eight (67%) proximal stenotic vessels remained patent. No symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred. Eight (67%) patients had favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Score 0-2 at 90 days). Conclusion: While managing TO, the BAFALO technique could achieve rapid intracranial revascularization and treat extracranial lesions under embolic protection. These merits translate into favorable clinical outcomes.",2022,Surgery,0
A FRAGILITY THEORY OF TRADEMARK FUNCTIONALITY,; BRAND; GOODS; CONSUMERS; MEDICATION; PREFERENCE; ANTITRUST; TASTE,"According to functionality doctrine, trademark protection cannot be granted for any feature that is essential to a product's use or purpose, or that affects the product's cost or quality. But because of the placebo effect, even seemingly inert names and symbols are imbued with precisely this kind of power. In fact, a wide variety of realworld phenomena challenge the prevailing understanding of trademark functionality, from the social uses of high-fashion marks to the cost reductions enabled by certification marks. More fundamentally, a valuable trademark of any kind should act to reduce search costs for consumers and improve quality through reputation. And yet, rather than leading to invalidation, all of these well-documented functionalities are apparently tolerated by trademark law-sometimes merely ignored, but often celebrated explicitly. This Article proposes a more unified theory of functionality: fragility. Some product features affect cost, quality, use, and purpose in ways that are non-fragilethe effects would persist even if every producer were to copy the same feature. But some features affect the product in ways that are fragile-the effects would be degraded or broken through unchecked copying. In reality, only non-fragile functionalities are actually prohibited, whereas fragile functionalities are permitted and even encouraged. In a manner surprisingly similar to patent or copyright law, trademark law appears to carefully distinguish between improvements that require its protection in order to manifest, and those that do not. This fragility theory not only better explains real-world case outcomes and the functionality doctrine's full history, but also offers a conceptual improvement that can be applied to all types of trademarks. A generic term, for example, exhibits non-fragile linguistic functionality. Moreover, fragility theory provides consistent answers to divisive boundary issues in trademark law, such as overlapping protection under copyright, anti-dilution rights, and post-sale confusion doctrine. At the same time, recognizing this fragility pattern calls attention to potentially adverse consequences in terms of distributive justice and market competition-consequences that trademark law itself may not be able to remedy.",2021,Government & Law,0

A meta-analysis has proven that RAO incidence in transradial coronary angiography (TRCA) settings was significantly higher than that in percutaneous coronary intervention settings. This prospective observational cohort aimed to evaluate radial artery protection after TRCA with different antiplatelet strategies. MethodsA total of 2,316 patients undergoing TRCA was enrolled and divided into two groups: single-antiplatelet and dual-antiplatelet groups. Radial artery patency was evaluated by ultrasound before, at 24 h, and 30 days after TRCA. The primary endpoint was RAO incidence at 30 days after TRCA. ResultsA total of 66 RAO was found on ultrasonography at 30-day follow-up (incidence: 2.8%). In the dual-antiplatelet group, the rate of RAO was significantly lower compared with the single-antiplatelet group (1.8 vs. 4.0%; odds ratio (OR): 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.70; p = 0.001). The rate of self-recanalization in the dual-antiplatelet group was significantly higher than that in the single-antiplatelet group (73.68 vs. 44.12%, p < 0.001). However, there was no statistical difference in delayed occlusion of radial artery between the two groups (0.5 vs. 0.2%, p = 0.140). Unexpectedly, this study also showed no significant difference in bleeding risk between the groups. ConclusionDual-antiplatelet therapy for 1 month after TRCA was associated with a reduced risk of RAO and deemed safe.",2022,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,0
Scenario analysis of hydrofluorocarbons consumption and emission reduction in China's mobile air-conditioning sector,Mobile air-conditioning; Gompertz model; Forecasting; Usage of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); Cost of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) abatement; ,"The automobile air conditioning industry is an important consumption area of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and the analysis of the use and emission reduction of HFCs in this industry is of great significance for environmental protection. This study aims to measure and analyze the HFC consumption and emission reduction in China's MAC industry and the cost of emission reduction in automobile enterprises through an in-depth analysis, to provide a scientific basis for the formulation of relevant policies and to support the country in achieving HFC emission reduction targets in the field of environmental protection. In this study, the Gompertz model combined with the vehicle survival rate Weibull was used to predict the vehicle ownership and sales in China, and then the HFC consumption and emission reduction in China's MAC industry and the cost of emission reduction in automobile enterprises were measured and analyzed with reference to the experience of relevant domestic and foreign measurement models. The results show that under the four scenarios of R27-X29, R29-X29, R29-X29, and R29-X35, the cumulative use of HFCs will be reduced by 61.44%-73.19%, and the cumulative emission will be reduced by 51.85%-64.55% in the period of 2023-2060, while the cumulative abatement cost of the automobile enterprises in the period of 2023-2060 will be RMB 419.31-481.02 billion. 481.02 billion yuan. The adoption of a policy banning HFCs refrigerants in M1 and N1 vehicles has a significant effect on reducing HFCs consumption and emissions, and the abatement cost will decrease with the expiration of new refrigerant patents, increased demand, and technological advancements.",2024,Energy & Fuels,0

This prototype is the result of our research in the field of energy (solar) roofs, ground heat storages, and active thermal protection. The client of the applied research, the owner of the prefabricated plant, has purchased the license for the patented ISOMAX system. Experience from the implementation of buildings according to this system shows the high potential using of RES but also the shortcomings caused by the variable, unstable, hardly predictable solar and geothermic energy stored in ground heat storages. The production of panels ISOMAX in the lost form from expanded polystyrene was too complicated, time-consuming, and often showed problems from a static point of view. Our research aimed to design an innovative, original, and reliable mode of operation for the IDA I. prefabricated house prototype under development, which in synergy with the building management system, will optimize the mode of operation of all heat/cooling sources and energy systems. Another task was to innovate the design of the envelope panel with active thermal protection, eliminate the shortcomings of the technical design of the ISOMAX panel, and adapt as many components as possible to prefabrication. The prototype of the energy-efficient prefabricated house IDA I. using RES represents an innovative energy-secure and self-sufficient construction option compared to buildings with fossil fuel-based heating/cooling sources.",2022,Engineering,0
Love of novelty: a source of innovation-based growth horizontal ellipsis or underdevelopment traps?,Cultural preferences; macro-based behavioral economics; innovation and growth cycles; endogenous growth; underdevelopment traps; E71; O40; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; CULTURE; CYCLES; POLICY; MODEL,"This study develops a new dynamic general equilibrium model to explore the role of people's love of novelty as a cultural preference in innovation and innovation-based growth. The model considers (a) an infinitely lived representative consumer who has standard love-of-variety preferences for differentiated products and additional love-of-novelty preferences for new products and (b) technological progress driven by two costly and time-consuming innovation activities, new product development and existing product development. We demonstrate that consumers' love of novelty is a source of innovation-based growth, wherein economies with a moderate love of novelty can achieve innovation and long-run growth through endogenous cycles between periods in which new product development is active and those in which existing product development is active. However, if love of novelty preference is too weak or too strong, the economy is caught in an underdevelopment trap with less innovation and no long-run growth. We also provide some suggestive empirical evidence that supports our theoretical predictions.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Evolution through intellectual property rights in the aquaculture sector: reshaping aquaculture production networks,Intellectual property; Aquaculture industry; Intellectual capital; Blue sustainability; Market size; UNIT-ROOT TESTS; OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; PANEL; COINTEGRATION; POWER,"In aquaculture, the intellectual property issues are the risks to the stability of copyright, trademark, patent, and other domains of intellectual property rights. As a basis of the intellectual property of marine law in the European Union region (EU27), the interests and needs of creators and the public are in balance. When such a balance is not upheld, then there is a compromise of the protection of intellectual property rights. Thus, the novelty can be formulated as follows: The analysis of the impact of the intellectual property factors on the aquaculture industry growth in the EU13 and EU14 during the 1990-2023 period. The main findings were estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), two-stage least squares (2SLS) and robust least square (RLS) to overcome the endogeneity problem. The degree of the impact reveals that the protection of IPRs and ICRs, that is, intellectual property rights and intellectual capital rights, significantly influence the growth of the aquaculture industry in the EU14 developed countries rather than in the EU13 developing countries. However, the actual values of the three estimators reveal that economic growth, market size, and governance significantly affect the aquaculture industry growth in EU13 developing countries than in EU14 developed countries. Therefore, according to the conclusions of this research, the policies that should be prioritized by the policymakers in EU13 developing countries are those that focus on the improvement of the development of intellectual property rights and intellectual capital rights plays. As it is suggested in this research, it is recommended that policymakers in EU14 developed countries enhance the blue governance, marine market size, and the development of aquatic economy and blue farming.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Does the import of green products encourage green technology innovation? Empirical evidence from China,Green product imports; Green technology innovation; Moderating effect; Green patents; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; CAPITAL GOODS; COMPETITION; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; FIRMS; SPILLOVERS; PROTECTION; QUALITY,"Green technology innovation capability is an important support for the realisation of Sustainable Development Goals, and it is of great significance to discuss the impact of green product imports on green technology innovation policy formulation in importing countries. Based on the panel data of 30 provincial-level regions in China from 2012 to 2020, this paper empirically examines the effect and mechanism of green product imports on green technology innovation. The empirical results show that (1) the import of green products significantly constrain China's green technology innovation. After a series of robustness tests and endogeneity tests, the conclusion is still valid, and the inhibitory effect is mainly manifested as the import technology dependence effect. (2) From the impact of green product imports on different types of green technology innovation, the inhibition effect of incremental-type green technology innovation with lower innovation is stronger than that of radical-type technology innovation with higher innovation. (3) Further test of the moderating effect shows that green R&D investment weakens the inhibitory effect of green product import in the regions with higher and lower economic development levels, while the moderating effect of intellectual property protection only exists in the regions with less economic development. (4) The heterogeneity analysis shows that the import of different types of green products has a significant difference in the impact of green technology innovation. The finding of this study provides useful suggestions for formulating reasonable policies for promoting and protecting green technology innovation.",2024,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0

Treating the target-based sulfur dioxide emissions control policy implemented for the Two Control Zones after 2000 as a quasi-natural experiment, we exploit the difference-in-difference approach to investigate the causal relationship between stringent environmental regulation and techno-logical innovation using the disaggregated Chinese manufacturing firm-level data between 1998 and 2007. Our estimation results indicate that the target-based environmental policy effectively limits the sulfur dioxide emissions of regulated enterprises and facilitates their technological innovation capability. The conclusion that strengthening environmental regulation has contributed to the technological innova-tion capability of enterprises is still robust after ruling out the effect of China's integration into the World Trade Organization. However, enterprises with different characteristics might respond heterogeneously to strict environmental regulation. The estimation results of the difference-in-difference-in-difference confirm that heavily polluting enterprises and those exposed to greater environmental protection pres-sure have experienced more technological progress. Further analyses demonstrate that enterprises' tech-nological innovation triggered by strict environmental regulation dramatically reduces their non-clean energy consumption and improves their environmental performance. Our research sheds light on the causal relationship between environmental regulation and technological innovation and provides crucial references for governments within developing economies to design scientific environmental policies aimed at searching for win-win solutions for economic growth and eco-environmental protection.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known, however, about how firms can rely on non-market factors to induce preferential treatment by host government authorities, thereby protecting their intellectual property overseas. In this paper, we investigate two such non-market factors, one at the country level, the other at the firm level, that are likely to influence the choice of where firms locate their innovation activities: host country inclination towards the firm's home country and the firm's political capabilities, respectively. We thus examine how IPR policies and non-market factors interact in protecting firm innovation from misappropriation and in making countries more attractive for innovation-related activities. We find support for our predictions in a sample of 1,341 foreign R&D investments made by 163 firms from 14 home countries over the period 2003-2016.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Transfer learning enables the molecular transformer to predict regio- and stereoselective reactions on carbohydrates,; LANGUAGE; MODEL,"Organic synthesis methodology enables the synthesis of complex molecules and materials used in all fields of science and technology and represents a vast body of accumulated knowledge optimally suited for deep learning. While most organic reactions involve distinct functional groups and can readily be learned by deep learning models and chemists alike, regio- and stereoselective transformations are more challenging because their outcome also depends on functional group surroundings. Here, we challenge the Molecular Transformer model to predict reactions on carbohydrates where regio- and stereoselectivity are notoriously difficult to predict. We show that transfer learning of the general patent reaction model with a small set of carbohydrate reactions produces a specialized model returning predictions for carbohydrate reactions with remarkable accuracy. We validate these predictions experimentally with the synthesis of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide involving regioselective protections and stereoselective glycosylations. The transfer learning approach should be applicable to any reaction class of interest. Organic reactions can readily be learned by deep learning models, however, stereochemistry is still a challenge. Here, the authors fine tune a general model using a small dataset, then predict and validate experimentally regio- and stereo-selectivity for various carbohydrates transformations.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0

Effect of media attention on corporate green technology innovation: mechanism and evidence from China,Media attention; Negative media coverage; Green technology innovation; Consumer choice pressure; M14; M21; O32; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE; IMPACT; CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; EFFICIENCY; COVERAGE; SLANT; BAD,"This study explores the effect of media attention on corporate green technology innovation. It uses the green patent application data of listed companies in China's heavy polluting industries between 2006 and 2020, with negative media coverage as a proxy variable for media attention, and employs a staggered difference-in-differences model. The results demonstrate that negative media coverage significantly and positively affects corporate green technology innovation. The mechanism analysis results show that negative media coverage drives green technology innovation through consumer purchasing choice pressure. The role of negative media coverage in promoting corporate green technology innovation is more apparent in regions with a high level of marketization and strong environmental protection intentions among residents. State-owned enterprises and those adopting proactive environmental strategies primarily manifest the positive impact of negative media coverage on green technology innovation. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the role of media attention on corporate governance by introducing green technology innovation and new insights for guiding policymakers and managers to effectively implement green innovation.",2024,Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,0
The impact of intellectual property protection on the performance of fossil fuel extraction and production companies in developing countries,Fossil fuels companies; Intellectual property; Fossil fuels expenses; Innovation efficiency; China; ,"This paper seeks to evaluate how intellectual property (IP) influences the sustainable performance of Chinese companies involved in fossil fuel exploration and production. The study meticulously delineates specific variables aimed at advancing sustainability through strategic IP measures. Utilizing data spanning from 2010 to 2021 and employing the Cross-Sectionally Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) approach, we reveal a nuanced relationship between innovation efficiency and energy costs. A mere 1% improvement in innovation efficiency corresponds to a 0.6% short-term and 0.4% long-term reduction in energy costs. Larger workforces contribute to increased energy consumption, investments drive energy-intensive processes, and profitability accelerates production, amplifying energy demands. Additionally, we uncover the adverse impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) expenses on energy costs, emphasizing the transformative potential of digitalization. To enhance sustainability, we recommend strengthening IP strategies, providing incentives for the commercialization of green patents, leveraging green financing, and adopting Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles to attract ethical investors.

The role of green technology innovation on employment: does industrial structure optimization and air quality matter?,Green technology innovation; Urban employment; Employment effect; Developing countries; Air quality; Industrial structure optimization; GROWTH; ENERGY; IMPACT; ENVIRONMENT; EFFICIENCY; POLLUTION; ECONOMY,"Although green technology innovation is an important means to balance the environment and economy, few studies have analyzed the employment effects of green technology innovation in developing countries. Therefore, this paper employs the panel data of 286 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2017 to empirically test the impact of various green technology innovations on urban employment. Meanwhile, from the perspectives of air quality and industrial structure optimization, the influencing mechanism of green technology innovation on employment is deeply analyzed. The results reveal that all kinds of green technology innovation can significantly increase the employment level of the city, and the promotion effect is strongest in the 2nd year after the patent application. According to the results of heterogeneity analysis, key cities of environmental protection and non-resource cities are more likely to generate positive employment effects through green technology innovation.

Place-based policy and green innovation: Evidence from the national pilot zone for ecological conservation in China,Place-based policy; National pilot zone for ecological conservation; Green innovation; China; Difference-in-differences; EMISSION,"This study examines the impact of the National Pilot Zone for Ecological Conservation (NPZEC) policy in China on green innovation (GI) using panel data from 282 Chinese cities during the period 2011-2019. Employing a difference-in-differences (DID) model, we find that the NPZEC policy positively influences GI, leading to a significant increase of approximately 23.98% in the number of green patents in cities where the policy is implemented. Mechanism tests reveal that the NPZEC policy enhances fiscal support and promotes economic agglomeration, thereby fostering GI. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that the NPZEC policy prioritizes quantity over quality, with a stronger impact observed in western cities, low administrative level cities, and cities with lower economic development. Additionally, our findings highlight that higher public environmental attention and stronger intellectual property (IP) protection enhance the promotion effect of the NPZEC policy on GI. Lastly, the findings indicate that the NPZEC policy has a negative impact on GI in neighboring cities.

Improving environmental awareness and developing green technologies are the key measures to solve the pollution problem. Combining the pollution emission database of Chinese industrial enterprises and the survey data on the scale of international talent inflow, we empirically test the impact of international talent influx on corporate pollution emission behavior and its influence channels. We have found that increasing the scale of international talent inflow significantly reduced the intensity of corporate pollution emissions, and the potential channels are to promote corporate technological progress, improvement of environmental protection concept, and export higher-quality products. Heterogeneity analysis found that the inflow of international talents has a significant inhibitory effect on the pollution emission intensity of enterprises in high human capital intensity and high pollution intensity industries, and talents from developed countries are more conducive to reducing the pollution emission intensity of enterprises.

ARPEC: A novel staggered perforated permeable caisson breakwater for wave absorption and harbour flushing,Perforated caisson breakwater; Physical modelling; Numerical modelling; Reflection coefficient; Transmission coefficient; RUBBLE-MOUND; QUAY-WALL; REFLECTION; GENERATION; EFFICIENCY; MODEL,"Perforated multichamber caisson breakwaters are widely used for deep water harbour protection from waves, causing a partial dissipation of wave energy, hence reducing wave reflection. The innovative patented geometry presented in this paper, the ARPEC, is an Anti Reflection PErmeable Caisson breakwater that allows a significant wave energy dissipation and a hydraulic connection between the sea side and the port side by means of a labyrinthine pattern of offset openings in all external and internal walls. The hydraulic response of this innovative structure is evaluated by means of both 2D physical and numerical models. It is shown that, when compared with traditional impermeable perforated caissons, the marginal increase of wave transmission (C-T = H-T/H-I in the approximate range of 0.1-0.2, varying with wave period) is compensated by a slight reduction of wave reflection (C-R = H-R /H-I in the approximate range of 0.3-0.6, varying with wave period) and by an enhanced water circulation in the sheltered basin, which is beneficial for flushing of microtidal harbours.",2021,Engineering,0

A New Method of Regulation of Loads Acting on the Shaft Lining in Sections Located in the Salt Rock Mass,mine shaft; salt rock; leaching; ,"Rock salt is characterized by specific geomechanical and rheological properties. Layers of rock salt at depths of over 900 m cause problems with shaft lining deformation. Methods of shaft lining protection used to date (e.g., in the Sieroszowice mine) have not been effective enough. The research presents a patented and copyright protected concept of a shaft lining construction that can be used in rock masses with strong rheological properties and susceptibility to leaching. A high value of convergence in salt rock mass is a reason for serious problems with shaft lining stability. Numerous trials have been done to provide appropriate shaft lining for salt layers, especially to ensure proper geometry of shaft members and conveyance guidance. In the new shaft lining concept, the excessive rock creep into the outbreak inside the shaft diameter is removed by local and controlled leaching of the shaft cheeks by means of fresh water through a porous medium at the contact layer behind the watertight tubing lining.

Value-Based Pricing for Patent-Protected Medicines Over the Product Life Cycle: Pricing Anomalies in the Age of Cures and Their Implications for Dynamic Efficiency,consumer surplus; cost-effectiveness analysis; cures; dynamic efficiency; genericization; social surplus; value-based pricing; COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; HEALTH; IMPACT; MECHANISM; PRICES; EUROPE; ENTRY,"Objectives: Conventional cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) for the value-based pricing of new medicines largely ignores the implications of limited market exclusivity (ie, patent-protection periods plus any exclusivity granted by regulators). This paper explores the implications of this methodological shortcoming, which produces several pricing anomalies with potentially unintended effects on research and development (R&D) incentives.Methods: We illustrate these implications by comparing 4 stylized examples of increasing complexity, from short-term cures for acute conditions to long-term cures for rare, health-catastrophic conditions.Results: (1) Conventional-CEA will project a different result than an adjusted CEA that considers generic or biosimilar entry; (2) free and flexible pricing of long-term treatments (eg, statins for hypercholesterolemia) or repeated-dose cures (eg, insulin for type 1 diabetes) for chronic conditions will likely result in predictable price increases at the end of the exclusivity period that may be perceived as unjustified or unsupported; and (3) one-time administration cures (eg, gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy) have the potential to allocate a large share of the social surplus to the manufacturer over the product lifetime, which may or may not be dynamically efficient per se, but may also inadvertently disadvantage the development of valuable long-term treatments or repeated-dose cures for chronic conditions.Conclusions: We highlight the need for additional research on long-term solutions to these issues that would aim to promote dynamically efficient global R&D. More work is needed on the following: (1) relationships between social surplus allocation and the amount and composition of global R&D, as we may be as likely to be encouraging excessive R&D in some areas as to be undersupplying it in others; and (2) relating the size of the surplus reward to R&D cost and, thus, the return on investment.",2023,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,0

We considered innovations directly received by countries from inventors seeking protection in their territories, and those embedded in processed food imports. Food and Agricultural Organization data were used to estimate the associations between international diffusion of food innovations and trends in total food supply and its macronutrient composition, after adjusting for confounding trends in demand-side factors. We identified the role of trade by simulating the changes in average diet due to innovations embedded in food imports.ResultsTrends in food innovations were positively and significantly associated with changes in daily per capita calorie supply available for human consumption in MIC between 1990 and 2010 (elasticity of 0.027, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.036). Food innovations were positively correlated with the share of animal and free fats in total food supply (elasticities of 0.044, 95% CI 0.030 to 0.058 for MIC between 1970 and 1989 and 0.023, 95% CI 0.003 to 0.043 for HIC between 1990 and 2010). Food innovations were associated with substitutions from complex carbohydrates towards sugars in total food supply for MIC after 1990 (elasticities of -0.037, 95% CI -0.045 to -0.029 for complex carbs, 0.082, 95% CI 0.066 to 0.098 for sugars). For these countries, the trade channel capturing access to innovations through imports of processed food played a key role.ConclusionPolicy-makers should consider the impacts of the international diffusion of food innovations in assessing the costs and benefits of international trade regulations.",2023,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0

As a unique industry, it is facing rare development opportunities in China and has broad market prospects. However, the characteristics of technical difficulty, loose organizational structure and uneven regional distribution limit the expansion of the nuclear power industry. This paper aims to a better understanding of the accumulation process for innovation capability from the perspective of network evolution and provides policy guidance for the market development of the nuclear power industry (NPI).Design/methodology/approachMethodologically, social network analysis is used to explore the co-evolution of multidimensional collaboration networks. First, the development and policy evolution of the NPI is introduced to divide the evolution periods. Then, the authors identify and analyze the core organizations, technologies and regions that promote nuclear power patent collaboration. Furthermore, three levels of collaboration networks based on organizations, technologies and regions are constructed to analyze the coevolution of patent networks in China's NPI.FindingsThe results show that nuclear power enterprises always play the foremost role in the organizational collaboration network (OCN), and the dominance of foreign enterprises is replaced by Chinese state-owned enterprises in the third period. The technology hotspot has shifted from nuclear power plant construction to the control system. The regional collaboration network was initially formed in the coastal areas and gradually moved inland, with Guangdong and Beijing becoming the two cores of the network. The scale of three collaboration networks is still expanding but the speed has slowed down.Originality/valueIn response to the pain points of the NPI, this research focuses on multidimensional collaborative innovation, investigates the dynamic evolution process of collaborative innovation networks in China's NPI and links policy evolution with network evolution creatively. The ultimate result not only helps nuclear power enterprises integrate innovative resources in complex environments but also promotes industrial upgrading and market development.",2024,Business & Economics,0

Two combined parameters contribute to an excellent normal tissue protection and an improved control of malignant tumors in small animal models, compared to conventional radiotherapy: dose deposition at a high dose rate and spatial fractionation at the micrometre level. The international microbeam research community expects to see clinical MRT trials within the next ten years. Physics-associated research is still widely regarded as a male domain. Thus, the question was asked whether this is reflected in the scientific contributions to the field of microbeam radiotherapy. Method A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Semantic Scholar and other sources to look specifically for female contributors to the field of microbeam radiotherapy development. Conclusion The original idea for MRT was patented in 1994 by an all-male research team. In approximately 50% of all publications related to microbeam radiotherapy, however, either the first or the senior author is a woman. The contribution of those women who have been driving the development of both technical and biomedical aspects of MRT in the last two decades is highlighted.",2022,"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Nuclear Science & Technology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",0

The study carried out in this paper allows us to analyze the influence that intangible knowledge has on the financial status of a start-up and, therefore, on its economic sustainability. This enables start-ups to present a good image, become more transparent, have more opportunities, reduce uncertainty, improve sustainability, etc. Moreover, the study presents a descriptive analysis of intangibles according to regions and activity sectors. An analysis of variance was carried out, to see if there is a relationship between the investment in intangible assets and the activity sector and/or regions to which the company belongs. The study concludes that, among all sectors, the differences in the incorporation of intangible assets into financial statements are most recognized in tourism, which may be a key factor for the sustainability of this sector, especially in periods of economic crisis, such as the one Europe and the planet are currently facing.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Overview of non-innovator biological products in India,Biosimilar; CDSCO; innovator reference biological product; non-innovator biological product; RCGM; ,"As per regulatory requirements, biosimilar drugs must show high similarity to their reference product in quality, preclinical and clinical tests. It is by these means that biosimilars are considered to be safe and efficacious. In India, any major deviation(s) from sciencebased principles in the manufacturing of a recombinant DNA-derived therapeutic biological product leads to its classification as a 'non-innovator' biological, which are approved as 'New Drugs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these biological products have uncertain safety and efficacy when compared to the reference biological and are therefore not recommended for use. However, these so-called non-innovator biological products continue to be developed in India, for reasons including brief and poorly implemented guidelines on biologicals, a lack of expertise on biosimilars amongst drug regulatory committees, lack of coordination among government departments working on biosimilars, poor quality accreditation in testing laboratories, and a lack of patent protection for innovator drugs. There is an urgent need to identify deficiencies in the ministries responsible for biosimilars in India, which could be through a scientific audit. Compliance with such an audit could strengthen the Indian regulatory system and thus increase the provision of affordable, high quality biosimilars in India.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
The Method of Measuring the Agglomeration Degree of High-Tech Industries and Its Influence Mechanism: Taking Guangdong Province as an Example,; GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION,"This paper selects the Herfindahl-Hirschman index and the Moran index to study the overall agglomeration and spatial distribution of high-tech industries in Guangdong, a province of China. The location entropy, dynamic agglomeration index, and output value share are also used in this study to measure the agglomeration and changes that occur in high-tech industries in various cities of Guangdong Province. The relevant data of high-tech industries for the province is collected between 2013 and 2018. Our results show that Guangdong Province's overall agglomeration of high-tech industries strengthened between 2013 and 2018, but industrial transfer occurred within the cities in the Pearl River Delta region to a certain extent. Regional international trade, R&D investment and patent output of the whole society, number of local scientific research personnel, economies of scale, communication level, and local taxation policies are the main factors contributing to the changes in the agglomeration of high-tech industries. Guangdong should create an open environment to increase R&D investment and expand the scale of R&D personnel and economy as well as strengthening intellectual property protection and communication level. Preferential taxation policies should be also implemented to accelerate the agglomeration of high-tech industries.",2021,Engineering; Mathematics,0
The use of intellectual property right bundles and firm performance in China,; AESTHETIC INNOVATION; TRADE SECRETS; PATENTS; EXPLORATION; PROTECTION,"Intellectual property rights (IPRs) have become increasingly important for firms in today's knowledge-based economy, as evidenced by the strong growth in their use. The vital role of IPRs has motivated research into their association with firm performance. However, few firm-level studies have been conducted in developing countries. Moreover, empirical studies on the use of IPR bundles and their economic performance are scarce. To fill this gap, this study first illuminates how the joint use of different IPRs varies with firm characteristics, second, it analyses the association of such joint use with firm performance, based on a constructed large dataset that merges firm-level information from China's Annual Survey of Industrial Enterprises with data on IPR filings from the China National Intellectual Property Administration. Results indicate that the joint use of different IPRs is strongly correlated with the industrial sector and firm size. Firms that use IPR bundles also have much greater economic performance than those that rely only on single types, indicating the existing complementarity between these rights. This study advances the understanding of the relationship between IPRs and firm performance and emphasises the complementary effect between different types of IPRs, demonstrating the significance of utilising various intellectual property mechanisms fully to increase firms' competitive advantages.",2023,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0
"The USDA-ARS National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Tree Fruit, Nut Crops, and Grapes, Davis, CA",Crop wild relatives; genebank; genetic resources; pomology; CENTERS; TRAITS,"The National Clonal Germplasm Repository Davis, CA (NCGR) curates the national collections of the following 14 Mediterranean fruit and nut crops: almond, apricot, cherry, fig, grape, kiwifruit, mulberry, olive, peach, persimmon, pistachio, plum, pomegranate, and walnut. The overarching goal is to preserve germplasm for current and future generations. The challenge is that these crops do not breed true and must therefore be maintained as plants in the field, making preservation of clonal crops considerably more expensive than annual crops that can be stored as seeds. The mission of the Repository is to acquire additional accessions to fill gaps in the collections, maintain the plants in the collections, freely distribute germplasm (typically as dormant scionwood) to scientists worldwide, and to evaluate the collections and make those data available online on the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN-Global,https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/search.aspx). Because of free distribution of the germplasm, there is nothing modern and under patent or proprietary protection in the collections. Rather, they consist of older cultivars; breeder lines; and the genetically richest portion of the collections, the crop wild relatives. All are available for scientific study. Challenges with managing an expanding collection are discussed.",2020,Agriculture,0
Energy-saving ventilation system for sheep premises to ensure food security and safety,food security and safety; underground heat exchanger; air duct; soil heat; CATTLE,"The impact of stress on an animal's physiological and behavioral state and the final meat quality has been extensively established. Prior to slaughter, animals are usually denied food and drink to reduce stomach content and minimize contamination from gut contents spilling from unintentional punctures to the gastrointestinal system during the eviscerating procedure. Feed withholding offers the benefit of lowering consumption of food as well as morbidity and death rates while in transit. Food restriction, on the other hand, triggers a stress reaction and causes animals to lose weight. In sheep farming, ventilation systems that functioned at temperatures above the threshold air temperature and relative humidity were very efficient and productive. The ventilation system proposed here works by using soil warmth, i.e., a renewable source of energy, and contributes to environmental protection. The results of theoretical and experimental studies of an energy-saving ventilation system using soil heat are presented. The use of an energy-saving ventilation system reduces energy and labor costs for creating a microclimate in sheep premises. The device of an energy-saving ventilation system is protected by the patent of RK KZ 26930 dated 15.07.2016.",2022,Food Science & Technology,0
Competition and Innovation in Markets with Technology Leaders,competition; innovating firms; non-innovating firms; R&D investments; welfare; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT; INDUSTRIAL-STRUCTURE; PATENT PROTECTION; COST REDUCTION; INCENTIVES; BERTRAND; COURNOT; PRODUCT; WELFARE,"In this article, we consider technology leaders (which are innovators) and technology followers (which are non-innovators) to provide a new theoretical explanation for the well-cited empirical evidence of an inverted-U relationship between competition and aggregate innovation. We consider a two-stage game with a deterministic Research and Development (R&D) process, where the leaders first determine their R&D investments simultaneously and then all leaders and followers determine their outputs simultaneously. We show that the inverted-U relationship between competition and aggregate innovation occurs if competition is affected by the number of technology followers. However, the presence of more technology leaders decreases individual R&D investments while increasing aggregate R&D investments. If the total number of firms remains the same but the composition of technology leaders and followers changes in favor of leaders (followers), individual R&D investments decrease (increase) but aggregate R&D investments increase (decrease). The relationship between competition and R&D investments can be U-shaped if the intensity of competition is measured by product substitutability. Contrary to the standard expectation, the presence of more firms may reduce welfare.",2022,Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,0
The Formal Agricultural Input Sector: A Missing Asset in Developing Nations?,supply chain; input sourcing; Haiti; agricultural development; input availability; MARKET DEVELOPMENT; AFRICA; ORGANIZATIONS; ADOPTION; IMPACT,"The formal input supply sector has received little attention in developing nations, including Haiti. We interviewed input store owners in Haiti and collected information on the availability and sources of inputs and challenges facing vendors. Three large suppliers import most inputs available to farmers. Second tier traders, mostly small stores that purchase from the major suppliers, play a critical role in making inputs accessible to rural communities. These formal stores have significant potential to transform the agricultural sector but face three major challenges. (1) Improved seed is a critically needed input, but older cultivars dominate because there is limited breeding in Haiti, few seed importers, and inadequate patent protections that make holders reluctant to move new varieties into Haiti. (2) The types of fertilizers and pesticides available to farmers are limited and many are technologically outdated. (3) In-country transportation is slow and relatively expensive and needed inputs often do not reach farmers in a timely manner. We conclude that approaches that bring together the strengths and assets of the public sector, the non-profit private sector and the for-profit private sector and increased attention to policy measures that benefit all three sectors are requisites for supply chain development in Haiti.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Although many determinants of GVC participation of enterprises have been discussed extensively in extant literature, the important influence of local institutional profile on GVC participation is often neglected. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of local institutional profile on GVC participation. Design/methodology/approach Taking the World Bank Enterprise Survey as the empirical sample, it is used an econometric method (propensity score matching technique) to test the relationship between local institutional profile and GVC participation. Findings Local institutional quality is positively related to GVC participation. Moreover, GVC participants display better innovation performance than non-participants. Innovation benefit from GVC participation is contingent upon the abilities of the participants, namely, absorptive capacity and research and development collaboration experience. GVC participants who only either export or import is compared with those who export and import; the findings show that the latter benefits more than the former. Originality/value This study offers researchers and practitioners a detailed view of local institutional profile and GVC participation.",2020,Business & Economics,0

Formal mechanisms protect this appropriability, such as patents or intellectual property (IP) rights. But not all countries respect IP rights and this phenomenon has increased in a complex way. There has been an academic interest in studying the trends regarding IP criminal activities. This study aims to identify the authors, universities and regions that publish the most in IP crime research worldwide. Using the Web of Science database, we analysed 589 articles published between 1991 and 2020 on the topic. The results indicate that approximately 75% of scientific production on IP Crime was written in the last decade, which is of great concern nowadays. The most influential authors come from the USA. This economy has stood out making progress in the establishment of formal mechanisms for the appropriation of innovation as a way to encourage more firms and innovators to develop new productive activities.

Sui-Genericide,; LANHAM ACT,"Generic terms-those that describe a general class of goods or services-are not eligible for trademark protection. Firms have historically gone to great lengths to prevent their trademarks from becoming generic-a fate often referred to as genericide. But in a few rare cases, firms have voluntarily declared certain terms that they have created to be generic, a phenomenon that I refer to as sui-genericide. This Article explores the little-discussed phenomenon of sui-genericide, both its origins in government-sponsored programs of the mid-twentieth century and its most recent incarnation in the area of technical interoperability standards. Though the voluntary relinquishment of the exclusive rights conferred by patents and copyrights has been studied extensively in the literature, there has been comparatively little scholarly attention to such mechanisms under trademark law. This Article examines the potential effects of sui-genericide on producer incentives, follow-on innovation and consumer welfare, and considers some of the ramifications of incorporating a sui-genericide doctrine into the law. It concludes by recommending potential measures to enhance the legal recognition of declarations of sui-genericide. These include official consideration during trademark prosecution of consensus lists of common terms that are developed by broadly-representative industry groups and the creation of a presumption of genericness for terms that appear on such lists, together with international harmonization of this recognition.",2021,Government & Law,0

However, there are various cases available reporting the fungal and mycotoxin contaminations. These HRMs after collection un-dergo severe extent of deterioration, leading to degradation of their active principles. Different chemical preservatives have been frequently used to protect HRMs from fungal and mycotoxin contamination, however, their indiscriminate use could lead to adverse effects on human health and environment due to residual toxicity. The use of essential oils (EOs) based formulations has been recommended as a green alternative of synthetic preservatives having greater safety profile and biodegradable nature. Nanoencapsulation maintains the stability of EOs and facilitate the controlled delivery with improvement in maintenance of bioactive principles of HRMs against fungal and mycotoxin mediated biodeterioration to boost pharmaceutical sectors. This review summarizes the pharmacological properties of some HRMs, the extent of degradation by fungal and mycotoxin contamination, preservation through nanoencapsulated EOs, mode of action, patenting of EOs as preservatives, and finally future opportunities to mitigate the associated problems.",2022,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0
Impacts of Environmental Agreements on Bilateral Trade of Climate Industry,climate change; technology; environmental agreements; gravity model; Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood; CURRENCY UNIONS; KYOTO; REGULATIONS; GRAVITY,"We investigated the effect of agreements related to climate change on bilateral trade, using the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) estimator on a large dataset that requires computing high-dimensional fixed effects. This study develops the concordance between commodities based on harmonized systems (HS) and technologies defined by both international and cooperative patent classifications (IPC/CPC). Using the OECD ENV-TECH classification, covering 169 exporting countries and 179 importing countries worldwide from 1991 to 2019, we determined the relationship between HS commodities and IPC/CPC climate change technologies. The main findings show that, first, the Kyoto Protocol has increased international bilateral trade in the climate change industry, while the Montreal Protocol has led to the opposite effect. In addition, the impact of environmental stringency on international bilateral trade in climate-related industries was negative and significant, refuting the Porter Hypothesis. This result was consistent within the trade between the convention countries. Therefore, national and industrial perspectives are relative, and voluntary climate mitigation methods should be applied, considering the areas where carbon reduction is relatively difficult. In other words, the conventions and policies must shift to a global paradigm in environmental protection and a more inclusive approach, with recognition of diversity in governance types.",2021,Energy & Fuels,0

In November 2018, the National Centralized Drug Procurement (NCDP) policy was published. The NCDP policy severs the interest relationship and significantly impacts on pharmaceutical enterprises's financial performance.MethodsUsing the implementation of China's National Centralized Drug Procurement (NCDP) policy as a quasi-natural experiment, this study evaluated the impact of participation in the NCDP policy on pharmaceutical enterprises' financial performance. We developed a difference-in-difference model to estimate the change in financial performance after NCDP implementation, based on financial data on Chinese listed pharmaceutical enterprises.ResultsWe found that the bid-winning enterprises' financial performance significantly improved after participating in NCDP. This may be related to lower costs, market share expansion, and increased research and development investment by the bid-winning enterprises.DiscussionTo further promote the high-quality development of pharmaceutical enterprises in China, the government should expand the variety of drugs on the NCDP list (NCDP drugs), while improving the drug patent protection system and the policies to support the bid-winning enterprises.",2023,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0
Does environmental information disclosure affect green innovation?,Environmental information disclosure (EID); Green innovation (GI); Digital transformation; Information asymmetry; POLITICAL CONNECTIONS; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; COST; PRODUCTIVITY,"Environmental information disclosure (EID) is a critical element of corporate disclosure that can demonstrate companies' dedication to environmental protection to stakeholders who are concerned about the environment. Using green patent data of Chinese listed companies, this paper tests the influence of EID on green innovation (GI) and the regulating role of digital transformation. Results show that EID has a positive impact on GI and that the relationship is significantly influenced by corporate digital transformation. Additionally, the moderating effect of digital transformation is more significant with high information opacity, financing dependence, and social attention. This study contributes to the literature on the perspective of firm-level voluntary information disclosure and proposes a more comprehensive logical analysis framework for the effect of EID on GI. Moreover, digital transformation can assist companies in identifying and disclosing environmental information more accurately, which increases the effectiveness of EID. Lastly, the findings emphasize the policy implications of utilizing digital technology for EID and the vital role of government regulation and guidance in EID. & COPY; 2023 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Does innovation capacity reduce tax evasion? Moderating effect of intellectual property rights,Tax evasion; Innovation capacity; Intellectual property rights; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY; FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS; PATENT PROTECTION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; MODELS; INVESTMENT; COUNTRIES; CREDITS,"The purpose of this study is two-fold: (i) investigate the association between innovation capacity and tax evasion; (ii) examine the moderating effect of intellectual property rights (IPR) on innovation capacity and tax evasion. Thus, the study provides policy guidance to reduce tax evasion. We collected data for 139 countries from several sources and merged them for the common period (2006-2015). The analytical tool (i.e., the linear mixed model methodology) enabled us to examine the topic under time-varying analysis. The fundamental results show that innovation capacity and IPR may be two significant mechanisms in alleviating tax evasion. We also found that IPR is a significant moderator between innovation capacity and tax evasion. However, this moderating effect is not homogeneous for all levels of innovation capacity-the moderating effect reduces and increases tax evasion at lower and higher levels, respectively. The Granger causality test confirmed the bidirectional relationship between innovation capacity and tax evasion. The robustness of the results was further confirmed by constructing two sub-samples-developed and developing countries. Finally, implications are suggested for policymaking to alleviate tax evasion behavior.",2021,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0
Tsunami Preparedness: Is Zero Casualties Possible?,Tsunami preparedness; Shelter-in-place; Tsunami vertical evacuation; Tsunami horizontal evacuation; VERTICAL EVACUATION BUILDINGS; EARTHQUAKE; MORTALITY; JAPAN,"Inspired by the goal of Kuroshio Town, a coastal community in southern Japan, to have zero casualties from the next tsunami, this study will focus on a tsunami preparedness program to save everyone's life. The first step in the program is to determine how many people in a tsunami hazard zone can be protected using existing horizontal and vertical evacuation procedures and shelters. The people who live or work in tsunami hazard zones but cannot or will not use these shelters are identified as unprotected. A possible solution to save the unprotected is to offer a shelter-in-place option to complement the horizontal and vertical evacuation options. Such a shelter-in-place option would provide protection for those unable or unwilling to use horizontal or vertical evacuation facilities. The shelter-in-place option would offer customized protection for individuals and businesses free of contagious diseases found in gatherings associated with horizontal or vertical evacuation shelters. To be effective, the shelter-in-place option must be immediately accessible to protect people from drowning, being crushed, being hit by floating objects, suffocation by ingesting silt laden water, fires, and hypothermia. An example of a shelter-in-place product is a patented, spherical aluminum capsule that floats on the tsunami protecting people from fire, cold water, being crushed, ingesting contaminated water, being hit by floating objects, and drowning. Since the capsule floats, there is no need to accurately predict tsunami flooding heights. This study includes numerical model simulations for 20 capsules subjected to 3 tsunami flooding scenarios in Newport, Oregon indicating the capsules have a low probability of being washed out to sea. Using a shelter-in-place option, along with horizontal and vertical evacuation options, zero casualties from the next tsunami is possible.",2023,Geochemistry & Geophysics,0

Laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) have shown promise as an efficient method of airway protection during anesthesia. Nineteen wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) lambs were immobilized using an IM combination of medetomidine (0.16 +/- 0.062 mg/kg), azaperone (0.20 +/- 0.058 mg/kg), and alfaxalone (0.54 +/- 0.21 mg/kg) via remote injection. Upon recumbency, arterial blood gas parameters, minute ventilation (V-E), tidal volume (V-T), and respiratory rate were measured before and after LMA placement. The V-E and V-T were measured via respirometer. Time to LMA placement, cuff pressure, cuff volume, and ease of placement were measured. Medetomidine was reversed with IM atipamezole at five times the medetomidine dose upon completion of procedures. Pre- and post-LMA measurements were compared using a t test or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test based on normality of the data. The LMA provided a patent airway in all lambs with a significant (P < 0.0001) increase in V-E (mean [95% CI]; pre-LMA: V-E = 17.3 [16.2-18.5] L/min, post-LMA: V-E = 19.8 [18.6-21.0] L/min) but did not have a significant impact on partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2; pre-LMA: corrected PaO2 = 45.2 [41.2-49.2] mm Hg, post-LMA: corrected PaO2 = 47.5 [43.3-51.7] mm Hg; P = 0.19) or partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2; pre-LMA: PaCO2 = 50.4 [46.6-53.2] mm Hg, post-LMA: PaCO2 = 51.6 [48.8-55.7] mm Hg; P = 0.035) following placement.

Electric vehicle has become a popular development trend in the automotive industry. This industry has a high degree of technological dependence. Electric vehicle technologies involve multiple disciplines, and study of the technology convergence among various disciplines can explain the interdisciplinary development in this field. Previous studies lack detailed estimation of promising and potential technology convergence relations as well as the detailed topics in this field. This paper combined qualitative and quantitative methods (e.g., network analysis, link prediction and text mining) and proposed a novel framework to explore promising and potential technology convergence relationships and topics in the field. The results are:(1) Eight promising relationships were found. For instance, the convergence relationship B60K-B60L is a promising example related to the convergence of dashboards or the mounting of one or more propulsion units and related devices and the propulsion, operation monitoring or electric safety in electric vehicles. (2) The topics of the five most promising ones are mainly about battery arrangement and protection, control systems, framework design, and charging connectors. Battery arrangement and protection are the most noteworthy promising topics. (3) Five potential convergence relationships are detected. For example, the convergence of propulsion, operation monitoring or electric safety in electric vehicles and image data processing or generation might occur in future innovation. (4) The potential topics might be electric vehicle condition display, compressor or pump electric control. The results could offer a reference to scientists, policy-makers and investors in the electric vehicle field, and the novel framework proposed in this paper could be applied to other technology fields to estimate the trends of technology convergence.

National and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) IP Policies: Comparison of Indian HEIs' IP Policies from a Global Perspective,Intellectual property policy; Innovation; Higher education institution; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; INNOVATION SYSTEM; UNIVERSITIES; PATENT; COMMERCIALIZATION; PROTECTION,"Until the end of the eighteenth century, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) were restricted to generate knowledge for free access to industries which they use for making commercial products. Though HEIs have the potential to contribute to the national economy from their creative and commercially viable R&D output through commercialization of research and Intellectual Property Rights, it was not given the needed importance due to lack of supportive policies. In many developed countries, innovation strategies, Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) and national Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policies provided opportunities to HEIs to own and commercialize knowledge they generate. National IPR policy and formulation and implementation of HEI IP policies became crucial for effective implementation, promotion of innovation, generation, and protection of IP in the HEIs. Efficiency of HEI in commercializing research is dependent on national IP policy framework aligning vision and goals of HEI IP policy with national IP policy, objectives, ownership, and revenue sharing mechanism. These are the key indicators for comparing the institutions' innovation and IP capacity. This paper uses these indicators to discuss the impact of different countries' (developed, developing, and least developed) national IPR policy frameworks on top-performing HEIs of those countries and to address the research question, how national and HEI IP policies have worked in achieving envisaged economic growth by improving innovation output of the HEIs. It further compares Indian HEI IP policies with global HEIs. We found that there is a greater need for local governments and HEIs to make their incentive strategies and policies in line with their corresponding national frameworks for facilitating the collaboration and commercialization of innovations. Implementing a robust IP policy framework at state/region and HEI level plays a pivotal role in creating an innovation ecosystem supportive to envisaged national economic growth.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Factors influencing the prioritisation of access to medicines in trade-related intellectual property policymaking in Thailand,compulsory licensing; flexibilities; patent; TRIPS; TRIPS-plus; ,"Thailand is facing ongoing trade-related challenges that threaten access to an affordable and sustainable supply of medicines. Despite Thailand's history of balancing trade pressures and public health priorities, little is known about the factors that enable or constrain a focus on access to medicines in trade-related intellectual property (IP) decision making. Using document analysis and qualitative interviews, and drawing on Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework, this qualitative study examines the factors that have enabled or constrained Thailand from focusing on access to medicines in three case studies of trade-related IP policy: Thailand's patent law and its amendments; its issuance of compulsory licences; and its decision-making about TRIPS-plus trade agreements including potential membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The degree to which access to medicines has been prioritised in Thailand's trade-related IP policymaking has varied across different types of policymaking and over time. Integral to its successes has been the involvement of the Ministry of Health and sustained advocacy by access to medicines coalitions which exert political pressure, generate evidence, and provide technical assistance to support evidence-based policy reform. In addition, Thailand's compulsory licencing was made possible by a policy entrepreneur with the motivation and authority to implement policy change. Constraints to Thailand's focus on access to medicines have included its trade dependence on the United States (US), ongoing US trade pressure to implement TRIPS-plus measures, and intense lobbying from Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the organisation representing US-based major pharmaceutical companies, to increase IP protection for pharmaceuticals in Thailand. Through the use of Kingdon's framework, this study's focus on three different types of trade-related IP policymaking has provided a detailed picture of the factors that have influenced the prioritisation of access to medicines and how these have played out in Thailand. Thailand's mixed history with regard to the prioritisation of access to medicines could provide lessons for other low- and middle-income countries facing similar challenges to access to medicines by ensuring that the conditions are right in each of the three streams for windows of opportunity to emerge.",2024,Government & Law,0
Catalytic capacity of technological innovation: Multidimensional definition and measurement from the perspective of knowledge spillover,Catalytic capacity of technological innovation; Knowledge spillover; Patentometrics; Multidimensional measurement; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT CITATION; INTERMEDIARIES; INDUSTRY; INVENTORS; AUTHORS; COLLABORATION; COUNTRIES; TALENT; CHAINS,"As participants of innovation activities, innovation catalysts play a crucial supporting role in enhancing innovation efficiency. Nevertheless, current studies focus more on the value of innovation catalysis, and take the subjective evaluation of the questionnaire survey as the core method, which is more suitable for individuals. Meanwhile, studies on the definition and measurement of catalytic capacity at the organizational level remain scarce. By analyzing the nature of knowledge spillover in innovation catalysis, this study proposes a twodimensional conceptual structure model of the catalytic capacity of technological innovation (CCTI) at the organizational level, namely the catalytic capacity of exogenous spillover (CCExS) and endogenous spillover (CCEnS). Then, based on the characteristics of patent cooperative applicants ranking and citation information, we construct a multidimensional measurement index system from two aspects, catalytic strength and breadth. In addition, 24 innovation catalysts from China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea were selected as samples to verify the validity of the measurement, through revealing and explaining the differences and characteristics of their CCTI. The results showed that (i) CCTI has a multidimensional structure, which can be measured from four aspects: degree, quality, geographical scope, and entity scope. (ii) Innovation catalysts showed certain capability preferences, either favoring CCExS (Samsung Electronics Company), or CCEnS (State Grid Corporation of China), or developing both (Toyota). (iii) Compared with company catalysts, whose catalytic capacity varied significantly with a broader distribution range, university and research institution catalysts' capacity was at a low level, but showed a relatively consistent level in each indicator. (iv) CCEnS of innovation catalysts in China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States decreased in order, while their CCExS ranked opposite. Besides, these characteristics of CCTI might result from different innovation strategies, innovation motivations, levels of technology development, and strengths of intellectual property protection. Overall, this study enriches and deepens the concept and measurement of CCTI at the organizational level, and the findings can provide a new viewpoint and method for the assessment and selection of innovation partners, catalytic capacity development direction, and ways and strategies for innovation cooperation.",2022,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0
Why 50?: 'industrial application' limitation in the Indian copyright-design interface,; ,"The current IP overlap in Indian copyright and design laws maintains that fine art aesthetics remain a province of copyright law and are strictly disjointed from protection afforded to utilitarian objects under design law. In practical application, however, Section 15 of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 serves as a point of partial cumulation. Section 15(2) creates a curious situation where the nature of the work could be determined not by its substantive subject-matter requirement but rather an arbitrary rule of more-than-50 articles of production. Section 15 remains an unrefined relic of the Imperial Copyright Act of 1914. The strong reactions against the repeal of Section 52 of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988 along with varied applications of the 50-article rule in other common law jurisdictions can be useful for the Delhi High Court in considering the ongoing constitutional challenge against Section 15(2). Differences in judicial opinions in a rather small pool of precedents have created significant scepticism in interpreting the precise scope of this 'industrial application' limitation. Repealing Section 15(2), despite its controversial status, would move the Indian copyright-design interface from partial to full cumulation-a result that does not sit well with the present legislative structure. Resolution of the issue requires the court to display sound conceptual deftness.",2024,Government & Law,0
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OF PMEL TSUNAMI RESEARCH PROTECTS POPULATIONS AND EXPANDS THE NEW BLUE ECONOMY,; ,"NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory's (PMEL's) approach to tsunami research is unique among such laboratories in that tsunami observations and modeling are under one roof, offering the advantages of enhancing the speed and lowering the cost of developments. Here, we chronicle the history of the transfer of deep-ocean observational and flooding modeling technologies within and outside of NOAA and provide a case study for future transfers. PMEL and partners' efforts in transferring tsunami technology have been very successful, resulting in improved protection of global communities with high tsunami risk while enhancing the new blue economy. The transfer of observational technology within NOAA required years of effort, while the transfer outside of NOAA only required a patent and license agreement. During the transfer process, three additional generations of observational technologies were created. The transfer of tsunami flooding modeling technology required a validation process for transfer into NOAA operations and an international training program to allow access to the technology by other countries. During this model development, a web-based product was created to simplify the use of and access to these models for both real-time and hazard assessment applications. We present lessons learned from these transfers, including the need for support as long as the technology is in use. The tsunami transfer process created a wealth of economic expansion while protecting coastal citizens from future tsunamis.",2023,Oceanography,0

To assess the incidence of no-reflow in patients undergoing chronic total occlusion [CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI), analyze possible causes and differential diagnoses, and identify useful management approaches. Methods. In this multicenter observational study, all CTO-PCIs performed between January 2018 and April 2019 were reviewed to collect no-reflow complications, defined as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow <= 1 in a patent epicardial artery. Patient clinical, anatomical, and procedural characteristics were analyzed. Results. Out of 461 PCIs, two (0.43%) were complicated by no-reflow. In 1 case, PCI was performed on a long segment of the right coronary artery, after use of a dissection-re-entry technique by knuckle wiring. In the second patient, no-reflow developed after proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenting, with a short subintimal tracking. Intravascular ultrasound was used to exclude complications in the epicardial vessel in both cases. Distal embolization seems the most plausible cause, and intracoronary adenosine effectively improved flow. Both patients had a type 4a myocardial infarction, asymptomatic in the first case, and associated with chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and new regional wall-motion abnormality at echocardiography in the second case. Conclusions. No-reflow in CTO recanalization is rare, but associated with a high risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction, with incomplete protection from ischemia offered by the pre-existing collateral network.",2020,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,0

Compared with pharmaceuticals that treat disease, however, preventative vaccines have received less attention from both biomedical researchers and innovation scholars. This neglect has substantial human and financial costs, as vividly illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the large number of missing vaccines is likely due to more than lack of scientific opportunities. Two key aspects of vaccines help account for their anemic development pipeline: (1) they are preventatives rather than treatments; and (2) they are generally durable goods with long-term effects rather than products purchased repeatedly. We explain how both aspects make vaccines less profitable than repeat-purchase treatments, even given comparable IP protection. We conclude by arguing that innovation policy should address these market distortions by experimenting with larger government-set rewards for vaccine production and use. Most modestly, policymakers should increase direct funding-including no grants and public-private partnerships-and insurance-based market subsidies for vaccine development. We also make the case for a large cash prize for any new vaccine made available at low or zero cost.",2020,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,0
ESG ratings and green innovation: A U-shaped journey towards sustainable development,ESG ratings; government subsidy; green innovation; sustainable development; CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; PROTECTION,"This study examines the relationship between corporate ESG ratings and green innovation based on data from Chinese A-share listed companies for the period between 2011 and 2022. The findings suggest a U- shaped relationship between ESG ratings and green innovation. Companies with lower ESG ratings (referred to as bad companies) tend to focus on improving their corporate governance and operational conditions, often at the expense of green innovation. However, as companies improve their ESG ratings, they increasingly view green innovation as a key growth area. This relationship is particularly evident in companies with low profitability and high operational risks. Additionally, we explore the impact of corporate ESG ratings on different types of green patents. The study finds that bad companies can mitigate the negative impact on green innovation through collaborative efforts, while non-inventive green innovations, they benefit from independent research and development. Furthermore, the study examines the role of government subsidies and executive compensation in influencing this relationship. The results show that government subsidies can both positively and negatively affect green innovation, depending on the company's operational status and ESG rating. The results provide valuable insights for companies, investors, and policymakers regarding the significant role of ESG scores in promoting green innovation and suggest strategies to enhance corporate sustainability performance.",2024,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Corrosion Assessment of a Weathering Steel Bridge Structure after 30 Years of Service,weathering steel; protective ability index; bridge inspection; ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION; PROTECTIVE ABILITY; CARBON-STEEL; RUST,"The first steel with improved resistance towards atmospheric corrosion, the so-called weathering steel, was patented in the USA in 1933 and was initially used for coal railway cars, and after that, in building and bridge engineering. Weathering steels show higher corrosion resistance than carbon steels in many types of atmosphere due to their ability to form a compact, stable, adherent and protective patina during the time of exposure. Morphological evaluation of the appearance of the corrosion product layer, together with phase analysis of its components, can enable determination of the type of patina and the degree of protection of the steel. To support the visual assessment of a patina, a check based on the qualitative and quantitative phase analysis of its components may be carried out, and the PAI (Protective Ability Index) can be calculated. The estimation of the corrosion processes on original Polish-made weathering steel (12HNNbA) was carried out on a 30-year-old bridge in Poland. There are some structural problems within the deck derived not only from corrosion but also steel cracking, both inside and outside the boxes, at different heights. Fourteen representative samples of patina were analysed and their phase structures were determined by the X-ray powder diffraction method. The PAIs were determined and analysed.",2021,Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,0

EPNs need an insect host to complete their life cycle, and they kill their host during its development. The major disadvantage of EPNs is the high cost of commercial products. Thus, there are many studies focused on reducing production costs by optimization of mass production. In a previous project, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar, 1976 (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae) HBH hybrid strain was developed from local isolates. This hybrid strain was patented due to superior bioecological characteristics. This study aimed to optimize in vitro solid mass production of hybrid strain. All laboratory trials were performed between 2017 and 2018, in Nematology Laboratory of Bursa Uludag University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant Protection. For optimization, additional supplementary ingredients (soy lecithin and egg yolk), temperature (24, 28 and 32 degrees C) and medium pH (5, 7 and 9) were selected as production parameters. Optimization was evaluated based on hermaphrodite egg numbers, total infective juveniles (IJs), IJ body length and IJ virulence. Based on results, best production combination was found as agar containing soy lecithin, 28 degrees C and pH 7. Also, agar media with pH 9 markedly reduced production yield. Consequently, optimum values for some important in vitro solid production parameters of HBH hybrid strain were determined.",2021,Entomology,0

In efforts to improve disease management in U.S. catfish aquaculture, a live-attenuated ESC vaccine and method of in-pond oral vaccine delivery was developed. This work evaluated the efficacy of the oral delivery platform using a live-attenuated E. ictaluri vaccine under simulated commercial conditions. Channel catfish fingerlings were orally vaccinated approximately 40-50 days poststocking by mixing the attenuated vaccine with feed using a patent-pending mechanized delivery system. Across three discrete years under varying evaluation methods, vaccination resulted in significant improvements in survival, feed conversion ratio, feed fed, and total yield. An economic analysis of experimental data suggests a significant positive net economic benefit from vaccination. After accounting for a projected cost of vaccination, the realized improvements in survival and yield resulted in an estimated benefit exceeding $3,500/ha ($1,400/acre) on fingerling operations. These results suggest vaccinating channel catfish fingerlings against ESC is an effective strategy to mitigate ESC-related losses and can significantly improve production efficiency and profitability on catfish operations.",2020,Fisheries,0
Beneficial effects of dissipative brackets on glazed façade maximum capacity under blast loading,Glazing capacity; Blast; Dissipative brackets; Connections; Sustainable design; GLASS WINDOWS; MITIGATION,"During the early 2000s, facade blast enhancement was characterized by heavy design, tempered thick glazing, rigid framing and massive connections to the building structure. The research undertaken in more recent years has shown that most part of the reinforcements was not required to match the protection targets. On the contrary, a dissipative strategy was incorporated, to analyse the fa & ccedil;ade element post-elastic behaviour, in order to use as much as possible their inherent energy absorbing properties and developing dynamic calculations with reduced conservative assumptions. It has been possible to supply a high degree of resilience also to buildings with less safety demand, but affected by significant blast risk (soft targets or indirect targets). The reduced incremental fa & ccedil;ade cost and the negligible impact on functionality and aesthetics, compared with the benefits in terms of financial loss reduction, have favoured a systematic approach in world areas affected by large terrorist threat. The deformable bracket patented by Permasteelisa has upgraded the dissipative effect, increasing the maximum blast the glazing can resist up to the failure and reducing the load transfer to the building, resulting in sustainable blast risk mitigation, not just for individual buildings, but as coordinated strategy in urban areas. This paper describes measurable cost and environmental benefits, showing different design solutions and experimental test validations of the dissipative brackets.",2024,Construction & Building Technology,0

We apply the structural gravity model to examine GMO trade between the United States and the countries that comprise the rest of the world. Our econometric method includes the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimator. We use panel data including measures of countries' IPR regimes, plant patentability, plant variety rights, GMO regulations and asynchronous approvals of GMOs. Results show the United States tends to export fewer GMO crops to countries with strong IPR regimes, plant patentability and plant variety rights. These results are consistent with the market power effect, where the United States restricts exports to countries with strong protections to extract monopoly prices. Second, enforcement of IPRs strengthens the market power effect. Third, the market power effect is strong alongside with GMO regulations and asynchronous approvals. Fourth, the market power effect is larger for self-pollinating crops vs. hybrids. These findings are robust across a variety of specifications. However, we also find a price premium in countries with less ease of US market access, with more domestic production of GMOs, and with weak traceability requirements. These features play a stronger role than IPRs in determining price.",2022,Business & Economics; International Relations,0
How does TRIPs compliance affect the economic growth of developing countries?

We examine both the strength of countries' IPRs, as well as their compliance with the 1995 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) of the World Trade Organization. Our theoretical framework is a growth model which distinguishes capital as physical capital, human capital and intellectual property. Our methods include panel regression techniques, plus a novel Synthetic Control method. The latter is valuable for examining policy effects in research situations where data are limited to small sample sizes; and where reverse causality and heterogeneity are concerns. The Synthetic Control method allows us to assess the impact of TRIPs compliance on economic growth relative to a counterfactual of what would have occurred in the absence of compliance. The results show that while select developing countries experience growth benefits from complying with the TRIPs agreement, others do not, supporting the notion that there is a wide range of heterogeneity in the effects of IPR reforms on growth. These findings are robust when we account for marginal institutional changes in IPRs, enforcement of IPRs, and technological capacity in developing countries.",2022,Business & Economics; International Relations,0
When income inequality reduction meets green transition: pay gap and green innovation in China,income inequality; green innovation; environmental regulations; financial resources; executives' backgrounds; CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FIRM INNOVATION; GOVERNANCE; INTENSITY; RESOURCE; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT,"While existing research at the national/regional and individual levels often emphasizes the compatibility between income inequality reduction and green transition, our study, based on the incentive alignment theory, argues that a certain level of pay gap can encourage executives to exert more management efforts on navigating the organizational change brought about by green innovation. Using a sample of Chinese public firms from 2012 to 2018, our empirical findings, based on ordinary least squares, the Heckman selection model and instrumental variable regression, demonstrate a positive impact of a pay gap on green innovation, particularly on green patents that require more management efforts due to the higher inventive step. Meanwhile, this positive effect is enhanced by executives with backgrounds in both R&D and environmental protection, as well as stronger regulatory pressures and financial resources. However, an excessive pay gap would limit the enthusiasm of employees with high bargaining power and a low sense of belonging to participate in green innovation. Our paper not only advances the understanding of how to promote green innovation, but also has significant practical implications for balancing green transition and pay equity in China and possibly in other countries where tradeoffs exist between these two domains.",2024,Development Studies; Public Administration,0

This tendency is generating an increase in the number of intellectual property (IP) registrations and is expanding the markets for IP. However, emerging economies tend to show unfair judicial systems, being unable to ensure IP rights protection, and to allow companies to benefit from their inventions. China is one of the most important emerging economies, and both domestic and foreign companies are investing a considerable amount of money in R&D and IP activities, especially in innovative cities such as Shenzhen. In this study, we aim to investigate whether the Chinese judicial system, using the city of Shenzhen as our empirical context, is fair in protecting IP rights. We use data about IP litigations from 2014 to 2016, targeting the three most relevant outcomes: settlement, judgment, and the amount of damage awards recognized by the court. The study shows no evidence that Shenzhen courts rule in favor of local firms, and the findings show consistency regarding settlement, the winning probability in judgment, and amount of damage awards. Accordingly, we derive managerial implications demonstrating that Shenzhen is a very international arena and firms act following the classic strategic theories of innovation appropriation.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Can New-Type Urbanization Promote Enterprise Green Technology Innovation?-A Study Based on Difference-in-Differences Model,new-type urbanization; green technology innovation; financing constraints; debt financing costs; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; ENERGY; POLLUTION; IMPACT; US; CONSUMPTION; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; INTENSITY; PRESSURE,"China proposed a new-type urbanization (NTU) strategy in 2012 to solve ecological and environmental problems caused by the traditional rapid and rough urbanization development model. Focusing on the policy's important goal of building green and smart cities, it is crucial to explore whether the pilot of NTU promotes green innovation at the enterprise level, and thus achieves green environmental protection. Based on data from 1717 Chinese listed companies' green patent applications between 2011 and 2020, this paper studies the impact effect of NTU on enterprises' green technology innovation utilizing the difference-in-difference model combined with the PSM-DID method. The findings indicate that: NTU has a substantial effect on enterprise innovation in green technologies. The mechanism analysis shows that NTU can encourage green technology innovation in enterprises by easing their financial restrictions. This requires the government to encourage enterprises to engage in green technology innovation by alleviating their financing constraints and reducing their debt financing costs through policy incentives and financial subsidies. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the impact of the policy on green innovation is more significant in the central and western regions, highly marketable areas, non-heavy-polluting industries, and among enterprises with higher levels of green innovation.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

In this study, a framework for identifying technological opportunities of cement kiln co-processing was proposed, where (1) scientific and technological keywords from papers and patents were extracted through the RAKE algorithm, and these keywords were divided into four clusters: effect, technology process, object of co-processing and pollutant; (2) the semantic similarities between the cluster science and technology fields were analyzed by calculating their cosine similarity of vectors to determine the technological opportunities, which combined with the occurrence time and frequency of the selected keywords. The results show that the cluster effect technologies have been almost developed.

Panel quantile methodology is applied to assess the relationship at several points of the conditional distribution of OFDI. Findings We provide novel and robust evidence revealing a highly negative relationship between OFDI and the strength of IP institutions in Europe. This relationship which is more pronounced in the median and upper-quantiles, bolsters the conventional theoretical expectation that high institutional distance between home and host countries is inversely related to OFDI. Equally important is the preliminary evidence of the non-linear impact of IP at the median and upper-quantiles as well as the impact of other controlling variables such as GDP, population, trade openness and unit labour costs on Chinese OFDI.

The effect of corporate real estate ownership on R&D innovation: credit relief vs. resource replacement in China,; INVESTMENT; MARKETS; CONSTRAINTS; COMPETITION; CAPACITY; ENTRY; DEBT; CASH,"Against the background of supply-side structural reform and the real estate financialisation in China, this study investigates the impact of real estate holdings on R&D investment using data of enterprises listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Our empirical results yield five main findings. First, enterprises holding more real estate assets face more serious financial constraints, thus restraining corporate innovation efficiency. Second, when the profit margin gap between entity enterprises and the real estate industry is larger, enterprises are more inclined to transfer industrial capital into the real estate industry, thus reducing R&D investment. Third, when the degree of marketisation is high, intensified market competition, the optimal allocation of factor and product markets, and stronger patent protection will weaken the restraining effect of corporate real estate holdings on R&D investment. Fourth, monopoly enterprises obtain potential profits more than undertaking risks from the real estate industry, they are more willing to hold real estate, thus strengthening the restraining effect of real estate holdings on innovation. Finally, investors' regional preference intensifies the restraining effect of corporate real estate holdings on R&D investment. Our empirical evidence can guide entity enterprises on how to effectively balance short-term (non-productive) and long-term (productive) capital investment.",2020,Business & Economics,0

Feasibility of hydrothermal liquefaction in phosphorus-recovery from wastewater sludges,Phosphorous recovery; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Leaching; Calcium phosphate precipitation; Product purity; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; STRUVITE; ENERGY; ASH,"A new process train is proposed to stabilize wastewater sludges and to recover calcium phosphate (CaP) from them via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The HTL process concentrates most of the P-content of wastewater sludges into a solid residue referred to as HTL-char. Acid leaching of HTL-char to elute P followed by a 3-step precipitation process is demonstrated for recovering high-quality CaP. Leaching HTL-char with 0.4 M HCl at a liquid:solid ratio of 20 for 0.5 h at 60.C enabled >99 % elution of P. The 3-step precipitation process resulted in 60-89 % recovery of the P-content of HTL-char as CaP, yielding 15-26 g of CaP/kg dry sludge. Yield of CaP could be increased further if the raw sludge mix is dewatered to increase its solid content to similar to 5 wt% prior to HTL. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer results confirmed that the 9 regulated heavy metals in the recovered CaP were below the limits defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Environmental Agency. Resource and energy costs associated with the proposed process are found to be comparable to those reported for the five patented processes for recovering P from anaerobically digested sludge (17.9 vs 21.2 +/- 12.7 (sic)/kg P recovered).",2023,Engineering; Water Resources,0

However, little attention has been paid to understand the influence of emerging digital financial inclusion (DFI) on China's GTFP growth. To address this research gap, this study employs the Malmquist-Luenberger index to measure the GTFP of 276 cities in China from 2011 to 2019, and then explores the impact of DFI on GTFP from the perspectives of innovation and entrepreneurship. The results show that the development of DFI significantly increases GTFP, which remains robust after variable replacement and endogenous treatment. At the micro-level, DFI is conductive to GTFP growth by promoting green innovation and entrepreneurial activity. Particularly, this study sheds light on the valid channel of green innovation patents in the relationship between DFI and GTFP whereas the mediating role of green utility models appears trivial. Heterogeneity analysis illustrates that the promotion effect of DFI on GTFP is more significant in the eastern area and non-resource-based cities. Therefore, in order to achieve sustainable development, the Chinese government should incorporate the development of DFI into the formulation of policies related to carbon mitigation.",2023,Engineering,0

The institution of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is a case in point, where various trade treaties have persuaded countries to homogenize the IPR laws, purportedly, to boost technological change and innovation. Such enthusiasm to homogenize the international policy space, however, is often at odds with the conjectures made by the scholars on institutions, who suggest that transfer of institutions across societies are burdened with problems of incompatibilities with other existing institutions, social values and historical, country-specific contingencies. Moreover, academic scholarship is divided on the relationship between IPR and innovations. This paper uses cross-country simultaneous equation estimations to analyze the two-way relationships between IPR, its underlying social values, historical-political contingencies, and innovation. Taking into consideration both technological and non-technological innovation, our results suggest that the impact of IPR on innovation dynamics of a country is neither one-way nor linear. Besides, various social values and historical contingencies seem to have a complex relationship with, and consequence on, the dynamics of innovation and IPR. The results suggest the need for interlinking development policies with the policies for innovations.",2021,Business & Economics,0

When the USA withdrew from this agreement, key intellectual property clauses relevant to pharmaceuticals were suspended. These could be reinstated should the CPTPP Parties decide to do so.Methods This study uses two scenarios to cost the impact the CPTPP would have had on Thailand's 2020 hepatitis C treatment regime if Thailand joined the CPTPP and suspended clauses were reinstated.Results Joining the CPTPP could have increased the cost more than tenfold if suspended CPTPP clauses were reinstated and Thailand was not willing or able to issue compulsory licenses. Based on the 2020 budget, the price for this possible scenario could have reduced hepatitis C treatment coverage by 90%.Conclusions Acceding to trade agreements such as the CPTPP that require increasing intellectual property protection, could compromise Thailand's hepatitis C program and other national treatment programs reliant on affordable generic medicines. The CPTPP could also prevent Thailand from relying on its own pharmaceutical capabilities to manufacture medicines needed to sustain its treatment programs.",2024,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0

The study applied econometric approaches such as panel vector autoregression (PVAR), PVAR Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response functions (IRF). We also applied heterogeneous and second-generation panel data approaches that are effervescent to slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependency to panel data revolving 20 countries (G20) and 27 developing countries from 2004 to 2022. To summarize the findings of this research, (1) the study discovered that economic growth, research and development, trademark, and government effectiveness have positive and significant effect on intellectual property right in the G20 countries. (2) Economic growth, trademark, and government effectiveness have positive and significant influence on intellectual property right, but research and development has no relationship with intellectual property right in the developing countries. (3) In the G20 countries, IPR responds favorably to economic growth, research and development, trademark, and government effectiveness shocks. (4) Lastly, IPR responds favorably to economic growth, trademark, and government effectiveness shocks in the developing countries. Our findings highlight the critical role that innovation-growth policies and economic development play as the primary global drivers of intellectual property rights.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Convergence analysis of regional sustainable innovation efficiency in China,Regional sustainable innovation efficiency; SBM model; Convergence; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PANEL-DATA; ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; CROSS-COUNTRY; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; PATENTS,"China's innovation development relies heavily on government and enterprises' large investments in R&D activities, but regional sustainable innovation efficiency (RSIE) remains low in most areas of China. The economic and social development in China is facing continuously strengthened constraints of energy and environment. Sustainable innovation is an efficient way to achieve green development of economy, energy and environment. Previous studies on innovation efficiency did not pay attention to the undesirable outputs and did not study the convergence of innovation efficiency. This research empirically evaluates the sustainable innovation efficiency on regional level based on a slack-based measurement (SBM) model considering energy consumption and environmental pollutions. Furthermore, this research analyses the convergence of regional sustainable innovation efficiency. Results show that sustainable innovation efficiency in central, western regions and the entire country is slowly increasing. Provinces with high levels of technological innovation and environmental protection, pollutant emissions reduction and energy consumption have higher sustainable innovation efficiency. In addition, obvious delta and absolute beta convergence trends exist in sustainable innovation efficiency, indicating that the regional differences among the three regions are shrinking. Regions with backward technological innovation are catching up with advanced regions. Controlled variables have a significant influence on the beta convergence, whereas the convergence factors in the eastern, central and western regions are different.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Optimization of Supercapacitor Assisted Surge Absorber (SCASA) Technique: A New Approach to Improve Surge Endurance Using Air-Gapped Ferrite Cores,supercapacitors; surge protection; magnetic permeance; air-gapped transformer; effective permeability; SCASA; ,"SCASA is a patented technique commercialized as a surge protector device (SPD) that adheres to UL-1449 test standards. Apart from the novel use of supercapacitors, SCASA design incorporates a coupled-inductor wound to a specially selected magnetic material of powdered-iron. In this study, we investigate the limitations of the present design under transient operation and elucidate ways to eliminate them with the use of air-gapped ferrite cores. In modelling the operation under 50 Hz AC and transient conditions, a permeance-based approach is used; in addition, non-ideal characteristics of the transformer core are emphasized and discussed with empirical validations. The experimental work was facilitated using a lightning surge simulator coupled with the 230 V AC utility mains; combinational surge-waveforms (6 kV/3 kA) defined by IEEE C62.41 standards were continuously injected into SPD prototypes during destructive testing. Such procedures substantiate the overall surge-endurance capabilities of the different core types under testing. With regard to optimizations, we validated a 95% depletion of a negative-surge effect that would otherwise pass to the load-end, and another 13-16% reduction of the clamping voltage verified the effectiveness of the methods undertaken. In conclusion, SCASA prototypes that utilized air-gapped cores revealed a greater surge endurance with improved load-end characteristics.",2021,Energy & Fuels,0

Germplasm of crop species, especially the wild species, contains genetic diversity that is critically important in meeting the challenges of food security and environmental concerns. However, natural genetic diversity is threatened by habitat loss from overpopulation, deforestation, mineral exploitation, wars, and development of dams and other large-scale projects like construction of roads, factories, canals, and housing. For example, new treaties, national legislation, border changes, protection of rights for future uses of germplasm, patent rights for proprietary developed germplasm, and quarantines and trade regulations all make access to and conservation of genetic resources less certain than in the past. Date palm is a naturally cross-pollinated fruit tree with a huge diversity starting from the Atlantic Ocean and ending at the Arabian Sea.

Paratuberculosis vaccination specific and non-specific effects on cattle lifespan,Paratuberculosis; Vaccine; Non-specific effects; Trained immunity; Cattle; Overall mortality; Killed vaccines; Mycobacteria; TRAINED IMMUNITY; TUBERCULIN REACTION; JOHNES-DISEASE; BCG; MORTALITY; VACCINES; PROTECTION; REDUCTION; INFECTION; MEASLES,"Records of cattle vaccination against paratuberculosis (PTB) have been analyzed to determine whether or not non-specific effect (NSE) on overall mortality similar to that observed in BCG vaccinated humans occurs in animals. The results of a previously reported slaughterhouse study on PTB prevalence were used as a reference on the age incidence of advanced patent (clinical) epidemio-pathogenic forms. In the proper vaccine study, cows in 30 cattle farms in the Basque Country, Spain were followed-up for between 1 and 13 years. Vaccinated groups were composed by 1008 (592 right-censored) animals younger than 3 months treated as calves and by 3761 (3160 right-censored) vaccinated at any older age. Controls were 339 (157 right-censored) and 4592 (2213 right-censored) age matched animals, respectively. Individual last year presence in the annual testing was considered age at culling or death. A survival analysis was carried out according age at vaccination of vaccinated versus non-vaccinated animals. PTB age incidence in the slaughterhouse study was subtracted from the difference between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals at the same age in order to estimate PTB-specific and non-specific effects. The maximum difference was observed at the 2-3 years interval with a 33.9% mortality reduction in the calf vaccinated group. This corresponded also with the maximum NSE that was 24.5% for a PTB incidence of 9.5%. Overall, vaccination afforded to calves a 26.5% yearly mortality protection, split between 11.1% PTB-specific and 15.4% NSE. These results support a NSE on total mortality associated with PTB vaccination that appeared to persist for up to 6-7 years. This confirms for the first time in an animal field study the innate immune system memory predicted by the recently proposed trained immunity theory. Contrasting the literature, no deleterious effects of killed vaccines on females were observed. Mortality reduction would offset vaccination costs and could improve livestock systems efficiency and potentially reduce antibiotic use. (C) 2021 The Authors.

"Parasagittal and Superior Sagittal Sinus Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas: Clinical Presentations, Imaging Characteristics, and Treatment Strategies",; BRIDGING VEINS,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Parasagittal and superior sagittal sinus (SSS) dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are often inappropriately classified. We explore the clinical presentations, imaging characteristics, and endovascular treatment strategies of these 2 DAVF subtypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and imaging data of 19 patients with SSS or parasagittal sinus DAVFs who underwent endovascular treatment in our institution between 2017 and 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The angiographic findings, endovascular treatment strategies, and angiographic outcomes were evaluated and recorded. RESULTS: Among these 19 patients, 14 had a parasagittal DAVF, 4 had a SSS DAVF, and 1 patient had both parasagittal and SSS DAVF. Only 1 (1/19, 5.26%) patient presented with intracranial hemorrhage. For the parasagittal DAVF group, most of the shunts were located along the middle third of the SSS (12/15, 80%), on the dura in proximity with the junctional zone between the bridging vein and SSS (15/15, 100%), with ipsilateral cortical venous reflux (CVR) (15/15, 100%). For the SSS DAVF group, all 5 patients had shunting zone along the middle third of the SSS, on the sinus or parasinus wall, with bilateral CVR. Transarterial embolization, via the middle meningeal artery as the primary route of access, was the primary treatment approach in 95% of cases (19/20). Reflux of embolization material into the SSS was observed in 1 case (1/5, 20%) of SSS DAVF in which balloon sinus protection was not used during embolization. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that parasagittal DAVFs have shunting point(s) centered on the junctional zone of the bridging vein and the SSS with ipsilateral CVR, while SSS DAVFs have shunting point(s) centered on the sinus or parasinus wall with bilateral CVR. Transarterial embolization via the middle meningeal artery can be used as the primary treatment strategy in most cases. Balloon sinus protection during embolization is not necessary in cases of parasagittal DAVF with occluded or stenosed connection with the SSS but its use should be considered in cases of SSS DAVF with patent sinus.",2024,"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",0
An intelligent content-based image retrieval methodology using transfer learning for digital IP protection,Convolutional neural network (CNN); Triplet neural network; Trademark (TM) infringement; Trademark management; content-based image retrieval (CBIR); FEATURES; SCALE,"Trademarks are used by companies to help customers identify products or services using images or logos in addition to slogans, words, names, sounds, smells, color, and motions. Trademark logos are widely distributed through advertising and published through online media websites and social networks such as Facebook, Pinterest, and Flicker. The intellectual property (IP) rights of the trademark owners have strong legal protection when registered with international intellectual property platforms such as the US Patent and Trademark Office and the World Intellectual Property Office. Using a registered trademark without prior consent of the owner may result in intellectual property infringement with severe legal consequences under civil or criminal law. Companies invest large capital resources in protecting their trademark from being copied or misused in ways that confuse the customers or steal market share. This research focuses on trademark (TM) logo image retrieval systems used in the cyber marketplaces to identify similar TM logo images online automatically and intelligently. The methodology developed for TM logo similarity measurement is based on content-based image retrieval. Content retrieval reduces the gap between high-level semantic interpretation of human vision and the low-level features processed by the machine. The proposed transfer learning methodology uses embedded learning with triplet loss to fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network model. The Logo-2K+ large-scale logo dataset is re-organized and divided into the top 70% as the training set and the remaining 30% as the testing set. The results show that the novel transfer learning approach is developed and demonstrated in this research for the intelligent automatic detection of similar TM logo images with high accuracy. The verification experiments (trained with 7625 logos and tested with 3221 logos) demonstrates that the Recall@10 of the test set can reach 95% using the advanced convolutional neural network model (VGG19) adjusted with the novel transfer learning methodology.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering,0

The occurrence of atherosclerosis is closely related to factors such as endothelial injury, lipid deposition, immunity, and inflammation. Conventional statins, currently used in atherosclerosis treatment, have numerous adverse side effects that limit their clinical utility, prompting the urgent need to identify safer and more effective therapeutic alternatives. Growing evidence indicates the significant potential of Chinese herbs in atherosclerosis treatment. Herbal monomer components, such as natural flavonoid compounds extracted from herbs like Coptis chinensis and Panax notoginseng, have been utilized for their lipid-lowering and inflammation-inhibiting effects in atherosclerosis treatment. These herbs can be used as single components in treating diseases and with other Chinese medicines to form herbal combinations. This approach targets the disease mechanism in multiple ways, enhancing the therapeutic effects. Thus, this review examines the roles of Chinese herbal medicine monomers and Chinese herbal compounds in inhibiting atherosclerosis, including regulating lipids, improving endothelial function, reducing oxidative stress, regulating inflammation and the immune response, and apoptosis. By highlighting these roles, our study offers new perspectives on atherosclerosis treatment with Chinese herbs and is anticipated to contribute to advancements in related research fields.",2024,Integrative & Complementary Medicine; General & Internal Medicine,0
The characteristics of intellectual property rights regimes: How formal and informal institutions affect outward FDI location,Economic rights; Intellectual property; Formal & informal institutions; Legal arrangements; FDI; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; TRANSACTION COSTS; DETERMINANTS; IMPACT; TRANSITION; ECONOMICS; DISTANCE; SYSTEMS; TRADE,This study examines the institutional arrangements that define the characteristics of national legal systems that are used to protect intellectual property (IP) assets embedded in outward FDI. The focus of the study is on how the institutional underpinnings of IPR regimes affect the costs and risk of using legal arenas to enable effective use of IP assets. Following a property rights approach it is postulated that formal and informal institutional arrangements influence how IP regimes affect the transaction costs and risk associated with converting ownership rights over IP into economic rights. Informal institutions are considered to affect the behaviour of agents involved in enforcing legal rights. This behaviour influences how IP law is implemented in legal arenas and thereby impacts on the efficacy of IPR regimes to help secure economic rights from the use of IP assets. Using data on outward FDI from the USA to 42 host countries the results find that the strength of informal institutions connected to the enforcement of IP in a country directly affects outcomes and positively moderates the effect of formal legal aspects of IP law on FDI flows. The results highlight the importance of informal institutional aspects connected to the behaviour of enforcement agents when using national legal systems to protect IP rights in cross frontier transactions.,2020,Business & Economics,0
Deletion of Interferon Lambda Receptor Elucidates Susceptibility to the Murine Model of Biliary Atresia,biliary atresia; interferon-lambda; type III interferon; rhesus rotavirus; cholangiocytes; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; MOUSE STRAINS; INFECTION; OBSTRUCTION,"Biliary atresia (BA) is a life-threatening cholangiopathy occurring in infancy, the most common indication for pediatric liver transplantation. The etiology of BA remains unknown; however, a viral etiology has been proposed as multiple viruses have been detected in explants of infants afflicted with BA. In the murine model of BA, Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) infection of newborn BALB/c pups results in a cholangiopathy that mirrors human BA. Infected BALB/c pups experience 100% symptomatology and mortality, while C57BL/6 mice are asymptomatic. Interferon-lambda (IFN-lambda) is an epithelial cytokine that provides protection against viral infection. We demonstrated that IFN-lambda is highly expressed in C57BL/6, leading to reduced RRV replication. RRV-infection of C57BL/6 IFN-lambda receptor knockout (C57BL/6 IFN-lambda R KO) pups resulted in 90% developing obstructive symptoms and 45% mortality with a higher viral titer in bile ducts and profound periportal inflammation compared to C57BL/6. Histology revealed complete biliary obstruction in symptomatic C57BL/6 IFN-lambda R KO pups, while C57BL/6 ducts were patent. These findings suggest that IFN-lambda is critical in preventing RRV replication. Deficiency in IFN-lambda permits RRV infection, which triggers the inflammatory cascade causing biliary obstruction. Further IFN-lambda study is warranted as it may play an important role in infant susceptibility to BA.",2023,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Immunology,0

It increasingly includes new business models, social aspects and technical matters for environmental protection. The paper investigates the modern outlooks of research and innovation that represent the ubiquity concerns of Europe facing global competition and striving to maintain its distinctive social model in line with sustainable development. The authors focused on an updated literature review on research and innovation for a sustainability transition. They analysed the political frameworks and strategic initiatives to support certain interventions for promoting the overarching role of innovation toward sustainable development. Through analysing secondary data provided by well-known innovation performance indicators (i.e. Global Innovation Index and European Innovation Scoreboard), different vulnerabilities of the local context (i.e. Romania country) were identified, and relevant improvement measures were emphasised to meet the agenda focused on a transition to sustainability. The findings made a structured contribution to the emerging field of research and innovation for sustainability transformation.

Based on the background of the talent war that has broken out between various cities in recent years, this study empirically verified the influence of the talent policy on urban innovation in 277 prefecture-level cities in China from 2010 to 2019 using the multi-period difference-in-differences model. The results indicated that the talent war caused by the talent policy has positively influenced urban innovation, causing, for instance, a dramatic increase in the number of patents for inventions. Among the subsidy methods of the talent war policy, the employment and entrepreneurship subsidy had the greatest incentive effect on urban innovation, followed by the talent housing subsidy. Moreover, the the talent war policy exerted a positive impact on urban innovation by improving the innovation willingness of cities and the level of talent gathering. At present, the talent war cities have, to a certain extent, restrained the improvement of urban innovation in neighboring cities because of the siphon effect, resulting in the division of the regional labor market. A heterogeneity analysis showed that the talent war has significantly promoted substantive innovation and the development of coastal cities with a better business environment and a higher degree of intellectual property protection.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

In this work, two different powders obtained from artichoke bracts and tomato by an innovative, non-thermal, and non-invasive technology (patent nr. 001,426,984) were added to the formulation of fresh Tagliatelle pasta. The fate of bioactive compounds before and after the cooking process was analyzed following the total polyphenolic content and the antioxidant activity. The addition of vegetable powders led to an increase in the above-mentioned parameters (110.0 mg of Gallic Acid/100 g pasta and 36.4 mu mol TEAC/100 g pasta for Artichoke-LP-Raw Pasta; 120.1 mg of Gallic Acid/100 g pasta and 55.3 mu mol TEAC/ 100 g pasta for Tomato-LP-Raw Pasta), and a mutual protection between polyphenolic compounds and proteins was observed, minimizing the bioactive compounds degradation along cooking process. The volatile organic fraction and the rate of starch digestion with related predicted glycaemic index were also investigated in fortified Tagliatelle samples, showing differences among them, demonstrating that the type of vegetable added characterized the aroma of both raw and cooked pasta.

Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Alone Does Not Guarantee Spinal Cord Protection After Complex Aortic Aneurysm Repair,Cerebrospinal fluid drainage; Cerebrospinal fluid pressure monitoring; FEVAR; Spinal cord ischaemia; Ventriculo-peritoneal shunt; ,"Introduction: Spinal cord ischaemia (SCI) is a devastating complication of the treatment of thoraco-abdominal aneurysms. Peri-operative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, typically using a spinal catheter, is a possible preventive measure. There are no reports or guidelines on peri-operative CSF drainage for this indication in patients with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Report: A single case of a patient suffering SCI after fenestrated endovascular aortic repair for the treatment of a pararenal aneurysm after previous open repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm is presented. Despite the presence of a patent VP shunt, elevated CSF pressures were observed after placement of a CSF drain. Discussion: A VP shunt with a gravitational component may drain insufficiently in bedridden patients who often lie with their head tilted on a cushion. In this position, both the differential pressure component and the gravitational component become active, thereby increasing the overall resistance to CSF outflow, hence increasing intracranial and intraspinal pressure. VP shunts with gravitational components should be managed with caution in the setting of prophylactic or therapeutic drainage of CSF to prevent SCI in extensive aortic repair. For reliable CSF pressure monitoring or active drainage in case of symptoms, the insertion of a spinal drain is indicated. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Methods: All published papers written in English were searched through PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar with the combination of relevant terms of COVID-19 vaccine inequity. Results: In this paper, we first outlined the scope of inequitable vaccine distribution and identify its truly cata-strophic consequences. Next, from the perspectives of political will, free markets, and profit-driven enterprises based on patent and intellectual property protection, we analyzed in depth the root causes of why this phe-nomenon is so difficult to combat. In addition, some specific and crucial solutions that should be undertaken in the long term were also put forward in order to provide a useful reference for the authorities, stakeholders, and researchers involved in addressing this worldwide crisis and the next one. Conclusions: Achieving COVID-19 vaccine equity faces funding gaps, vaccine nationalism, and barriers to access to intellectual property and technology. Thus, the scope of global vaccine inequity is immense, and its re-percussions will continue to be felt worldwide, especially among the world's most vulnerable residents, both adults and children.

Integrated Lab-Scale Process Combining Purification and PEGylation of L-Asparaginase from Zymomonas mobilis,; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; INTERFERON ALPHA-2A; EXPRESSION; CONTAMINATION; STABILITY; PROTEINS; CHILDREN,"During the last quarter of a century, PEGylation has been used to enhance the clinical effectiveness of various therapeutic proteins. However, the conjugation process significantly increases the costs of the process. This parameter is critical, especially for biosimilar products that do not have patent protection. The integration of protein purification to its conjugation could potentially reduce total costs. Following this hypothesis, in this work, the purification of L-asparaginase from Zymomonas mobilis, produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli, linked to its conjugation with a PEG of 12 kDa, was studied. The effect of operating parameters on cell rupture by high-pressure homogenization was analyzed, and the optimal values for the conditions in this study were determined. The chromatographic capture and final purification steps were also studied. It was possible to elute the protein from ion-exchange chromatography, used as final purification, in the optimal buffer for the PEGylation step. This result allowed us to eliminate the buffer change step that is usually carried out at the beginning of the PEGylation process. The conjugate obtained by this continuous process showed higher thermal stability and slower protein degradation compared to the native protein. This continuous process not only has great potential to reduce costs but could also be useful for studying the effect of different parameters on the overall performance of the process. This knowledge is especially important to establish a quality by design approach at the industrial scale.",2021,Engineering,0
Analysis of Various Factors' Influence and Optimization of Low-Temperature Combustion Technology,; FUEL; ENGINE; GAS; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; EMISSION,"It is possible to state that presently the transport area is responsible for a considerable part of the generated greenhouse gases and that transport is one of the main polluters in urban territories. However, at the same time, it is necessary to say that vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines are always the most popular among people thanks to the undoubted advantages of the piston combustion engines. Nowadays, several hundred millions of vehicles with combustion engines within the EU and about 1.5 milliard of such vehicles worldwide are utilized. The only reasonable possibility to reduce gaseous emissions generated by the motor car transport and to keep in operation vehicles equipped with the combustion engines is utilization of new fuels, namely, synthetic fuels. A very favorable idea is the innovative technology, which is called the low-temperature combustion (LTC). The LTC technology offers high efficiency of modern internal combustion engines together with the application of new climate-neutral fuels. That is why, the LTC technology means a prospective base for the sustainable future operation of the current vehicles. This scientific article describes the dual-fuel technology, namely, optimization of combustion and also a design proposal of innovated geometric shape of the combustion chamber determined for minimization of gaseous emissions.

The study draws the following conclusions: First, a mandatory CSR disclosure policy can promote the fulfillment of CER. Second, after the implementation of a mandatory CSR disclosure policy, enterprises can improve their CER level through two channels: improving the quality of environmental management disclosure and increasing the number of patents. Third, the heterogeneity of the impacts of mandatory CSR disclosure on CER is reflected in three aspects: different CER levels, different corporate scales and a different property rights structure. In terms of the CER level, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the CER level and mandatory CSR disclosure effect. In terms of the corporate scale, mandatory disclosure of CSR plays a greater role in large-scale enterprises. In terms of the structure of property rights, mandatory CSR disclosure has a greater effect on non-state-owned enterprises.",2021,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0
"Environmental Regulation and Green Technology Diffusion: A Case Study of Yangtze River Delta, China",environmental regulation; green technology diffusion; Yangtze River Delta; ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES; INNOVATION; INCENTIVES; PROTECTION; POLICIES,"As an important driver of green technology innovation, the impact of environmental regulation on the diffusion of green technology remains controversial. Taking China's Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration, as an example, and using green patents transfer to measure green technology diffusion, this paper analyzes the effect of environmental regulation on green technology diffusion by revealing the temporal and spatial characteristics of green technology diffusion in the YRD. The results show that: (1) Green technology transfer activities in the YRD mainly take place in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Suzhou, and other cities. (2) Green building technology is the most demanded technology in the green technology transfer market in the YRD. (3) The direction of green technology diffusion in the YRD has changed significantly over time. In the early stage, green technologies mainly flowed to developed cities such as Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing. However, in the later stage, green technologies mainly flowed from developed cities such as Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing to cities with lower economic development levels (mostly located in Anhui Province). (4) The consistency of environmental regulation among cities plays an important role in promoting green technology transfer within the YRD, which is precisely what the YRD ecological green integrated development strategy emphasizes, breaking the administrative barriers between cities in the YRD and accelerating the flow of green technology between cities.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Drying Process Modeling and Quality Assessments Regarding an Innovative Seed Dryer,seed drying; energy demand; released heat; mathematical modelling; quality assessments; CFD SIMULATION; BED; FLOW; DEHYDRATION,"The dehydration of agricultural products is a topic of research covering the preservation and conservation of the quality of agricultural and food items. The actual tasks of environmental protection include creating novel solutions to reduce the energy needs and exothermic consequences of the bulk of industrial processes. Due to the fact that air temperature and velocity in the seed layer are not uniform, the currently employed seed dryers have significant energy requirements and generate a lot of heat. A device that addresses this problem was developed and is now the subject of a patent application. The Coanda effect-based tronconic plates used in the dryer enable warm air to be dispersed uniformly throughout the product mass. Mathematical modeling was used for the design, operation, and optimization of the baffled drying unit. The investigations, which were conducted by modifying and observing the operational parameters (the velocity and temperature of the warm air) used four distinct types of seed with three different beginning moisture concentrations. Following the completion of the CFD simulation, the unit's design was created in SolidWorks. The seed and air humidity were measured using sensors, and the air speed was measured using an anemometer. The current lines and fields were used to express the speed and temperature results. The unit with deflectors reduced the amount of heat released by up to 15.38% and reduced the amount of energy used by up to 14%.",2023,Agriculture,0

Published data on waterproofing has provided conflicting and inaccurate information on crystalline-based technologies. Chem-Crete Pavix DCE is a patented, dual-crystalline waterproofing technology with performance characteristics which are materially distinct from other crystalline-based technologies. It combines hygroscopic crystallization, hydrophilic crystallization and hydrophobic characteristics. This publication presents the results of experimental research work on the significant characteristics of the dual-crystallization waterproofing technology as a treatment for existing or fully cured concrete. A program of laboratory testing has been completed in compliance with applicable ASTM and AASHTO standards using common concrete design mixes, in addition to cored specimens obtained from existing concrete pavements. The investigated experimental parameters included pore size, density, permeability, water absorption, resistance to cycles of freezing and thawing, chloride ion penetration, and mechanical properties of the surface, including pull-off strength, abrasion resistance and the coefficient of friction. Treated concrete has been found to have higher density, less voids, less surface area, and lower permeability than untreated specimens. These characteristics yielded significant reduction in water absorption, significant increase in resistance to damage from freezing and thawing and to biological attack, and significant reduction in chloride ion penetration, without negative impacts on mechanical properties.

Before the retrofit, ambient vibration tests were performed to evaluate frequencies and mode shapes for developing finite-element (f.e.) models describing the school dynamic behavior in operational conditions. Several finite-element models with increasing level of detail are presented, from the bare frame model, based on the assumptions and simplifications usually adopted for design purposes, to an upgraded model taking account of secondary and nonstructural elements (e.g., internal and external walls, screeds, roofing, floor tiles, and plasters) as well as the interaction between structure and retaining walls. The latter was used to develop the design model of the seismic retrofitting system, which aims to assure the immediate occupancy of the building in the case of severe earthquakes limiting damage to nonstructural components. Tests were repeated after the retrofit to check consistency with numerical design predictions. Comparisons between experimental and numerical modal parameters are shown discussing the usefulness of ambient vibration tests. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002865.

Optimization of combustion strategy for application of sustainable fuels regarding elimination of vehicles emission footprint,combustion strategy; sustainable fuels; vehicle; carbon neutrality; SIMULATION-MODEL; WAVE INFLUENCES; SYSTEM; REDUCTION; INLET,"Nowadays, transport generates a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time it is also one of the dominant polluters within urban agglomerations. However, vehicles with piston combustion engines are still the most popular choice of consumers thanks to the unquestionable advantages of these engines. There are currently several hundred million cars driven by combustion engines in EU-countries, and approximately one-and-a-half billion of worldwide. The only possible way to reduce the emission footprint of automotive transport while at the same time keeping the current fleet of combustion engine vehicles, is the application of synthetic fuels. Of course, hydrogen will have its place in the new green economy. A very promising idea is the low temperature combustion (LTC) technology. This technology combines the high efficiency of modern combustion engines with utilization of climate-neutral fuels. Therefore, the LTC technology can be a suitable solution for the sustainable future of the current vehicle fleet. The presented scientific article is focused on the development of dual-fuel technology, specifically on optimization of combustion conditions as well as on design of a new geometrical shape of the combustion chamber regarding minimization of engine emissions. This article also introduces a unique LTC system, which is characterized by significant achievements in reducing emissions.

Rethinking firm-specific advantages from intellectual property rights: Boundary conditions for MNEs,intellectual property rights (IPR); firm-specific advantages (FSAs); country-specific advantages (CSAs); multinational enterprises (MNEs); international business; CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; PATENT; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; PIRACY; CHINA; ENTRY,"We develop three sets of theoretical boundary conditions for the firm-specific advantages (FSA) and country-specific advantages (CSA) view of intellectual property rights (IPR) in international business. These conditions explain when and where MNEs' FSAs accrued from IPR assets (IPR-FSAs) are larger or smaller. In terms of IPR assets' structure, we explicate the conditions creating complementarity problems among MNEs' IPR that make IPR-FSAs larger, and the conditions under which complementarity problems between MNEs' IPR and closely related legal rights make IPR-FSAs smaller. In terms of IPR assets' geographic deployability, we explicate the rare conditions under which certain IPR-FSAs are non-location bound. However, we also explain that most IPR-FSAs are quasi-location-bound, and sometimes can even be fully location-bound, and therefore are smaller for MNEs' units abroad. In terms of IPR assets' defensibility, we explicate the conditions allowing IPR to still afford FSAs to MNEs even if the IPR cannot be favorably enforced. We argue that integrating these conditions into the FSA-CSA framework enables it to more precisely explain when and where there are heterogeneities in the size of MNEs' IPR-FSAs. We also explain how our work can facilitate the empirical study of IPR-FSAs in international business research and guide MNEs' IPR strategies.",2024,Business & Economics,0

The goal is to examine the evolving growth of ecological tourism and perform a spatial autocorrelation analysis. A social network analysis (SNA) model is utilized to assess both the overall and local characteristics of the TEE network. From a dual perspective, the influencing factors of provincial TEE in China are analyzed using a Tobit model, aiming to identify the equilibrium point between the economic development of tourism and environmental protection. According to the research findings, there was a high overall level of TEE in China from 2006 to 2019, and the development trend was positive. It was found that the distribution of the spatial autocorrelation network of TEE is out of equilibrium. In addition, provinces vary from each other, demonstrating a positive spatial connection, and the influence of clustering is notable. Environmental governance and the number of patents positively affect TEE, total energy consumption and environmental construction have no significant impact on TEE, and the tourism industry structure and financial expenditure have a negative impact on TEE.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

The reference drug is Vemlidy (R) 25 mg Film Tablet, which contains 25 mg of TAF in hemifumarate form, is under patent protection until 15.08.2032 by Gilead, and so the monofumarate form was used in the present study. At first, a pilot study was conducted involving 12 subjects under fed conditions. The results of the pilot study revealed the test and reference products were not bioequivalent, as a result of insufficient statistical power and high inter-subject variability. Secondly, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulation was performed based on the pilot study results and literature data. Finally, the power of the design was increased and the pivotal study design was optimized into a four-period, full-replicated, cross-over study with 34 subjects under fed conditions and it was concluded that the test and reference products were bioequivalent.

It enables the production of enantiopure drugs and enhances our understanding of the properties of chiral compounds. In this study, a straightforward and effective chiral detection strategy was developed for distinguishing between tryptophan (TRP) enantiomers. The approach involved the preparation of a magnetic molecularly imprinted chitosan (MMIC) for preparation of the sample, which was combined with a nitrocellulose membrane (a paper-based analytical device, PAD) integrated with D-TRP covalently grafted with polymethacrylic acid (PAD-PMA_D-TRP). Discriminating between the TRP enantiomers was achieved using AuNPs as a colorimetric probe. Indeed, the presence of D-TRP rapidly induced the aggregation of AuNPs due to its strong affinity to PAD-PMA_D-TRP, resulting in a noticeable change in the color of the AuNPs from red to purple. On the other hand, L-TRP did not induce any color changes. The chiral analysis could be easily performed with the naked eye and/or a smartphone. The developed method exhibited a detection limit of 3.3 mu M, and it was successfully applied to detect TRP in serum samples, demonstrating good recovery rates. The proposed procedure is characterized by its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, rapidity, and ease of operation.",2023,Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation,0
Contribution to the Research and Development of Innovative Building Components with Embedded Energy-Active Elements,active energy elements (EAE); active thermal protection (ATP); thermal barrier (TB); renewable energy sources (RES); heat/cold accumulation; SYSTEMS,"The research described in this study focuses on the innovation and optimization of building envelope panels with integrated energy-active elements in the thermal barrier function. It is closely related to developing and implementing the prototype prefabricated house IDA I with combined building-energy systems using renewable energy sources. We were inspired by the patented (R) ISOMAX panel and system, which we have been researching and innovating for a long time. The thermal barrier has the function of eliminating heat loss/gain through the building envelope. By controlling the heat/cold transfer in the thermal barrier, it is possible to eliminate the thickness of the thermal insulation of the building envelope and thus achieve an equivalent thermal resistance of the building structure that is equal to the standard required value. The technical solution of the ISOMAX panel also brings, besides the use of the thermal barrier function, the function of heat/cold accumulation in the load-bearing part of the building envelope. Our research aimed to design and develop a panel for which the construction would be optimal in terms of thermal barrier operation and heat/cold accumulation. As the production panels in the lost formwork of expanded polystyrene (according to the patented system) proved to be too complicated and time consuming, and often showed shortcomings from a structural point of view, the next goal was to design a new, statically reliable panel construction with integrated energy-active elements and a time-saving, cost-effective, unified production directly in the panel factory. In order to develop and design an innovative panel with integrated energy-active elements, we analyzed the composition of the original panel and designed the composition of the innovative panel. We created mathematical-physical models of both panels and analyzed their energy potential. By induction and an analog form of formation, we designed the innovative panel. Based on the synthesis of the knowledge obtained from the scientific analysis and the transformation of this data, most of the building components and all the panels with integrated energy-active elements were manufactured directly in the prefabrication plant. Subsequently, the prototype of the prefabricated house IDA I was realized. The novelty of our innovative building envelope panel solution lies in the panel's design, which has a heat loss/gain that is 2.6 times lower compared to the ISOMAX panel.",2022,Materials Science; Physics,0
Biotechnology and Intellectual Property Law: Theoretical and Practical Reflections on Albanian National Law and Jurisprudence in Comparison with EU Acquis and ECJ Case Law,biotechnology; intellectual property rights; EU acquis; Albanian legislation; legal approximation; ,"Biotechnology is a fast-emerging sector with enormous commercial and scientific development potential. It is impossible to overstate the prominence of intellectual property (IP) in securing and fostering innovation in the biotechnology sector. Albania, as a candidate country for EU membership, has made significant efforts to align its legislation with the EU acquis, including in the field of biotechnology and IP. The ambit of biotechnology and intellectual property laws in Albania includes patent law, trade secrets, and plant variety rights. In general, Albania's law is mostly aligned with the EU acquis, while there are a few areas that need additional development. For instance, further work is needed to define the perquisites for patentability and expand the scope of protection afforded to biotechnological innovations in Albania. There have not been many high-stakes court decisions in Albania concerning biotechnology and intellectual property, hence the country's case law is still evolving. In comparison to the EU, Albanian laws and case law in the fields of biotechnology and intellectual property are still in their infancy. Nonetheless, Albania has made substantial progress in aligning its legislation with the EU acquis, and its judges are becoming more conversant with EU case law. Albania's legislation and case law in this field is projected to continue converging with those of the EU as the country draws closer to EU membership, which will assist to encourage innovation and economic development in Albania.",2023,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0
Does piracy lead to product abandonment or stimulate new product development?: Evidence from mobileplatform-baseddeveloper firms,digital innovation; digital piracy; mobile applications; new product development; platforms; COPYRIGHT PROTECTION; SALES DISPLACEMENT; SOFTWARE PIRACY; ONLINE PIRACY; INNOVATION; PATENTS; MUSIC; ENTRY; WELFARE; IMPACT,"Research Summary With the growth of digital platforms, understanding the role of property rights on those platforms has become increasingly important. Digital piracy, the unauthorized copying and distribution of digital products, is therefore an important strategic issue, both because of lost revenues and because it is thought to decrease innovation. Yet, while the latter effect is often argued, empirical evidence is limited. We study whether piracy affects innovation and whether it leads firms to shift to different types of innovations. By studying a large piracy event in a mobile app marketplace, we find that piracy leads to a decrease in the release of incremental innovations, such as bug fixes, but does not decrease more substantial revisions. Additionally, it is associated with subsequent new product development. Managerial For many platform companies, a critical issue is understanding how piracy and imitation should be regulated, motivated in part by a common narrative that piracy will eliminate innovation on these platforms. The present article suggests that these effects are slightly more nuanced. We find that piracy does lead to a decline in incremental innovations, such as bug fixes or appearance tweaks, but no discernible decline in more major innovations, such as feature updates or entirely new versions. This implies that piracy can shape the type of innovation, potentially leading to products that are less polished and refined but not affecting the overall level of innovation.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Sildenafil and suicide in Sweden,Sildenafil; Sexual intimacy; Suicide; ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION; SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; LIFE; SATISFACTION; DEPRESSION; HAPPINESS; PATTERNS; HEALTH; DEATH,"Much theory asserts that sexual intimacy sustains mental health. Experimental tests of such theory remain rare and have not provided compelling evidence because ethical, practical, and cultural constraints bias samples and results. An epidemiologic approach would, therefore, seem indicated given the rigor the discipline brings to quasi-experimental research. For reasons that remain unclear, however, epidemiologist have largely ignored such theory despite the plausibility of the processes implicated, which engender, for example, happiness, feelings of belonging and self-worth, and protection against depression. We use an intent-to-treat design, implemented via interrupted time-series methods, to test the hypothesis that the monthly incidence of suicide, a societally important distal measure of mental health in a population, decreased among Swedish men aged 50-59 after July 2013 when patent rights to sildenafil (i.e., Viagra) ceased, prices fell, and its use increased dramatically. The test uses 102 pre, and 18 post, price-drop months. 65 fewer suicides than expected occurred among men aged 50-59 over test months following the lowering of sildenafil prices. Our findings could not arise from shared trends or seasonality, biased samples, or reverse causation. Our results would appear by chance fewer than once in 10,000 experiments. Our findings align with theory indicating that sexual intimacy reinforces mental health. Using suicide as our distal measure of mental health further implies that public health programming intended to address the drivers of self-destructive behavior should reduce barriers to intimacy in the middle-aged populations.",2021,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0
Effect of the factors affecting high-performance p-aramid fibre dyeing and their optimization,Bursting strength; Exhaust dyeing; P-aramid fibres; UV stability; UV-PROTECTIVE TEXTILES,"Purpose This study aims to evaluate the dyeing of the p-aramid fibre with cationic dyes and investigate the effect of dyeing in the protection of the fibre from ultraviolet (UV) light. Design/methodology/approach P-aramid fabric has been dyed with cationic dyes using benzyl alcohol as swelling agent to promote the penetration of dye molecules into the fibre. The fabrics were evaluated against colour strength (K/S) value and colour fastness properties after dyed with cationic dyes using full factorial design. This design was used to study the effect of factors that affect the response variables as well as to study the interactions among the factors on response variable. The bursting strength, scanning electron microscopy analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis of undyed and dyed p-aramid fabric were performed before and after exposure to UV light to investigate the changes in mechanical behaviour. Findings The results show that the p-aramid fabric dyed with cationic dyes has good K/S values and good fastness properties. The exposure of undyed p-aramid fabric to UV light causes serious loss in strength over short duration i.e. 40 h. Dyeing of p-aramid fabric enhances the resistance to UV light which reduces the loss in strength. Originality/value Most of the work is patented and no one has done the process optimization for the industry, so this study offers promising outcomes concerning the dyeing of p-aramid fabric with enhanced shade depth and good colour fastness characteristics.",2021,Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science,0
PRIVATE DELEGATION OUTSIDE OF EXECUTIVE SUPERVISION,; ,"Over the past decade, the Supreme Court has reworked the landscape of executive branch supervision. The Court has both addressed the scope of executive officials subject to the Constitution's selection constraints in the Appointments Clause and imposed limits on the tenure protections that Congress can bestow on senior agency officials. This refashioning re-trenched the functionalist approach that had taken hold in the twentieth century and culminated in the Court's 1989 blessing of independent coun-sels with authority to investigate the Executive Branch from within. One less-explored question is the degree to which federally prescribed tasks can be carried out by individuals other than government officials. In other words, to what extent can Congress authorize private actors to per-form statutorily required components of governmental operations such as arbitration of disputes, creation of standards tied to governmental require-ments, fact-gathering, or the performance of evaluations where the result leads to qualification or disqualification for a government service or bene-fit? Justice Alito raised this key question in a 2015 dispute involving Amtrak, when he questioned the constitutional basis for Amtrak to set metrics and standards governing passenger railroad services operating as a private actor. The question continues to plague government practice, as Congress at times prefers to employ private boards or commissions to set standards such as the quantity and type of routine pediatric services that health insurers must cover under the Affordable Care Act.From the time of the establishment of the first Congress in 1789, the federal government has employed private actors for numerous tasks. Many of those responsibilities, however, involved the provision of contractual services such as measuring the quantities of imported goods, valuing im-ported items, constructing government buildings, or providing expertise such as autopsy analysis. In modern practice, private boards or arbitration panels have at times made decisions that ultimately bind the rights or ob-ligations of private parties or that establish the substantive content for government mandates. Is there a meaningful, constitutional distinction between the early versus modern acts? What was the understanding at the time of early practice of the limits, if any, that should govern the types of tasks Congress assigned to private actors? Does the non-officer status of private actors free them from constitutional appointments and oaths con-straints? Or is there an irreducible minimum of core governmental au-thority that cannot be delegated to private actors and that must instead be exercised by governmental actors subject to the Constitution's oath and appointments accountability mechanisms?This Article will unpack some of those constitutional complexities by examining the early federal practice of delegating adjudicative patent de-terminations to private experts, which the Supreme Court briefly consid-ered in its most recent review of executive direction of governmental de-terminations. Specifically, the position of the patent commissioner, first created by Congress in 1836, was bound by fact-findings of private expert panels when denying patent applications. The Court implicitly suggested last year, in United States v. Arthrex, 141 S. Ct. 1970, 1988 (2021), that this practice did not undermine the modern presidential supervisory structure that the Court went on to mandate for the contemporary patent office because the 1836 panels consisted of just private experts, not officers. What implications, if any, does such a view hold for the scope of power or duties that private actors can exercise outside of the control or supervision of the Constitution, the President, and any constitutional accountability mechanisms purportedly constraining power? Just three years after the 1836 boards' creation, Congress went on to eliminate them and transfer their duties to a federal judge. But evidence suggests that policy consider-ations rather than constitutional concerns drove this development.Although Congress and implicitly the Court apparently have concluded that the binding fact-finding authority of the early boards did not disrupt presidential executive supervision, the evidence suggests that this super-ficially significant power really was not viewed as constituting core sov-ereign authority. The Executive Branch today has signed off on far broader private delegation of a potentially constitutionally distinct character. This Article will uncover some of those distinctions and explore how the early view of permissible private delegation, implicitly endorsed by the Supreme Court in 2021, differs substantially from some of the private arbitration and other binding private power that Congress and the Executive Branch have normalized today. The constitutional concerns over too much private delegation raised by jurists such as Justice Alito merit further exploration and may call into question several current governmental practices.",2022,Government & Law,0
A spatial analysis of an effective path for low-carbon development of energy-intensive industries,Carbon intensity; The heavy industry; Geographically weighted regression model; GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION; CO2 EMISSIONS; DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; CHINA; IMPACT; CONSUMPTION; REDUCTION; DECOMPOSITION; EFFICIENCY; TARGET,"Reducing the carbon intensity of the energy-intensive heavy industry is the key to achieving low-carbon develop-ment. The existing literature often ignore the important role of spatial effects, when investigating the heavy indus-try. The innovation of this paper is to incorporate important spatial geographic information into the analysis framework, and use the geographically weighted regression model to investigate the carbon intensity of the heavy industry in China. The findings display that: (1) environmental decentralization generates a greater impact in the eastern region, on account of the more investment in energy conservation and environmental protection. (2) The impact of urbanization on the carbon intensity in the central region is the most obvious, because this region invests more scientific and technological talents. (3) Green technology innovation contributes more to reducing carbon intensity in the central region, due to the faster growth of renewable energy patented technologies. (4) The industrial structure has little impact in the central and western regions, because their tertiary industry is underdeveloped. (5) The carbon intensity of the western region receives the least impact from foreign direct invest-ment, since the area attracts the least foreign investment. Therefore, the local governments ought to make targeted policies according to local specific conditions, in order to realize the low-carbon development of the heavy industry. ?? 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

"Innovation, productivity and intellectual property reform in an emerging market economy: evidence from India",Technical frontier; Productivity; Intellectual property reform; PATENT PROTECTION; RIGHTS; INCREASE,"This paper attempts to address the question whether intellectual property (IP) reform post-Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights agreement significantly shifted out the technology or innovation frontier, thereby raising overall productivity in the manufacturing sector of the emerging market economy of India. We explore this question using data on a reasonably large sample of manufacturing firms, for the recent period 1994-2011. Using evidence that the reform was largely exogenously driven, we note that endogeneity problems emanate mainly from the heterogeneity of its impact, that is, from the level of IP intensity of the firms and the R&D activities of the firms. We correct for such possible endogeneity biases by estimating this heterogeneity explicitly by employing varying coefficients for conditional difference-in-differences models. Our results reveal a significant outward shift in the technical or innovation frontier, but only an insignificant increase in productivity, consequent to the IP reform. A one-unit increase in the IP index is found to be associated with a response coefficient of about 0.05 in the technical frontier index for the IP-intensive firms compared to about 0.01 in the technical frontier index for the non-IP-intensive firms, both impacts being strongly significant by themselves as well as significantly different from each other. The insignificant productivity response on account of IP reform per se could at least partly be due to firms lagging behind in the adoption of the improved best practice technology.",2020,Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,0

The mathematical model employed, validated through experimental measurements, is based on a Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, describing the air flow as the continuous phase and infectious respiratory particles as the discrete phase. The CFD analyses revealed that the air cleaner could strongly reduce the inhalation of respiratory pathogens in both the investigated scenarios. The air cleaner effectiveness in the case of a close proximity scenario, expressed as relative reduction of volume of infectious respiratory particles inhaled by the exposed subject, resulted >92%. In the case of use in a shared indoor environment, instead, during a 2-h lesson, the relative reduction of volume concentration of infectious particles in the breathing zone of the exposed subject was >99%.",2023,Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,0
Energy Consumption When Transporting Pallet Loads Using a Forklift with an Anti Slip Pad Preventing Damage,energy consumption; transport; forklift; anti slip pad; PERFORMANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; IMPACT,"A large number of processes for transporting and handling palletized goods using a forklift in logistics centers is usually associated with an increase in pallet and load damage. Therefore, first of all, the damage mechanism was identified. A classic state of the art analysis was conducted. The paper presents the essence of the authors' hybrid idea of:-locking the load;-while increasing the coefficient of friction between the pallet and the forks of the forklift; but so as not to compromise on the existing functionality of the forklift forks. The idea turned out to be an innovation that required intellectual property protection, hence it was not only described in a paper but also patented. It is about an extra element that is not standard on forklifts-a forklift fork attachment. The paper discusses mechanical damage to loads involving a forklift, load damage test results, anti-slip forklift attachment, computational model of the attachment, prototype, and real-world testing of the attachment on a forklift in a logistics center. Design data from the FEM calculation system, photos of:-the prototype with components,-the prototype on tests in the logistics center were made available. The paper concludes with a pallet and load damage study performed at a logistics center and an insulation panel factory. The level of accuracy of the publication is detailed enough that the reader can make the attachment on their own and, using the content of the paper, adapt it to the needs of their own logistics system.",2021,Energy & Fuels,0

The use of natural plant extracts as corrosion inhibitors is counted by thousands of papers and industrial patents. Plant extracts contain complex phytochemicals that interact strongly with metallic surface through their electron rich sites. In this context, this review investigates the corrosion inhibitive action of henna (Lawsonia Inermis) leaves extracts on mild steel in various acid media by weight loss measurements (WL) as chemical measurements and by potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as electrochemical ones. The study indicates that as the acid concentration increases, the corrosion rate increases. The corrosion inhibition efficiency increases with an increase in the concentration of the extract. The results obtained reveal that the henna leaves extract acts as an efficient inhibitor. The adsorption of the henna leaves extracts obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The calculated thermodynamic parameters indicate that the adsorption is a spontaneous, exothermic process accompanied by an increase in entropy. Cathodic and anodic polarization curves show that the henna leaves extract is a mixed-type inhibitor. The inhibitory action is generally explained as an intermolecular synergistic effect of different components of the natural extract.",2021,Materials Science,0
Access to vaccines in Brazil and the global dynamics of the Health Economic-Industrial Complex,"National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy; Vaccines; Immunization Programs; Innovation; Access to Essential Medicines and Health Technologies; ","This study analyzed the main economic trends, market structure, production, and innovation in vaccines against infectious diseases at the global and national levels, observing the effects on access to vaccination in Brazil and on the sustainability of the Brazilian Unified National Health System. In order to update a global overview of Reel) and the market, the authors conducted a literature search and drew on a competitive intelligence database. In order to understand Brazil's role in this context, with the Health Economic-Industrial Complex as the structural focus, the authors accessed information from the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, the National Immunization Program, and the Questel Orbit Intelligence database on patent protection in Brazil; identified the technologies transferred to public institutions in Brazil; and analyzed the trend in the trade balance deficit in health. The analysis revealed a global trend of concentration of vaccine production in a few leading pharmaceutical companies and the exacerbation of economic and technological asymmetries in the vaccine sector. In Brazil, the study identified technological weaknesses, risks, and manufacturing bottlenecks that impact the guarantee of immunizations in the country and showed that despite the installed industrial base, public policies and actions by domestic manufacturers have not been sufficient to confront and overcome the global context of structural dependence. In conclusion, the study indicates the need for progress in the Brazilian national strategy to link domestic production, technological capacity-building, and innovation in the vaccine sector to help guarantee universal access to health in Brazil.",2020,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0
The negative effects of the US-China trade war on innovation: Evidence from the Chinese ICT industry,ICT Industry; Technology innovation; US-China Trade war; Differences-in-Differences; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; ANTIDUMPING PROTECTION; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDIES; INVESTMENT EVIDENCE; TRUMP; CONSTRAINTS; TECHNOLOGY; ENERGY,"Many countries, including China, have gradually realized the importance of leading innovation capabilities in the world market. The innovation capabilities of the information and communication technology (ICT) industry have received widespread attention as an important means to stimulate a productivity revolution in the new era and its innovative development. This paper adopts a differences-in-differences method and treats the US-China trade war as a quasi-natural experiment to empirically analyze its impact on technological innovation in the Chinese ICT industry. The results find that the US-China trade war has a significant negative impact on ICT firms' technological innovation, mainly by increasing their operating costs, and that the negative impact of the trade war is much greater than the positive impact from the reverse incentive effect. Moreover, the decline in technological innovation of ICT firms is mainly due to the reduction in innovation efficiency caused by the decrease in the number of patent applications for inventions with the highest technological content, rather than the change in R&D investment. In the US-China trade war, firms with low financing constraints and non-state enterprises are more significantly affected. Thus, it can be seen that the intention of the US-China trade war to inhibit the development of Chinese high-technology firms has been achieved to a certain extent, which requires new countermeasures from the Chinese government.",2023,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,0
Observational study on healthcare workers protection in the angiographic suite during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: before and during vax era,COVID-19; interventional radiology; management protocol; healthcare safety; ,"Background: Since the first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy, all the hospital facilities had to reform their daily activities. Amidst them, the Interventional Radiology Department in the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria of Novara (Italy) had to create a dedicated protocol for the patent's management during the pandemic. Design and Methods: The time interval between February 2020 and March 2021 was divided into three different periods and we reported the evolution of our safety protocol, the changes in our daily activities and the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the healthcare workers (HCW) of the Angiographic Suite. Personnel who had positive partners/family members or who had established close contacts of another nature outside the workplace were excluded from the study, in order to reduce any bias. Results: A total of 35 HCWs served in 355 patient procedures on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from February 2020 to March 2021. During the year there was a reduction in the morbidity rate first from 7.9% to 1.4% and then currently reaching 0%. Conclusions: Dedicated routes, elevators, establishing filter areas and a clear demarcation between clean and contaminated areas, dressing and undressing procedures, cleaning procedures and the obligation to always wear a surgical mask during the working shift are essential to prevent in-hospital infection. The vaccines' arrival seems to further reduce the risk for healthcare workers, but it is still necessary to take docile precautions in view of the new mutations of the virus.",2021,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0

Atherosclerosis is the principal pathology underlying the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease. However, whether DYNT is effective at mitigating atherosclerosis remains unknown. Aims of the study: The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the potential impact of DYNT treatment on the atherosclerotic lesions and associated pathological mechanisms. Materials and methods: Histological, immunohistochemical, molecular biological approaches were adopted to investigate the pharmacological impact of DYNT treatment on atherosclerosis and associated pathophysiological alterations in the high fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE gene deficient (ApoE-/- ) mice. Results: DYNT treatment reduced the size of the atherosclerotic plaques, alleviated the necrotic core, lowered the lipid retention, mitigated the macrophagic burden and decreased the expression of proatherogenic chemokine Ccl2 in the atherosclerotic lesions. DYNT treatment also offered partial protection against atherogenic dyslipidemia and mitigated hepatic lipid content as well as fatty liver pathologies in the HFD-fed ApoE-/- mice. Furthermore, DYNT treatment protected against atherosclerosis-associated gut dysbiosis and impairment in the intestinal epithelial barrier. Conclusions: Our work provides novel preclinical evidence that underpins the multifaceted effects of DYNT in the control of atherosclerosis.",2024,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,0

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is defined as a more serious process of MAFLD with liver inflammation. Purpose: This study aims to observe the alleviation of Yinhuang granule (YHG), a Chinese patent medicine, on methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD)-induced MAFLD in mice. Methods: Network pharmacology was used to analyze the improving effect of YHG on MAFLD and possible targets. MAFLD was induced in mice by MCD diet feeding for 6 weeks. In the last 2 weeks, the mice were orally given with YHG (400, 800 mg/kg) every day. Biochemical parameters of serum and liver, as well as hepatic gene expression were detected. Results: Network pharmacology showed that YHG could improve MAFLD, inflammation, liver fibrosis, and oxidative stress. In animal experiments, YHG reduced hepatocellular damage and hepatic lipids accumulation which induced by MCD. In terms of liver inflammation, YHG attenuated MCD-induced liver inflammation in mice. YHG also inhibited the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and alleviated liver fibrosis in MCD-fed mice. Through nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, YHG alleviated liver oxidative stress injury in mice which induced by MCD. Conclusion: YHG ameliorated MCD-induced MAFLD in mice by reducing hepatic lipids accumulation, alleviating liver oxidative, inflammatory injury and attenuating hepatic fibrosis.",2021,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,0

In UK, Italy and Poland, the IP box tax relief was introduced in 2013, 2015 and 2019, respectively. In return, companies may reduce their tax rate to increase their investment and innovativeness. With a panel model approach - system GMM and DiD with multiple time periods - it analyses data from the Orbis database for 2011-2019 of 673 firms from the gaming industry in 11 countries and hand-collected data on intellectual property rights protection. The authors study public and private companies from the gaming sector in leading European markets and all three countries that protect intellectual property rights of software (Japan, South Korea, the USA).FindingsRecent reforms enable gaming companies to use preferential tax treatment for IP-related income and significantly impact a firm's revenue growth.Practical implicationsNevertheless, European gaming firms require time to leap the gap to the growth and innovativeness of countries that protect software.Originality/valueThe authors show that the IP box stimulates gaming firms to protect IP via wordmarks, figurative marks, trademarks and software patents that bring effects in five years.

'Prioritized Distribution of Equal Shares'-An Ethical and Practicable Allocation Framework for COVID-19 Vaccines,COVID-19; allocation; vaccine; COVAX; distributional justice; global health ethics; human rights; ,"In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the fast and equitable distribution of effective vaccines worldwide is one of the challenges faced by international institutions in charge, as global equity in vaccine supply has not yet been achieved. Our paper explains the current state of ethical research on equity in global COVID-19 vaccine allocation, focusing on the COVAX Facility established by the WHO, acting as the global vaccine distributor. The article presents a detailed analysis of the first year of COVAX allocation in 2021 identifying problematic aspects of its allocation framework regarding the implementation of COVAX's fundamental allocation principles. We argue that the COVAX Facility has developed a proper concept to deal with global vaccine allocation-but to address uncovered defaults, we introduce the 'Prioritized Distribution of Equal Shares' model-a both ethical and practically feasible alternative allocation framework to protect the value of human lives in both high- and low-income countries through fair and fast global vaccine distribution in health emergencies. Nonetheless, we argue that the COVAX Facility remains the main organization to provide equitable access to vaccines. Yet, the global community has to consider further aspects such as patent protection, vaccine production and the lack of power of global structures to address the inequities that have arisen. Since new wars and further crises have arisen, a shift in public global attention endangers the processing of COVID-19-related issues. That is why now more than ever extensive efforts to achieve vaccine equity are needed.",2023,History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,0
Endovascular flow-diversion of visceral and renal artery aneurysms using dual-layer braided nitinol carotid stents,Dual layer; Stent; CASPER; Aneurysm; Visceral; Renal; Splenic; MICROMESH STENT; CURRENT MANAGEMENT,"BackgroundVisceral and renal artery aneurysms (VRAAs) are uncommon but are associated with a high mortality rate in the event of rupture. Endovascular treatment is now first line in many centres, but preservation of arterial flow may be difficult in unfavourable anatomy including wide necked aneurysms, parent artery tortuosity and proximity to arterial bifurcations. Endovascular stenting, and in particular flow-diversion, is used in neurovascular intervention to treat intracranial aneurysms but is less often utilised in the treatment of VRAAs. The CASPER stent is a low profile dual-layer braided nitinol stent designed for carotid stenting with embolic protection and flow-diversion properties. We report the novel use of the CASPER stent for the treatment of VRAAs. We present a case series describing the treatment of six patients with VRAAs using the CASPER stent.ResultsSix patients with unruptured VRAAs were treated electively. There were three splenic artery aneurysms and three renalartery aneurysms. Aneurysms were treated with the CASPER stent, with or without loose aneurysm coil packing or liquid embolic depending on size and morphology. All stents were successfully deployed with no immediate or periprocedural complications. Four aneurysms completely occluded after serial imaging follow up with one case requiring repeat CASPER stenting for complete occlusion. In one patient a single aneurysm remained patent at last follow up, A single case was complicated by delated splenic infarction and surgical splenectomy.ConclusionPreliminary experience with the CASPER stent suggests it is technically feasible and effective for use in the treatment of VRAAs.",2020,"Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",0
The Effects of Foreign Direct Investment on Green Technology Innovation: New Evidence from China's 278 Cities,Foreign direct investment; green technology innovation; technology spillovers; granted green patents; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; POSITIVE SPILLOVERS; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; CARBON EMISSIONS; FDI; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE; TRADE,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) has played a pivotal role in fostering economic development, and the FDI technology spillover effect is one of the core forces driving an open economy toward new green growth milestones. Evaluating the impact of FDI inflows on green innovation is essential for sustainable and environment-friendly city design. Based on the panel data of 278 cities in China from 2010-2019, we conducted an empirical analysis to test the impact and mechanisms of FDI on green technology innovation (GTI). The results demonstrate that FDI has a positive and highly significant effect on GTI. The channel analysis indicates that the FDI significantly stimulates urban GTI through two mechanisms: alleviating financing restraints and mitigating the risk of new GTI in the early stages. In the heterogeneity analysis, we find that the FDI effect is more pronounced in China's resource-based regions with high levels of institutional and human capital and in regions with low-carbon pilot policies and good protection of intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the study shows FDI can affect GTI in neighboring areas through spatial spillover effects. Our findings underscore the importance of encouraging and sustaining internationalization in environmentally friendly sectors to foster green transformation. In essence, developing foreign investment policies and enhancing the green technology spillover effect of FDI are vital for strengthening GTI capacity.",2024,Business & Economics; International Relations,0
A proprietary component manufacturer?s global supply chain design: The impacts of tax and organizational structure *,Proprietary component manufacturer; Global supply chain; Tax; Organizational structure; Transfer price; SOURCING STRATEGIES; CONTROL POLICIES; OFFSHORE; DECISIONS,"This paper studies the supply chain structure design for a proprietary component manufacturer (PCM) in a global environment. The PCM, producing component with patent protection and/or superior quality, chooses to enter into an overseas market to enhance revenue. There are three supply chain structures available to the PCM: (1) monopoly where the PCM establishes a downstream manufacturing subsidiary to produce and sell the end product, (2) component supplier where the PCM supplies component to a local original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and (3) dual distributor where the PCM supplies component to the OEM but also produces a competing end product. Our analysis suggests that two important features in a global environment, i.e., the global tax disparity and the organizational structure, have significant impacts on the PCM's supply chain structure design and profits. If the downstream has a tax advantage, it is optimal for the PCM to directly enter into the downstream market with the structure of monopoly. As the downstream tax rate increases, the other two structures, i.e., component supplier and dual distributor, become more attractive. We show that centralization makes the dual distributor and monopoly structures more desirable. However, the OEM may be driven out of the market and the dual distributor structure is infeasible when the downstream tax rate is high enough. Contrary to our traditional wisdom, decentralization may benefit the PCM under certain circumstances. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously demonstrated that chronic post-ischemic administration of metformin improved functional recovery in experimental cerebral ischemia. However, few beneficial effects of metformin on the acute phase of cerebral ischemia were reported either in experimental animals or in stroke patients, which limits the application of metformin in stroke. We hypothesized that slow cellular uptake of metformin hydrochloride may contribute to the lack of efficacy in acute stroke. We recently developed and patented a novel metformin derivative, metformin threonate (SHY-01). Pharmacokinetic profile in vivo and in cultured cells revealed that metformin is more rapidly uptaken and accumulated from SHY-01 than metformin hydrochloride. Accordingly, SHY-01 treatment exhibited more potent and rapid activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Furthermore, SHY-01 elicited a stronger inhibition of microglia activation and more potent neuroprotection when compared to metformin hydrochloride. SHY-01 administration also had superior beneficial effects on neurologic functional recovery in experimental stroke and offered strong protection against acute cerebral ischemia with reduced infarct volume and mortality, as well as the improved sensorimotor and cognitive functions in rats. Collectively, these results indicated that SHY-01 had an improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profile and produced more potent protective effects on acute stroke and long-term neurological damage. We propose that SHY-01 is a very promising therapeutic candidate for cerebral ischemic stroke.",2022,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
Nadorcott Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain (Tribunal Supremo) 11 June 2020-Case No. 282/2020,Breeders' rights; Exhaustion; Commercial exploitation; Right of ownership; Acts of production or reproduction; Variety constituents; Planting and harvesting; ,"Plant variety rights, like other intellectual property rights broadly considered (e.g. patents or registered designs), are alien to the effect provided for in Art. 85 of the Commercial Code (statute of limitations). The scope of the breeder's and its exhaustion are governed by the plant variety legislation itself, and no other forms or means of exhaustion of the right of ownership over tangible assets apply. There is a distinction between infringement claims as such, which concern acts of infringement subsequent to the grant of a Community plant variety right, and provisional protection in respect of acts prior to the grant. The planting of a protected variety and the harvesting of the fruits from plants of that variety may not be regarded as an act of production or reproduction (multiplication) of variety constituents within the meaning of Art. 13(2)(a) of Regulation No. 2100/94. A breeder may not prohibit the use of variety constituents for the sole purpose of producing an agricultural harvest, but merely acts leading to the reproduction and propagation of the protected variety. The activity of planting a protected variety and harvesting the fruit thereof, which is not liable to be used as propagating material, only requires the authorisation of the holder of the Community plant variety right relating to that plant variety where the conditions laid down in Art. 13(3) of that regulation are fulfilled. Article 13(3) of Regulation No. 2100/94 is interpreted as meaning that the fruit of a plant variety, which is not likely to be used as propagating material, may not be regarded as having been obtained through the unauthorised use of variety constituents of that plant variety, within the meaning of that provision, where those variety constituents were propagated and sold to a farmer by a nursery in the period between the publication of the application for a Community plant variety right in relation to that plant variety and the grant thereof. The essential prerequisite for the application of the provisional protection provided for in Art. 95 of the Regulation is that a person carries out an act that would be prohibited subsequent thereto.",2021,Government & Law,0

The goal is to increase the impact and reduce the cost of PfSPZ vaccines by optimizing vaccine potency and manufacturing, which will benefit from identification of immunological responses contributing to protection in humans. Currently, there is no authentic animal challenge model for assessing P. falciparum malaria VE. Alternatively, Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk), which infects humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs) in nature, can be used to experimentally infect rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatto) to assess VE. Methods: Sanaria has, therefore, produced purified, vialed, cryopreserved PkSPZ and conducted challenge studies in several naive NHP cohorts. In the first cohort, groups of three rhesus macaques each received doses of 5 x 10(2), 2.5 x 10(3), 1.25 x 10(4)and 2.5 x 10(4) PkSPZ administered by direct venous inoculation. The infectivity of 1.5 x 10(3) PkSPZ cryopreserved with an altered method and of 1.5 x 10(3) PkSPZ cryopreserved for four years was tested in a second and third cohort of rhesus NHPs. The lastly, three pig-tailed macaques (Macaw nemestrino), a natural P. knowlesi host, were challenged with 2.5 x 10(3) PkSPZ cryopreserved six years earlier. Results: In the first cohort, all 12 animals developed P knowlesi parasitaemia by thick blood smear, and the time to positivity (prepatent period) followed a non-linear 4-parameter logistic sigmoidal model with a median of 11, 10, 8, and 7 days, respectively (r(2) = 1). PkSPZ cryopreserved using a modified rapid-scalable method infected rhesus with a pre-patent period of 10 days, as did PkSPZ cryopreserved four years prior to infection, similar to the control group. Cryopreserved PkSPZ infected pig-tailed macaques with median time to positivity by thin smear, of 11 days. Conclusion: This study establishes the capacity to consistently infect NHPs with purified, vialed, cryopreserved PkSPZ, providing a foundation for future studies to probe protective immunological mechanisms elicited by PfSPZ vaccines that cannot be established in humans.",2022,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,0
The Evolution of Supply and Demand in Markets for Generic Drugs,generic drugs; drug prices; drug shortages; drug regulation; PRICE-COMPETITION; ENTRY,"Policy Points Much concern about generic drug markets has emerged in recent policy debates. Important changes in regulations, the structure of purchasing, and the length of the drug supply chain have affected generic drug markets. Effective price competition remains the rule in generic markets for large-selling drugs. Smaller markets and those for injectable products often have less price competition and are more susceptible to supply disruptions. Context The image of generic drugs as a commodity sold in competitive markets is an oversimplification, as evidenced by increasing accounts of price spikes, sustained high price-cost margins, and market disruptions. The mismatch between the canonical economic model of generic drug markets and reality motivated our empirical project. Methods To explore recent changes in those factors impacting the supply and demand for generic drugs, we studied, from a variety of sources, the data on price, competition, supply disruptions and recalls, changes to the supply chain, and buy-side concentration. We examined quarterly data through 2018 for a cohort of 77 molecules that lost patent protection during the so-called patent cliff between 2010 and 2013. Findings On the supply side, we found that for large-market oral solids, generic entry and price declines were consistent with past studies showing a significant number of market entrants and substantial reductions in the average price of a molecule. In smaller markets for oral solids and injectable products, we observed fewer entrants, higher rates of exit, smaller price reductions, and, in some cases, considerable price instability. The number of reported shortages increased across all generic market types over time, with the rate of shortage increases especially pronounced in markets for injectable products. The number of product recalls also rose over our study period. Although we did not estimate causal effects, we did find several changes in the market environment for generic drugs that may contribute to these phenomena. The demand side for generics has become more concentrated. Supply chains rely more on producers outside the United States (particularly from China and India). Contracting practices have undergone changes that may inhibit competition in product supply. FDA regulatory scruitiny has increased. Conclusions Competition in generic drug markets varies widely by market size and product form. Recent changes in demand-side market structure imply more downward pressure on prices stemming from buy-side concentration. The FDA's greater regulatory oversight puts upward pressure on costs, and the lengthening of the supply chain increases production uncertainty for producers. Demand and supply-side changes point to further market instabilities across all generic markets due to producers' changing economic position.",2021,Health Care Sciences & Services,0
Defining Trade Secrets in the United States: Past and Present Challenges - A Way Forward?,Trade secrets; Defend Trade Secrets Act; Economic Espionage Act; Uniform Trade Secrets Act; TRIPS Agreement; Know-how; PROTECTION,"When approaching an analysis of a particular area of law, one must initially locate and understand the definition of its core concept. Yet in trade secret law serious obstacles impede the process. Unlike other intellectual property (IP) regimes, such as copyright and patent law, the core concepts of which are subject to unitary definitions governed by international treaties or domestic statutes, the trade secret concept has received no parallel treatment and, until recently in the United States, remained mainly defined under common law. Subtle differences in the way trade secrets were judicially conceived often generated conflicts between courts, opening the door for the application of divergent rules on similar points. This confusing background prompted the individual U.S. jurisdictions to gradually orient towards implementing statutory provisions in defining trade secrets. Despite the fact that U.S. trade secret law has since seen several statutory interventions at state and federal level, the precise meaning and definitional parameters of the concept remain elusive. This paper probes the existing trade secret definitions applicable in the U.S. via analysis of the divergent sources of law that underscored their formulation from the past until the present and identifies the challenges pertinent to their application in practice. Its aim is to analyze and compare these legal sources: first, to determine whether the current definition for the concept of a trade secret is adequate, or whether perhaps the existence of the multi-tier system impedes a party's ability to identify trade secrets in a cross-border context; and second, to investigate whether a unanimously accepted definition under a pre-emptive statute complementary to one under an elaborated internationally binding treaty might remedy this issue.",2023,Government & Law,0

With the expiration of patent protection in Europe in 2018 and in United States by 2023, the landscape is changing as up to 10 adalimumab biosimilars are expected to enter the market in the US. Biosimilars offer the potential to lower costs on health care systems and increase patient accessibility. The analytical similarity of seven different adalimumab biosimilars was accomplished in the present study using the multi-attribute method (MAM), a LC -MS based peptide mapping technique that allows for primary sequence assessment and evaluation of multiple quality attributes including deamidation, oxidation, succinimide formation, N-and C-terminal composition and detailed N-glycosylation analysis. In the first step, characterization of the most relevant post-translational modifications of a reference product was attained during the discovery phase of MAM. During the second step, as part of the MAM targeted monitoring phase, adalimumab batch-to batch variability was evaluated to define statistical intervals for the establishment of similarity ranges. The third step describes biosimilarity evaluation of predefined quality attributes and new peak detection for the assessment of any new or modified peak compared to the reference product. This study highlights a new perspective of the MAM approach and its underlying power for biotherapeutic comparability exercises in addition to analytical characterization. MAM offers a streamlined comparability assessment workflow based on high-confidence quality attribute analysis using high-resolution accurate mass mass spectrometry (HRAM MS) and the capability to detect any new or modified peak compared to the reference product.",2023,Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

This has encouraged some researchers to publish reviewer papers on different monitoring techniques of PV plants. The main contribution of this article compared to those previous works is to present state-of-the-art monitoring techniques for every type of fault. It also describes the fundamental concepts of the sensors used which is necessary to grasp their limitations and to understand the design solutions which were made with regard to satisfying some safety and accuracy constraints. For instance, the article reviews five different kinds of voltage/current sensors having different accuracy levels and suggests their adequate placement within PV plants. In addition to the recent research findings disclosed in patents, the article also presents currently commercially available smart sensors dedicated to PV monitoring, as well as the most recent findings in industry and real-field experience. This includes for instance NTT's recent work to monitor a 2-MW PV plant using drones or undetectable faults which may be caused by placing indispensable protective relays within the PV plants. Most of the current review papers were less comprehensive and they mainly focused on academic works.",2023,Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,0
The Covenants of the Prophet and the Problems of Transmission: An Analysis of a Manuscript Copied by Faris al-Shidyaq,Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq; Covenants of the Prophet Muhammad; Mu'awiyah; 'Ali ibn Abi Talib; Rashid Dahdah; Ibrahim Mohamed Zein; Ahmed El-Wakil; Jeanne Aubert; William Scawen Blunt; Chronicle of Seert; Treaty of Najran; religious pluralism; John Rylands Library; ,"This study examines a covenant of the Prophet, namely, a treaty, patent of protection or charter of privileges, that was copied by Faris al-Shidyaq at some time before the middle of the nineteenth century. It provides a biographical sketch of the copyist. It reproduces the Arabic original as found in Majmu' fawa'id along with an English translation. This is followed by a commentary on the covenant and a series of conclusions, namely, that the Shidyaq Covenant from 1857 is a copy of the Rylands Covenant, which appears to be an Ottoman-issued document dating from the sixteenth or seventeenth century. This Shidyaq/Rylands Covenant could represent the missing link between the Covenant of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of Najran, found in the Chronicle of Seert, and the Covenant of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of the World, namely, the Testamentum et Pactiones made famous by Gabriel Sionita in 1630. The significance of this study resides in the fact that it shares a previously unpublished and unstudied covenant of the Prophet Muhammad, in both Arabic and English, with the scholarly community, while exploring the problems posed by transmission. The more covenants that are rediscovered, the better we will understand their origin, diffusion, and relationship, allowing us to better assess their authenticity. What is more, if these documents are accepted by Muslims as authentic, either in word or in spirit, they can help counter and prevent radicalization, promote moderation, and help protect minorities.",2021,Religion,0
Innovation in insecticide discovery: Approaches to the discovery of new classes of insecticides,insecticide discovery; natural products; crop protection compounds; agrochemical industry; competitor-inspired; first-in-class; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; ACARICIDE; GENERATION; DESIGN; PYRETHROIDS; PIPELINE; ANALOGS; TRENDS; MIMICS,"The continuing demand for agrochemical insecticides that can meet increasing grower, environmental, consumer and regulatory requirements creates the need for the development of new solutions for managing crop pest insects. The development of resistance to the currently available insecticidal products adds another critical driver for new insecticidal active ingredients (AIs). One avenue to meeting these challenges is the creation of new classes of insecticidal molecules to act as starting points and prototypes stimulating further spectrum, efficacy and environmental impact refinements. A new class of insecticides is foreshadowed by the first molecule exemplifying that class (first-in-class, FIC) and offers one measure of innovation within the agrochemical industry. Most insecticides owe their discovery to competitor-inspired (i.e. competitor patents/products) or next-generation (follow-on to a company's pre-existing product) strategies. In contrast, FIC insecticides primarily emerge from a bioactive hypothesis approach, with the largest segment resulting from the exploration of new areas of chemistry/heterocycles and underexploited motifs. Natural products also play an important role in the discovery of FIC insecticides. Understanding the origins of these FIC compounds and the approaches used in their discovery can provide insights into successful strategies for future FIC insecticides. This review analyses information on historic and recently introduced FIC insecticides. Its main objective has been to identify the most successful discovery strategies for identifying new agrochemical solutions to meet the challenge of minimizing crop losses resulting from insects.

"Rent appropriation in global value chains: The past, present, and future of intangible assets",competitive advantage; global value chains; intangible assets; multinational enterprises; rents; INNOVATION; INVESTMENT; ECONOMY; GROWTH; JAPAN; TRADE; RISE,"Research Summary The argument of this article is that global strategy research should devote greater attention to rent appropriation in global value chains (GVCs). We discuss the concept of intangible assets, emphasize their scalability at low marginal cost and highlight strategies for the appropriation of rents from these assets. Returns captured by intangible assets are shown to be much greater than those captured by tangible assets in GVCs of manufactured products. Regions in the world are found to be specializing in different GVC stages, with China rising as a key location for rent generation in upstream and production activities. We conclude that the rents from intangible assets are major drivers of economic development and of corporate success and offer insights into rent appropriation trends in the future. Managerial Summary Intangible assets include computerized information (such as databases and software), innovative property (such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights), and economic competencies (such as brand equity and organizational capital). Our analysis shows that the returns to intangible assets in the GVCs of manufactured goods have risen substantially in importance over the past 20 years. A further finding is that within GVCs, the rent share of upstream stages has been increasing at the expense of rents shares of both the production and downstream stages. These findings suggest that the effective deployment, management, and protection of intangible assets is of critical importance to the ability of firms to create and maintain sustainable competitive advantages in global markets. In GVCs, intangibles matter, big time!",2022,Business & Economics,0

Biochemistry, 1984 Oct 9; 23(21): 5036-41. doi: 10.1021/bi00316a032). These led to the first protein kinase inhibitor approved for medical use (fasudil), an inhibitor of the AGC subfamily Rho kinase. With potencies strong enough to compete against endogenous ATP, the isoquinoline compounds established the druggability of the ATP binding site. Crystal structures of their protein kinase complexes, including with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), showed interactions that, on the one hand, could mimic ATP but, on the other hand, could be optimized for high potency binding, kinase selectivity, and diversification away from adenosine. They also showed the flexibility of the glycine-rich loop, and PKA became a major prototype for crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of protein kinase mechanism and dynamic activity control. Since fasudil, more than 70 kinase inhibitors have been approved for clinical use, involving efforts that progressively have introduced new paradigms of data driven drug discovery. Publicly available data alone comprise over 5000 protein kinase crystal structures and hundreds of thousands of binding data. Now, new methods, including artificial intelligence techniques and expansion of protein kinase targeting approaches, together with the expiration of patent protection for optimized inhibitor scaffolds, promise even greater advances in drug discovery. Looking back to the time of the first isoquinoline hinge binders brings the current state-of-the-art into stark contrast. Appropriately for this Perspective article, many of the milestone papers during this time were published in Biochemistry (now ACS Biochemistry).",2021,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,0
Welfare effects of public procurement of medicines: Evidence from Ecuador,Government procurement; Pharmaceutical markets; Developing economy; Consumer welfare; Targeting; PATENT PROTECTION; FIELD EXPERIMENT; HEALTH-SERVICES; MARKET; ENTRY; PHARMACEUTICALS; DEMAND; INCOME; COMPETITION; COUNTRIES,"This article evaluates the welfare implications of a public procurement program, where the Ecuadorian government procures medicines used for cancer treatment and distributes it to patients for free with the aim to benefit the poor. Using a unique dataset on Ecuador's pharmaceutical market, we estimate a structural model of demand and supply, and focus on two research questions related to this program. First, we consider a targeting strategy commonly implemented in various developing countries, where patients below a given income threshold qualify for the free drug. We compare this with a simpler drug distribution mechanism where every patient is a potential recipient of the free drug and the patients are served on first-come-first-serve basis. Our results show that the poor patients do self-select into the program, and the first-come-first-serve strategy does benefit the poor more compared to the relatively rich. However, the targeting strategy does a much better job in serving the poorest patients. Second, we study the supply side implications of this program. Our counterfactual exercises show that when the government procures low-cost drugs and provides them for free, it distorts the supply side incentives, and hence, market prices of similar low-cost drugs may increase by about 7% in response. Prices of the high cost drugs remain mostly unaffected. Therefore, the policy may end up negatively affecting near-poor patients that did not qualify for the free government drug.

Early versus late caffeine and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for prevention of intermittent hypoxia-induced neuroinflammation in the neonatal rat,brain; caffeine; cytokines; ibuprofen; intermittent hypoxia; myelination; neuroinflammation; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PATENT DUCTUS-ARTERIOSUS; WHITE-MATTER; BRAIN-INJURY; DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITY; KETOROLAC TROMETHAMINE; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; PREMATURE-INFANTS; DAMAGE; OXYGEN; VULNERABILITY,"Preterm infants often experience frequent intermittent hypoxia (IH) episodes which are associated with neuroinflammation. We tested the hypotheses that early caffeine and/or non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) confer superior therapeutic benefits for protection against IH-induced neuroinflammation than late treatment. Newborn rats were exposed to IH or hyperoxia (50% O2) from birth (P0) to P14. For early treatment, the pups were administered: 1) daily caffeine (Caff) citrate (Cafcit, 20 mg/kg IP loading on P0, followed by 5 mg/kg from P1-P14); 2) ketorolac (Keto) topical ocular solution in both eyes from P0 to P14; 3) ibuprofen (Ibu, Neoprofen, 10 mg/kg loading dose on P0 followed by 5 mg/kg/day on P1 and P2); 4) Caff+Keto co-treatment; 5) Caff+Ibu co-treatment; or 6) equivalent volume saline (Sal). On P14, animals were placed in room air (RA) with no further treatment until P21. For late treatment, pups were exposed from P0 to P14, then placed in RA during which they received similar treatments from P15-P21 (Sal, Caff, and/or Keto), or P15-P17 (Ibu). RA controls were similarly treated. At P21, whole brains were assessed for histopathology, apoptosis, myelination, and biomarkers of inflammation. IH caused significant brain injury and hemorrhage, inflammation, reduced myelination, and apoptosis. Early treatment with Caff alone or in combination with NSAIDs conferred better neuroprotection against IH-induced damage than late treatment. Early postnatal treatment during a critical time of brain development, may be preferable for the prevention of IH-induced brain injury in preterm infants.",2024,Developmental Biology; Neurosciences & Neurology,0

Recently, researchers have developed patents (US9757529, 2019) of inhalable aspirin for rapid absorption and circumvention of gastric irritation. Objective: The aim of this work was to formulate aspirin-loaded lipid based formulation in order to enhance oral bioavailability and inhibit gastric irritation. Methods: This solid lipid microparticles loaded with aspirin (SLM) was formulated by a modified cold homogenization-solvent evaporation method. In vitro studies such as in vitro drug release, particle size, Encapsulation Efficiency (EE), micromeritic properties and loading capacity were carried out. Pharmacodynamics studies such as anti-inflammatory and ulcerative properties of the SLM were also carried out in Wistar rats. Results: The results showed that aspirin entrapped SLM exhibited the highest EE of 72% and particle size range of 7.60 +/- 0.141 mu m to 20.25 +/- 0.070 mu m. Formulations had about 55% drug release at 6h in simulated intestinal fluid pH 6.8. The formulations had good flowability that could facilitate filling into hard gelatin capsule shells. The SLM exhibited 100% gastroprotection against aspirin-induced ulcers (p < 0.05). The percentage of anti-inflammatory activities also showed that aspirin-entrapped SLM had 78% oedema inhibition at 7h, while the reference had 68% inhibition at 7h. Conclusion: Aspirin-entrapped SLM showed good sustained-release properties, enhanced anti-inflammatory properties and total gastric protection from aspirin-induced ulcers and could be used as once-daily oral aspirin.",2020,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
Cybercrimes and Alternative Settlement of Intellectual Property (IPR) Disputes in Indonesia,alternative dispute resolution; cyberspace; intellectual property; arbitration; ,"This study aimed to analyze the violation of IPR in the context of cybercrimes in Indonesia, particularly those where foreign investors are involved and an alternative arbitrary mechanism was adopted. The data was collected through a review of archives, previous literature and the government regulations that regulate foreign arbitration in international agreements. The study found out that the Indonesian government has filled the void in foreign arbitration regulations though IPR laws such as Law No. 31 of 2000 concerning Industrial Design, Law No. 30 of 2000 concerning Trade Secrets, Law No. 32 of 2001 concerning Layout Design of Integrated Circuits, Law No. 28 of 2014 concerning Copyright, Law No. 13 of 2016 concerning Patents, and Law No. 20 of 2016 concerning Trademarks and Geographical Indications. The study also found out that currently there is no statute in the country which explicitly permits the arbitration for disputes regarding cybercrimes or online crimes committed in IPR domains like copyrights and trademark disputes. However, when arbitration is chosen as the alternative dispute resolution mechanism for IPR reacted issues, Intellectual Property Rights Arbitration and Mediation Body (Badan Arbitrase dan Mediasi Hak Kekayaan Intelektual, BAMHKI) is entrusted the task to work as an arbitration agency. Despite these regulatory initiatives, however, it was found that there is still a need to adopt a protection mechanism against cybercrimes that are exceeding in number owing to the abuse of Internet and technology. The study recommends the Indonesian government to provide remedies against cybercrimes to all capital providers and foreign investors in order to attract foreign investors and to give confidence to entrepreneurs from developed countries.",2022,Criminology & Penology,0
Substantive digital innovation or symbolic digital innovation: Which type of digital innovation is more conducive to corporate ESG performance?,Digital technology innovation; ESG; Substantive innovation; Symbolic innovation; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; INFORMATION; IMPACT; SYSTEMS,"The synergistic development of digitization and greening is an inherent demand for the holistic reshaping and upgrading of the global economy. This study explores the pivotal role of heterogeneous digital innovation in improving corporate environment, society, and governance (ESG) performance to investigate the compatibility path between enterprise digitalization and sustainable development. Compared to previous literature, this paper adopts patent data provided by IPC to identify corporate digital technology innovation, evaluating the influence of digital innovation on corporate ESG performance with a specific focus on inherent innovation motivation. Based on a sample of Chinese listed companies from 2012 to 2021, the study reveals a significant enhancement of digital technology innovation in corporate ESG performance, verifying that substantive digital innovation can stimulate higher ESG performance. Digital technology innovation operates mainly by stimulating green innovation and improving information disclosure quality. The Governance pillar benefits the most among each ESG pillar, whereas there is no evidence that symbolic digital innovation can boost the Environment pillar. Furthermore, the study highlights the vital roles played by intellectual property protection and corporate innovation-oriented strategy, which can amplify the positive impacts of digital technology innovation, especially substantive innovation, on ESG performance. Moreover, substantive digital innovation can inhibit corporate greenwashing, while symbolic innovation cannot. These findings contribute to fresh micro-level evidence of the non-economic implications of the digital economy, providing novel insights into the intricate interplay between digital technology innovation and ESG performance through a process-oriented lens, offering cogent policy recommendations to foster increased business engagement in ESG activities.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Ag nanoparticles enhancing Phaseolus vulgaris seedling development: understanding nanoparticle migration and chemical transformation across the seed coat,; SILVER NANOPARTICLES; WATER-UPTAKE; GERMINATION; SULFIDATION; MECHANISM; TOXICITY; IMPACT,"The increasing number of patents suggests that the use of nanoparticles (NPs) in agriculture will continue to grow in the future. Properties associated with nanosized objects might be desirable, but may pose a threat to the environment since the fate of nanomaterials is poorly understood. Seed treatment is an extensive practice to provide micronutrients and disease protection. This study investigates the effect of Ag2S NPs, Ag-0 NPs, and AgNO3 (1, 100, and 1000 mg Ag per L) on the germination of Phaseolus vulgaris seeds and the mechanism of interaction in the seed coat. Ag treatments did not affect the germination rate. On the other hand, the development of seedlings was significantly improved by Ag2S NPs while AgNO3 showed a negative effect compared to the control (water). Silver from different sources was accumulated and biotransformed along the seed coat. Ag from the AgNO3 treatment was found as AgCl and bound to oxygen, and Ag-0 NPs underwent oxidative dissolution forming thiolate complexes. On the other hand, Ag2S NPs did not show any detectable chemical changes. Silver distribution and speciation were investigated in the bean testa using mu-XRF and mu-XANES, while the macromolecular composition was assessed by ATR-FTIR. The Ag biotransformation depended on the source. For the FTIR results, it is possible to verify perturbations in the carbohydrate region as well as changes in the protein region. The combination of these results can contribute to building another step in the understanding of how nanoparticles can improve agricultural inputs and benefit food crops.",2021,Chemistry; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
Patency of separate tube grafts for intercostal artery reconstruction: Size and length matter,spinal cord protection; aortic surgery; intercostal artery reconstruction; patency; AORTIC-SURGERY; BLOOD-FLOW; IMMEDIATE,"OBJECTIVES: Low patency is a major concern when using separate tube grafts for intercostal artery reconstruction. Our goal was to elucidate the optimal size and length of grafts from their patency and the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). METHODS: The patency, size and length of separate tube grafts were evaluated in 41 patients. Simulation of CFD was performed in a model derived from a patient with a patent 12-mm graft that was 15mm long, with 2 simulation models with a smaller (8-mm) or longer (30-mm) graft. RESULTS: A total of 49 grafts were used for intercostal artery reconstruction. There was 1 in-hospital death and 2 spinal cord injuries. The patency rate, which could be evaluated in 46 grafts, was 63% (29/46). It was 71% (24/34) in thoracoabdominal aortic replacement and 42% (5/12) in descending aortic replacement. Among 14 patients in whom all grafts were occluded, no patients developed spinal cord injury. All grafts longer than 25mm were occluded (n = 5). Eight- and 10-mm grafts showed better patency than 12-mm grafts in thoracoabdominal aortic replacement (P = 0.008) when grafts were shorter than 25 mm. Simulation of CFD revealed vortical flow within the 12-mm graft, which did not reach the intercostal orifice, whereas helical flow was maintained throughout the cardiac cycle within the 8-mm graft. CONCLUSIONS: Eight- and 10-mm grafts seemed better than 12-mm grafts, and grafts should be kept shorter than 25 mm. Simulation of CFD may shed light on the issue of the optimal intercostal artery reconstruction technique.",2023,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery,0
Real-World Budget Impact of the Adoption of Insulin Glargine Biosimilars in Primary Care in England (2015-2018),; ,"BACKGROUND Lantus, the reference insulin glargine used for the treatment of diabetes, lost its patent protection in 2014, opening the market to biosimilar competitors. OBJECTIVE First, to analyze the adoption rates of insulin glargine biosimilars in primary care in England and estimate the savings realized and missed, since an insulin glargine biosimilar was first used, and second, to assess potential variations in adoption rates across Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data sets capturing information on all insulin glargine items prescribed by all general practitioners up to December 2018 were used. Total costs of insulin glargine and uptake rates of biosimilars were calculated. The real-world budget impact was estimated assuming the cost of reference insulin glargine for all items and comparing the total costs in this scenario with the total costs in the real world. The missed savings were estimated assuming the cost of biosimilars for all insulin glargine items. Choropleth maps were generated to assess potential variations in uptake across CCGs. RESULTS Insulin glargine biosimilars generated savings of 900,000 pound between October 2015 (time of first prescription) and December 2018. The missed savings amounted to 25.6 pound million in this period, indicating that only 3.42% of the potential savings were achieved. The analyses demonstrated a large level of variation in the uptake of insulin glargine biosimilars across CCGs, with market shares ranging from 0 to 53.3% (December 2018). CONCLUSIONS These results may encourage decision makers in England to promote the use of best-value treatments in primary care and to reevaluate variation across CCGs.",2020,Endocrinology & Metabolism,0
Exploring the 'grey areas' of state-society interaction in food sovereignty construction: the battle for Venezuela's seed law,Seed laws; state-society relations; Venezuela; food sovereignty; bottom-up policy-making; PERSPECTIVES; HISTORY; BRAZIL,"In late December 2015, amidst plummeting oil prices, highly politicized food shortages, and an all-around tense political climate in Venezuela, an unexpected event took place in the country's National Assembly just days before a major shift in its political leadership. A new seed law was passed, with provisions including bans on genetically modified seeds and the patenting of life forms, recognition of both formal and informal seed systems, and protections for the seeds of the country's peasant, Indigenous, and Afro-descendant communities. The processes behind the Law's passage were long, messy, dynamic and contentious, with unanticipated twists and turns, betrayals and alliances. This article shares an 'intimate perspective' into these processes, as described by those directly involved in them, and as seen through the combined analytical lenses of a historical, relational and interactive approach to food sovereignty construction. This includes an exploration of the shifting of roles across state-society lines; the interaction of threats and opportunities as catalysts for collective action; and incremental shifts in power as social movements engage strategically in different types of spaces, including inside, outside, through and between formal structures of the state. Such an approach complicates simplified narratives around state co-optation of movements on the one hand or idealized depictions of state-society synergy on the other, revealing the many shades of grey involved. The aim is to contribute new insights into the complexities of state-society relations in the construction of food sovereignty, and into bottom-up policy-making processes more generally.",2020,Anthropology; Development Studies,0
Digital Development Influencing Mechanism on Green Innovation Performance: A Perspective of Green Innovation Network,Digital systems; Green products; Environmental monitoring; Costs; Electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Research and development; Digital development; green innovation network; green innovation performance; new energy vehicles; ,"Digital development offers groundbreaking opportunities for environmental monitoring and protection, as well as for maintaining the overall health of the planet. Through judicious use, global sustainability can be promoted. This study constructs a green innovation network using the green innovation patent data of listed companies of new energy vehicles as empirical evidence. The influence of network structure on green innovation performance is analyzed, and network structure indicators with positive effects are identified. The Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) is used to analyze the evolutionary influence on the structure of green innovation network from network configuration as endogenous attributes and digital characteristics as exogenous attributes. We explore the mechanism of improving green innovation performance by digitalization through enhancing the development of green innovation network. The results show that the enhanced structure of innovation network has a significant positive effect on the improvement of green innovation performance. Both star  and closed triangle  network configurations can promote the establishment of green innovation cooperation. In terms of digital characteristics, digital technology and digital organization can positively promote the development of green innovation network, while digital environment does not show a significant facilitating effect. Because of the tremendous expansion of digital technology adoption and the necessary infrastructure, enterprises can bridge the technology gap by optimizing digital technology and digital organizations. Enterprises can improve green innovation performance by optimizing digital technology and digital organization to promote the establishment of green innovation cooperation. The government should avoid the ineffective empowerment of digital environment construction on green innovation performance.",2023,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,0

PDL has been used clinically for treating inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. However, due to the complex composition of PDL, its potential anti-inflammation and the mechanism remain unknown. To identify the mechanism of the PDL in the treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury of mice. The mice models of lung injury were established and the changes of biochemical indices in serum and histopathology were detected to explore the effects of PDL. The approach of GC-MS metabolomics was used to find more significant metabolites, and the metabolic pathways were enriched through MetaboAnalyst. Then network analysis was applied to visualize the protein related to the important metabolites, merging into a protein-metabolite network via Cytoscape. The treatment of PDL could attenuate LPS-induced histopathological damage of lung tissues, followed by reducing pro-inflammation mediators including IL-10, TNF-a and NF-kappa B in serum. 11 potential metabolites were identified in lung tissue through metabolomics, which were significantly regulated to recover by PDL treatment. The correlated network was constructed by integrating potential metabolites and pathways. Aspartate and L-cysteine were selected as key metabolites and correlated proteins such as IL4I1 and ASPA were speculated as the potential target to treat LPS-induced lung injury using PDL. These results demonstrated that PDL might prevent the pathological process of lung injury through regulating the disturbed protein-metabolite network.",2020,Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

Thus, in silico bioprospecting emerges as an efficient strategy for discovering new enzyme candidates. A new program called ProspectBIO was developed for this purpose as it can find non-annotated sequences by searching for homologs of a model enzyme directly in genomes. Here we describe the ProspectBIO software methodology and the experimental validation by prospecting for novel lipases by sequence homology to Candida antarctica lipase B (CaLB) and conserved motifs. As expected, we observed that the new bioprospecting software could find more sequences (1672) than a conventional similarity-based search in a protein database (733). Additionally, the absence of patent protection was introduced as a criterion resulting in the final selection of a putative lipase-encoding gene from Ustilago hordei (UhL). Expression of UhL in Pichia pastoris resulted in the production of an enzyme with activity towards a tributyrin substrate. The recombinant enzyme activity levels were 4-fold improved when lowering the temperature and increasing methanol concentrations during the induction phase in shake-flask cultures. Protein sequence alignment and structural modeling showed that the recombinant enzyme has high similarity and capability of adjustment to the structure of CaLB. However, amino acid substitutions identified in the active pocket entrance may be responsible for the differences in the substrate specificities of the two enzymes. Thus, the ProspectBIO software allowed the finding of a new promising lipase for biotechnological application without the need for laborious and expensive conventional bioprospecting experimental steps.",2023,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0
Scientometric analysis and perspective of IgY technology study,scientometric analysis; egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY); IgY technology; poultry; EGG-YOLK ANTIBODIES; PASSIVE-IMMUNIZATION; CHICKEN; HEN; PROTECTION,"Egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) is a class of antibody that is produced in birds against pathogens. Therefore, hyperimmunization of birds can produce a specific antibody in the egg against target antigen for a wide range of applications in diagnostic, prophylactic or treatment in human and veterinary medicine which is known today as IgY technology. Until now, the number of articles, patents and clinical studies on IgY technology has increased significantly. Hence, there is a fact that scientometric studies are needed to gain a deeper understanding of the research for the commercialization of IgY technology. Until now, no scientometric research has been directed toward IgY technology. In view of this, we conducted scientometric analysis in the WoS database. A total of 1,029 IgY-related papers were obtained including 981 journal articles and 48 reviews. The visualization of this literature showed an increasing trend in the number of IgY-related publications over the 4 decades, especially after 2008 to 2021. China, the United States, Canada, Japan, and Germany had the largest number of publications, with 220, 148, 91, 76, and 72, respectively. Among all the research institutions, Dalian University of Technology, Alberta University and Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University published the most of the articles, respectively. Among authors, Dr. Xiaoying Zhang had the highest number of publications with 21. The top most cited publications were from Dr. da Silva with 38 citations. Keywords co-occurrence network analysis showed that the correlation between different keywords is large, especially IgY, antibodies and immunoglobulin which is consistent with the rapid increase in the number of publications.

Probiotic strains used are Bifidobacterium BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, Lactobacillus delbrueckii LBY-27, Lactobacillus paracasei LC-01, and Streptococcus thermophilus STY-31. Thirty rats randomly assigned to five groups were used in the experiment. Groups A to C received 1 x 10(9) CFU, 5 x 10(9) CFU, and 10 x 10(9) CFU of the multi-strain probiotics daily and respectively from day 0 post-supplementation (PS) to termination. Group D and E were the infected and uninfected controls respectively. On day seven PS, groups A to D were challenged intraperitoneally with approximately 1 x 10(6) trypanosomes. Parasitemia, nitric oxide level, hematobiochemical parameters, and antibody titer to heterologous antigen stimulation were monitored post-infection. By days 7 and 16 PS, probiotics-treated groups had significantly lower (p < 0.05) mean creatinine concentration than the controls; however, on day 7 PS, there were no significant variations in the leukocyte counts (LC), total erythrocyte counts (TEC), and the packed cell volume (PCV) in all experimental groups. Following infection, by day 16 PS, the pre-patent period, parasitemia levels, and antibody titer were similar in all infected groups. Furthermore, the probiotics-treated groups and the infected control had significantly lower PCV, TEC, and LC values when compared to the uninfected control, and probiotics treated groups (A and C) had only marginally lower nitric oxide levels than the infected control. Treatment with the probiotic strains gave a creatinine-lowering effect, was innocuous to the hematopoietic system, but was not sufficiently immunostimulatory in trypanosomosis.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology,0
Fertilization potential test of sperm from nano monoclonal antibody injected goats,Sex selection; Dairy goats; Nano monoclonal antibody; In vitro fertilization; SEXED SEMEN,"Controlling the sex of an animal's offspring has long been the dream of most livestock producers. To produce a very higher percentage of X chromosome bearing sperm, calcium phosphate nano monoclonal antibody (NMATM) against Guanzhong dairy goat sperm epitope was developed in advance, and the detailed development technique has been applied for patent protection. The present study focused on the fertilization potential detection of sperm which was treated by testis injection of NMATM to implementing sex selection of Guanzhong dairy goat. Results showed that no significant differences in sperm viability, sperm velocities, acrosomal integrity and plasma membrane integrity, although the volume and density of a single ejaculate were slightly lower in goats from the NMATM injection group than those of the control group. From the 6th to 30th week following NMATM injection, the percentage of X chromosome bearing sperm was more than 90 %; at the week 40th, it dropped to 88 %. After the second NMATM injection performed at the 40th week, over 90 % of sperm with X chromosome could be obtained again. Moreover, the in vitro fertilization capacity of sperm derived from NMATM injection was the same as that of the control group. No significant difference in pregnancy rates and kidding rates was observed following artificial insemination using sorted sperm versus unsorted sperm, but the proportion of female offspring was more than 90 %, which was significantly higher in the sex sorted group than that of the control group. The sex determination technique presented here can be mainly applied to facilitate the mass production of female Guanzhong dairy goats.",2021,Agriculture,0
Effects of novel brain-penetrating oxime acetylcholinesterase reactivators on sarin surrogate-induced changes in rat brain gene expression,acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; neuroprotection; organophosphate; oxime reactivators; sarin surrogate; ,"Past assassinations and terrorist attacks demonstrate the need for a more effective antidote against nerve agents and other organophosphates (OP) that cause brain damage through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Our lab has invented a platform of phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes (US patent 9,277,937) that demonstrate the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier in in vivo rat tests with a sarin surrogate nitrophenyl isopropyl methylphosphonate (NIMP) and provide evidence of brain penetration by reducing cessation time of seizure-like behaviors, accumulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and hippocampal neuropathology, as opposed to the currently approved oxime, 2-pyridine aldoxime methyl chloride (2-PAM). Using two of the novel oximes (Oximes 1 and 20), this project examined whether gene expression changes might help explain this protection. Expression changes in the piriform cortex were examined using polymerase chain reaction arrays for inflammatory cytokines and receptors. The hippocampus was examined via quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the expression of immediate-early genes involved in brain repair (Bdnf), increasing neurotoxicity (Fos), and apoptosis control (Jdp2, Bcl2l1, Bcl2l11). In the piriform cortex, NIMP significantly stimulated expression for the macrophage inflammatory proteins CCL4, IL-1A, and IL-1B. Oxime 20 by itself elicited the most changes. When it was given therapeutically post-NIMP, the largest change occurred: a 310-fold repression of the inflammatory cytokine, CCL12. In the hippocampus, NIMP increased the expression of the neurotoxicity marker Fos and decreased the expression of neuroprotective Bdnf and antiapoptotic Bcl2l1. Compared with 2-PAM, Oxime 20 stimulated Bcl2l1 expression more and returned expression closer to the vehicle control values.",2021,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Toxicology,0
Load balancing and neural dynamic model to optimize replicator dynamics controllers for vibration reduction of highway bridge structures,Replicator dynamics; Game theory; Neural dynamic; Load balancing; Data-driven control; Structural control; CONTROL STRATEGIES; MASS DAMPERS; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; DESIGN,"Earthquakes cause irreparable damages to the built environment, which has led bridge engineers to develop structural control systems to mitigate damage and improve vibration reduction in real-time. Among control systems, base isolation is one of the most commonly used passive control strategies for seismic protection of civil structures. Yet, it lacks real-time adaptability, has lower energy dissipation, and poor performance during near-fault earthquakes. To overcome these limitations, a hybrid control system comprised of semiactive magneto-rheological (MR) dampers and passive base isolation bearings is installed at the deck and piers for vibration reduction of highway bridge structures. This paper, inspired by evolutionary game theory and artificial intelligence, proposes data-driven replicator dynamic control algorithms to distribute the command voltage to the current driver of the semi-active MR dampers. It incorporates a load balancing strategy to reallocate additional resources. To achieve a high-performance design of the game-theory-inspired controllers, a patented neural dynamic model is used to optimize the control parameters. The evaluation of the proposed methodology uses a benchmark control problem based on the 91/5 highway bridge in Southern California subjected to near-field earthquake accelerograms. The performance of five different proposed controllers is compared with conventional Lyapunov and fuzzy logic control algorithms using 21 performance criteria. Results show the load balancing capability of the proposed control algorithms to mitigate the vibrations experienced by the bridge structure and further increase the durability of semi-active devices. The novelty of the methodology impacts how game-theory controllers make control decisions among multiple devices in engineering problems.",2021,Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering,0
Efficacy of human HC016 cell transplants on neuroprotection and functional recovery in a rat model of acute spinal cord injury,cell therapy; human adipose mesenchymal stem cells; HC016 cell conditioning treatment; rat preclinical contusion model; spinal cord injury; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; HUMAN BONE-MARROW; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; STROMAL CELLS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; GAIT ANALYSIS; MECHANISMS; CONTUSION; THERAPY,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event with huge personal and social costs, for which there is no effective treatment. Cell therapy constitutes a promising therapeutic approach for SCI; however, its clinical potential is seriously limited by their low survival in the hostile conditions encompassing the acute phase of SCI. Human HC016 (hHC016) cells, generated from expanded human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) and pulsed with a patented protocol with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are expected to acquire improved resistance to oxidative environments which appears as a major limiting factor hampering the engrafting success. Our specific aim was to assess whether H2O2-pulsed hHC016 cells had an improved survival and thus therapeutic efficacy in a rat contusion model of acute SCI when grafted 48 hr after injury. Functional recovery was evaluated up to 56 days post-injury (dpi) by locomotor (open field test and CatWalk) and sensory (Von Frey and Hargreaves) tests. Besides, histological evaluation of transplanted cell survival and tissue protection/regeneration was also performed. Functional results showed a statistically significant improvement on locomotor recovery outcomes with hHC016 cells. Accordingly, superior cell survival in correlation with long-term neuroprotection, higher axonal regeneration, and reduced astroglial and microglial reactivity was also observed with hHC016 cells. These results demonstrate an enhanced survival capacity of hHC016 cells resulting in improved functional and histological outcomes as compared with hAMSCs, indicating that hHC016 cell transplants may constitute a promising cell therapy for acute SCI.",2020,Cell Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering,0
Navigating intellectual property challenges in China: Insights from RCEP and domestic factors,; PATENT; PERSPECTIVE; RIGHTS; LAW,"In a high-quality economic era, China needs innovative development. Intellectual property (IP) innovation and development are the first driving forces in China. At the same time, China has signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement (RCEP), which has had a significant impact on the development of China's IP law. Under the combination of these two factors, China's IP innovation and development environment are worth studying. This paper uses the factor analysis method from five dimensions, including initiatives for civic awareness, regional IP development foundation, legislative support, law enforcement measures, and judicial protection, to study the development environment of IP innovation in 31 provincial regions in China, in the past 3 years. It is found that IP development in various regions of China is insufficient in some way, and the scores of different provinces vary greatly, so it will inevitably affect the development of China's IP integrally and then affect the construction process of strong provinces and cities with intellectual property rights (IPR). The novelty of this research is its in-depth investigation into how the RCEP and global partnerships are influencing the transformation of China's intellectual property landscape. This transformation requires legal adjustments and underscores the importance of specialized IP judge training, alignment with international norms, and regional IP progress to realize China's ambition of becoming a dominant force in intellectual property. Combined with the fact that RCEP has come into effect in China and has had a significant impact, it is necessary to develop China's IP undertaking from legislative, judicial, law enforcement, and international cooperation aspects.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Overcoming barriers to breeding for increased lice resistance in farmed Atlantic salmon: A case study from Norway,Salmon lice; Genetic resistance; Atlantic salmon; Selective breeding; Policy instruments; Regulating gene editing; INFECTIOUS PANCREATIC NECROSIS; GENETIC-RESOURCES; AQUACULTURE; PROTECTION; ACCESS; CATTLE; GOALS; SALAR; LOUSE; SELECTION,"Lice is a persistent and major problem in the salmon aquaculture sector with serious environmental impacts and reducing growth potential and income of the salmon industry. This article discusses whether there is an untapped potential in breeding for improved lice resistant of Atlantic salmon. To this end, three sets of factors that may impact the state of breeding for lice resistance are examined, using document analysis and key actor interviews. First, our data material indicates that market-based factors will hardly stimulate this type of breeding, as the benefits from breeding for lice resistance is predominantly a public good, and because the polygenic nature of lice resistance does not enable patenting as a powerful instrument to secure private goods or privatize the benefits of genetic improvement. Second, the regulation of gene editing technologies is in flux, and increase the risk of investments in technologies as selective breeding that could handle the polygenic challenges of lice resistance. Finally, policy instruments aimed at stimulating relevant innovation has been applied generously for other types of innovations to deal with the lice problem. For instance, new technologies for delousing have resulted in increased treatments and caused higher stress and mortality the recent years. However, none of these have targeted major root causes of the salmon lice problem (e.g. big monocultures or susceptible fish) or been exploited by breeding actors. Seen from a social and environmental point of view this could paradoxically lead to increased demand for fish that better endures harsh delousing treatments rather than demand for more lice resistant fish.",2022,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,0
"Reducing Pangolin Demand by Understanding Motivations for Human Consumption in Guangdong, China",wildlife trade; pangolin; consumption willingness; species conservation; Guangdong province; SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; TRADE; WILDLIFE; BEHAVIOR; MEDICINE; MARKETS; SCALE,"Pangolins are some of the most trafficked mammals in the world. China is a major destination country for illegal wildlife trade and Guangdong Province is one of the areas of high domestic wildlife consumption. A willingness to consume lies at the root of the illegal wildlife trade. To understand the ideological roots of pangolin consumption, and to propose solutions, we conducted a consumption survey in 21 prefecture-level cities in Guangdong and have collected 1,957 valid questionnaires. In these questionnaires, 108 respondents (5.52%) who had consumed pangolin-related products, scales had been consumed by 61 respondents (3.12%), 58 respondents (2.96%) had consumed meat. We found that scale consumption was primarily motivated by disease treatment (80.43%). The main reason for meat consumption was accidental (44.83%), but among those who intentionally ate pangolin were motivated by curiosity (22.41%) or showing off (8.62%). Simultaneously, the respondents' future consumption willingness for medicinal purposes was more difficult to change than its use for other purposes. What's more, the public's insufficient understanding of the status of pangolins in China and weak legal awareness were potential reasons for pangolin consumption. In addition to classifying pangolins as Category I state-protected animals in China and strengthening penalties and enforcement, we recommend creating public awareness of the risk of zoonotic diseases, advocating for the use of alternative medicines in disease treatment and removing scales from ingredients in patented medicines, which will all act to reduce the demand for pangolins. We expect these actions to change public consumption behaviors and their collective understanding of pangolins, which improve pangolin protection efforts around the globe.",2020,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

In this paper, the term West Africa is used to designate the 15 countries that are members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the major regional organization in the area (The founding members of ECOWAS were: Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania [left 2002], Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Burkina Faso [which joined as Upper Volta]. Cape Verde joined in 1977). By reviewing relevant literature and theories, I propose that the human right to development as a differentiating paradigm may be applied in IP regulation, without compromising the requirement of non-discrimination in IP regimes. I argue that human rights linked to the food security should be differentiated from the proprietary rights granted in IP. After critical doctrinal analysis of West Africa's regional agreements related to IP rights and food security, I conclude that rather than maximising the adoption of the differentiation principle to advance the regions food security, these treaties are surprisingly less flexible than multilateral agreements, creating further challenges for food security in the region. Consequently, I propose an alternative regional framework for differentiation, that allows for differentiation between IP and human rights norms based on the instrumentalist approach to law, as being more suitable for advancing development and food security in West Africa.",2021,Government & Law,0
Uncovering the protective mechanism of Pien-Tze-Huang in rat with alcoholic liver injury based on cytokines analysis and untargeted metabonomics,Pien-Tze-Huang; Cytokines analysis; Untargeted metabonomics; Alcoholic liver injury; UHPLC-QTOF; MS; Pathway analysis; FATTY LIVER; SILYMARIN; DISEASE,"Pien-Tze-Huang (PTH) is a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine with excellent liver-protection effect. However, the mechanism of hepatoprotective action has not yet been entirely elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of protective effect of PTH on alcohol-induced liver injury in rats using cytokine analysis and untargeted metabolomics approaches. An alcoholic liver disease (ALD) model with SD rats was established, and PTH was administered according to the prescribed dose. The hepatoprotective effect of PTH was evaluated by pathological observation of liver tissue and changes in biochemical index activity and cytokines in serum. Serum samples were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-offlight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS), and differentially expressed metabolites were screened by multivariate statistical analysis. KEGG combined with metabolic pathway analysis were used to evaluate the underlying metabolic pathways. Results showed liver histopathology injury was attenuated. The levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha and NF-kappa B were significantly decreased in rats intervened with PTH groups, suggesting that it may alleviate inflammation via suppressing the inflammatory cytokines signaling pathway. Eighty differentially expressed metabolites were found and identified. Pathway analysis indicated that the hepatoprotective effects of PTH occurred through the regulation of inflammatory cytokines signaling pathway, primary bile acid biosynthesis, vitamin B6 metabolism pathway, cholesterol metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism. PTH showed favorable hepatoprotective effect through multiple pathways. This study has great importance in fully revealing the mechanism of hepatoprotective action and can help improve the clinical application of PTH.",2023,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,0

This paper further aims to study the impact of accounting system reform on corporate value.Design/methodology/approachThis study takes China's A-share listed corporates as a sample and uses the exogenous policy shock of the implementation of the New Accounting Standards in 2007 to design the identification strategy of propensity score matching and difference-in-differences method. By comparing the differences between the innovation level of corporates in high-tech industries and non-high-tech industries before and after the implementation of the New Accounting Standards, the impact of the accounting system reform on corporates' innovative behavior can be identified.FindingsResults show that compared with corporates in traditional industries, high-tech corporates obtained higher patent output after the implementation of the New Accounting Standards. This reform mainly affects corporate innovation by improving corporate risk-taking. In addition, this paper finds that the reform of the accounting system has increased the market value of high-tech corporates in the long run.Originality/valueThis study provides new empirical evidence for addressing the insufficient innovation incentives for market entities and enriches the existing literature on the economic effects of the change of accounting systems and the influencing factors of corporate innovative behavior from the accounting system perspective.",2024,Computer Science,0
Synthesis and properties of biomass polyether diols based polyurethane dispersions by a solvent-free process,Biomass; Polyurethane dispersion; Solvent-free; Environment-friendly; Textile coating; PERFORMANCE; COATINGS; CASTOR,"Environmental protection is a global objective and a key factor in future development. Decreasing volatile organic compounds and replacing fossil-based materials are considered huge challenges in the ecofriendly polyurethane (PU) industry. Although replacing solvent-based PU by water-based polyurethane dispersions (PUDs) is crucial, PUDs still contain some organic solvents, which should be removed by vacuum evaporation. In addition, the use of biobased materials derived from renewable sources instead of fossil-based materials is considered an ecofriendly technique. In this study, we synthesized biobased PUDs with a biomass polyether diol (polypropanediol H1000) through a patented solvent-free process without the addition of any organic solvent. We synthesized a series of solvent-free biobased PUDs by using H1000 incorporated with fossil polyether diol (poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol T1000) with various biocontents of formulation (60, 50, 40, 30, and 0 wt.%). When using biobased 60 wt.% PUD, Bio60-H100, the adhesion force is higher than fossil materials source, Bio0-H0 by cross-cut and scrub test. This is because of the high ether group concentration and increased number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in H1000. As indicated by stress-strain curves, the toughness of the PU films from hard to soft when the ether group concentration of PU soft segments increased. In addition, the solvent-free biobased PUDs were flexible, exhibited superior softness, and demonstrated increased tear strength on recycled polyester fabric with a fluoride-free water-repellent agent (C0 W/R). In summary, we developed a series of high-biocontent environment-friendly solvent-free PUDs with favorable storage stability, which can be used in textile coating in the sustainable fabric industry.",2022,Polymer Science,0

Soluble endoglin (sEng) shed from the extracellular domain of the entire endoglin molecule blocks endothelial protection mediated by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). The reactive hyperemia index (RHI), which is determined by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT), is a new index with which to evaluate ED. This study determined the changes in serum sEng levels in newly-diagnosed (untreated) T2DM patients and the correlation with the RHI. The T2DM group included 34 newly-diagnosed T2DM patients, while the control group included 53 healthy adults. The clinical data from the two groups were evaluated retrospectively. The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA) and the ankle-brachial index (ABI) of both legs were used to assess structural vascular changes. The serum sEng level was determined using an ELISA kit. Endothelial function was assessed using RH-PAT and the RHI was computed. The serum sEng level in the T2DM group was significantly greater than the control group, although the RHI was significantly lower in the T2DM group (p < 0.05). The serum sEng level was negatively correlated with the RHI in T2DM patents (r = 0.354, p = 0.041). The serum sEng level, CCA-IMT, and ABI were not significantly correlated with T2DM (p > 0.05). In summary, among newly-diagnosed T2DM patients, the serum sEng levels were inversely correlated with the RHI, and an elevated sEng level may be associated with ED.",2023,Endocrinology & Metabolism,0

Indeed, the soil is considered the main habitat and reservoir of Metarhizium spp., which may be a plant-beneficial microorganism due to its lifestyle as an endophyte and/or rhizosphere-competent fungus. This key role of Metarhizium spp. for eco-sustainable agriculture highlights the priority of developing proper monitoring tools not only to follow the presence of the fungus in the soil and to correlate it with its performance against Tephritid preimaginals but also for risk assessment studies for patenting and registering biocontrol strains. The present study aimed at understanding the population dynamics of M. brunneum strain EAMb 09/01-Su, which is a candidate strain for olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae (Rossi, 1790) preimaginal control in the soil, when applied to the soil at the field using different formulations and propagules. For this, strain-specific DNA markers were developed and used to track the levels of EAMb 09/01-Su in the soil of 4 field trials. The fungus persists over 250 days in the soil, and the levels of the fungus remained higher when applied as an oil-dispersion formulation than when applied as a wettable powder or encapsulated microsclerotia. Peak concentrations of EAMb 09/01-Su depend on the exogenous input and weakly on environmental conditions. These results will help us to optimize the application patterns and perform accurate risk assessments during further development of this and other entomopathogenic fungus-based bioinsecticides.",2023,Microbiology; Mycology,0

Mothers' choice of health management services for under-five children with common illnesses: evaluating social workers' impact in Nigerian health sector,Choice; health management; mothers; under-five children; social workers; CARE,"IntroductionEvery child deserves the right to life. In Nigeria like other African countries, a high burden of child mortality prevails. Attaining a low-mortality rate of children entails that mothers who are the primary caregivers are in the best position to provide quality healthcare management.MethodWith the phenomenological approach in qualitative research, the researchers sourced data using Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and In-Depth Interviews (IDI) from 38 mothers of various categories. The participants were purposively selected from four government and mission health institutions in a semi-urban Nsukka town, Enugu State. Data were analyzed thematically.FindingsResults revealed that mothers utilize health institutions including government, mission, private, pharmacies and patent medicine vendors when seeking healthcare for their children. Their inability to recognize potential life-threatening conditions is the leading factor in increasing child mortality. Findings show that because participants were concerned about financial challenges; they were ready to adopt traditional medicine as an alternative to modern medicine. The study showed evidence of unsafe strategies mothers adopt for the health management of their under-five children with common illnesses. Participants indicated little knowledge of social workers' engagement in health institutions.ConclusionHealthy living is essential in the protection from illnesses. Since under-five children are vulnerable to illnesses, their mothers should provide them with quality healthcare management. The study recommends that social workers' engagement with health providers and users in semi-urban societies could help propagate healthcare awareness and strategies in mothers' choice of health management for under-five children in Nigeria. Overall, adequate health policy consideration should be given to all under-five children in Nigeria.",2024,Social Work,0
Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair based on pre- and postoperative evaluation of the artery of Adamkiewicz,Thoracoabdominal aortic repair; Artery of Adamkiewicz; Spinal cord injury; Computed tomography; SPINAL-CORD PROTECTION; PREOPERATIVE DEMONSTRATION; DEEP HYPOTHERMIA; SURGERY; IDENTIFICATION; ANGIOGRAPHY; STRATEGY; OUTCOMES,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience with thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair based on the pre- and postoperative evaluation of the artery of Adamkiewicz (AKA). METHODS: Between April 2017 and May 2021, 32 patients who underwent thoracoabdominal aortic repair underwent pre- and postoperative multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) for AKA evaluation. Based on the identification of the AKA on preoperative MDCT, only 1 critical segmental artery was reattached to the AKA (CSA-AKA). Postoperative MDCT was used to evaluate the patency of the reattached CSA-AKA. RESULTS: Pre- and postoperative MDCT helped identify and visualize the AKA in all patients (100%). In 8 patients, alternative continuity to the AKA developed through collateral circulation. The total number of CSA-AKA with collateral circulation was 48 among the 32 cases; the number of reattached segmental arteries per case was 1.3 +/- 0.9 (range, 0-4). The overall rate of patency of the reattached CSA-AKA was 53% (23/43). Three patients exhibited spinal cord injuries (paraplegia, 2; paraparesis, 1). In the 2 paraplegia cases exhibiting partial or complete occlusion of the reattached CSA-AKA, the development of collateral circulation was not visualized via postoperative MDCT. In the paraparesis case, postoperative MDCT helped visualize the development of collateral circulation to the CSA-AKA, resulting in full recovery at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that spinal cord injuries do not occur in the presence of a patent preoperatively identified CSA-AKA or the development of collateral circulation. Pre- and postoperative identification of collateral pathways to the AKA may help reveal paraplegia risk factors.",2022,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery,0

Despite very positive results, little is known regarding its effect on the evolution of the indigenous bacterial communities, specially under hot and humid tropical conditions where proliferation of microorganisms is favored, as it is the case of the Maya area. Here, we studied changes in bacterial diversity of severely degraded tuff stone and lime plaster at the archeological Maya site of Copan (Honduras) after treatment with the patented sterile M-3P nutritional solution. High-throughput sequencing by Illumina MiSeq technology shows significant changes in the bacterial population of the treated stones, enhancing the development of Arthrobacter, Micrococcaceae, Nocardioides, Fictibacillus, and Streptomyces, and, in one case, Rubrobacter (carved stone blocks at Structure 18). In the lime plaster, Arthrobacter, Fictibacillus, Bacillus, Agrococcus, and Microbacterium dominated after treatment. Most of these detected genera have been shown to promote calcium carbonate biomineralization, thus implying that the novel bio-conservation treatment would be effective. Remarkably, the treatment induced the reduction or complete disappearance of deleterious acid-producing bacteria such as Marmoricola or the phylum Acidobacteria. The outcome of this study demonstrates that such a bio-conservation treatment can safely and effectively be applied on temples, sculptures and stuccos of the Maya area and, likely, in other hot and humid environments.",2020,Microbiology,0
"Farm-saved seed, royalty rates, and innovation in plant breeding",farm-saved seeds; intellectual property rights; plant breeders' rights; royalty rates; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PROTECTION; INCENTIVES; PATENTS; PIRACY,"Seed innovation is one major factor for improving agricultural productivity. For some self-pollinated varieties, such as wheat, farmers have the option to buy certified seed from seed dealers or to use their own farm-saved seed. Historically, farmers could use farm-saved seeds for free, which led to reduced incentives to innovate for private breeding companies. In recent decades, several countries have established different royalty systems for farm-saved seeds to favor research investment. We developed a theoretical model to compare these different systems. We compared six stylized systems by analyzing their impact on incentives to innovate, as well as production efficiencies at both the seed and agricultural production levels. Our findings indicate that royalty systems allowing for a certain proportion of farm-saved seeds result in improved welfare. The systems that lead to the highest total welfare levels are those in which the royalty level on farm-saved seeds is regulated. This includes systems where the royalty is either directly defined by a regulator (as in the French or UK systems) or imposed to match the royalty level of the certified seeds (as in the Australian system). The Australian system performs better under high research costs. Conversely, under low research costs, the best system is either the French or the UK system, depending on the relative cost of producing farm-saved seeds versus certified seeds. In conclusion, it is possible to design efficient royalty systems to create and produce innovation, in a context where farmers can self-produce this innovation.",2024,Agriculture; Business & Economics,0

A t-Branch stent graft was used in 2 patients, and a physician-modified thoracic stent graft with a branch was used in 1 patient. Eight branches and 4 fenestrations were used for the preservation of 12 SAs. Four fenestrations and 1 branch for the SAs were not bridged and were left for perfusion of the corresponding SAs. Technical success was achieved in 10 of 11 (91%) patients. No early mortality occurred. Early morbidities included renal insufficiency without dialysis in 1 patient and partially delayed paraplegia in 1 patient. Before discharge, computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed patency of all the SAs. The median follow-up duration was 30 months (range, 10-88 months). Late death occurred in 1 patient. Two SAs were occluded in 1 patient with 2 unstented fenestrations, as determined using 1-year follow-up CTA. This patient did not develop spinal cord ischemia (SCI). Other SAs remained patent during follow-up. One patient with a type IIIc endoleak was treated by relining of bridging stents.Conclusions: Endovascular preservation of SAs with F/B-EVAR for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm is feasible and safe in select patients and may add to preventive measures for SCI.",2023,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology",0
The EAES intellectual property awareness survey,Intellectual property; Invention; Patent; Public disclosure; Employees' invention; Medical device; ,"Introduction The protection of intellectual property (IP) is one of the fundamental elements in the process of medical device development. The significance of IP, however, is not well understood among clinicians and researchers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current status of IP awareness and IP-related behaviors among EAES members. Methods A web-based survey was conducted via questionnaires sent to EAES members. Data collected included participant demographics, level of understanding the need, new ideas and solutions, basic IP knowledge, e.g., employees' inventions and public disclosure, behaviors before and after idea disclosures. Results One hundred and seventy-nine completed forms were obtained through an email campaign conducted twice in 2019 (response rate = 4.8%). There was a dominancy in male, formally-trained gastrointestinal surgeons, working at teaching hospitals in European countries. Of the respondents, 71% demonstrated a high level of understanding the needs (frustration with current medical devices), with 66% developing specific solutions by themselves. Active discussion with others was done by 53%. Twenty-one percent of respondents presented their ideas at medical congresses, and 12% published in scientific journals. Only 20% took specific precautions or appropriate actions to protect their IPs before these disclosures. Conclusions The current level of awareness of IP and IP-related issues is relatively low among EAES members. A structured IP training program to gain basic IP knowledge and skill should be considered a necessity for clinicians. These skills would serve to prevent the loss of legitimate IP rights and avoid failure in the clinical implementation of innovative devices for the benefit of patients.",2022,Surgery,0
"Nanotechnologies for testing and diagnostics of materials, constructions and elements of engineering systems of buildings from them with fire retardant coatings. Part 1",fire retardant coatings; degree of fire resistance; materials and structures; quality of fire retardant coatings; durability of fire retardant coatings; thermo-electro-acoustic method; heat conductivity; thermal diffusivity; heat capacity; aging of fire retardant coatings; ,"Introduction. The aim of the study was to optimize the quality control of fire retardant coatings (FRC) during their production and use. The results of a comparative analysis of the consequences of fires and their causes with the parameter of fire resistance of objects indicate that the number of fires and damage from them in buildings of the first degree of fire resistance is almost an order of magnitude smaller than in buildings of the second degree of fire resistance. Consequently, increasing the fire resistance of building materials and structures is the way to radically reduce fires and losses from them. Methods and materials. Based on a system analysis of existing fire protection technologies for building materials made of wood, metals, rubber and polymers, nanotechnologies were developed to determine the stability of samples with an FRC on the baro-electro-thermo-acoustic (BETA) analyzer and create their images for further diagnosis of their aging at the constructions and operation facility. The novelty of the study is protected by patents of the Russian Federation. Results and discussion. The obtained results consist in the refinement of computational algorithms for the FRC in the BETA analyzer, as well as in the development of a portable automated complex, which allows to determine the stage of aging of the FRC on these materials, and, consequently, their durability and update time. This conclusion is based, firstly, on the results of the development of a thermo-electro-dilatometer crucible for controlling liquid and viscous materials by the authors of the float design, which will make it possible to control the FRC characteristics during their production, and secondly, to carry out express control after filling them in containers (polymer, metal, glass) without opening it and thirdly, due to the recognition of these images using thermo-electro-measurements of the FRC using special probes connected to a portable automated system. Conclusion. The results obtained make it possible to arm with portable automated systems not only construction and fire control authorities, but also manufacturers of emergency protection products. This will allow, according to the authors, to fundamentally solve the problems of quality and durability of FRC, but the main thing is to guarantee the stability of the protected materials and structures from them.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0

The Importance of Being First: Economic and Non-economic Dimensions of Inventorship in American and German Law,; ,"This Article examines the right to be acknowledged as the first inventor of a new technology in patent law. Technological inventions usually result from cumulative research and development, and several people sometimes arrive at the same invention almost simultaneously. However, only one person is usually considered to be the inventor,  and receives all the credit and honor.This Article focuses on the legal systems of Germany and the United States, comparing how they conceptualize the right to be seen as inventor. These systems have developed in substantially different philosophical and cultural climates: while the German legal system has been deeply influenced by Kantian and Hegelian thought, the American legal system has been inspired more strongly by liberal and utilitarian ideas. These two schools of philosophical thought have different perspectives on the relationship between personal identity and work; while the German tradition emphasizes the deeply personal relation between individuals and their work, the Anglo-Saxon approach is, in general, more instrumentalist and utilitarian with regard to work.One way in which these differences express themselves is the different ways in which the right to be acknowledged as the first inventor is understood and regulated. The right to be acknowledged as the first inventor is deeply connected with one's identity as a professional, whether an engineer, technician, or scientist. On the other hand, this right does not necessarily have pecuniary significance. Hence, the protection of the right to be considered as the first inventor allows a glimpse into the different visions of identity and work found in these legal systems.This Article examines to what extent German and American legal systems recognize and protect the right to be perceived as the first inventor. It demonstrates that the two legal systems differ profoundly in the ways they perceive and protect the right to be considered as the first inventor. True to its visions of professional dignity, German law carefully protects this right, independently from any pecuniary interests. In contrast, American law grants a remarkably weak protection to the right to be considered as the first inventor, focusing primarily on its monetary aspects. Hence, one can here discover different visions of the role of individuals in society, and specifically of the role of individuals as creators and not just consumers. What is at stake here is whether questions of honor, dignity, and symbolic property, above and beyond material benefits, are recognized as playing a role in the economic system.",2022,Government & Law,0
In vitro dentine tubule occlusion by a novel toothpaste containing calcium silicate and sodium phosphate,Calcium silicate; Dentine; Hypersensitivity; Hydroxyapatite; Toothpaste; ,"Objectives: To investigate the deposition, formation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) and acid resistance of dentine surfaces following brushing with a toothpaste containing calcium silicate and sodium phosphate (CSSP) and fluoride in vitro. Methods: Human dentine specimens were brushed with a slurry of CSSP toothpaste followed by exposure to simulated oral fluid (SOF) in two in vitro studies, with a silica-based non-occluding toothpaste as control. The surface and tubule deposits were analysed after 14 cycles with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). In a third study, dentine specimens were additionally exposed to citric acid erosive challenges for 30, 300 or 600 s after 2, 6, 10 and 14 cycles of SOF and either the CSSP toothpaste or a positive control toothpaste containing calcium sodium phosphosilicate and fluoride. The level of tubule occlusion was evaluated using SEM. Results: The SEM analyses indicated complete coverage of the dentine surface following 14 cycles of brushing with CSSP toothpaste with no observable patent tubules, in contrast to the non-occluding control toothpaste. The TEM and SAED analyses confirmed the deposited material on the surface and within tubules was HAP. The deposited material from CSSP toothpaste was more acid resistant than the deposited material from the positive control toothpaste at all time points and acid exposure levels (p< 0.05). Conclusions: The CSSP toothpaste fully occluded dentine tubules and formed the mineral HAP. The dentine deposition on and within dentine tubules was resilient to acid erosive challenges. Clinical significance: A novel toothpaste containing CSSP can form HAP on dentine surfaces and within tubules. The potential of this technology is for a novel approach for the protection of dentine surfaces to acid challenges and the reduction of dentine hypersensitivity.",2020,"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",0
Type A Aortic Dissection After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting,Aneurysm; Dissecting; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Artery Disease; Reoperation; DEL NIDO CARDIOPLEGIA; CARDIAC-SURGERY,"Objective: Rare disease Background: Aortic dissection is rare after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but it is a potentially fatal complication of cardiac surgery. Reoperation may pose problems with thoracotomy, adhesiolysis, and myocardial protection. No standard treatment guidelines exist for chronic aortic dissection after CABG. We present a case of chronic type A aortic dissection after cardiac surgery, which was successfully treated. Case Report: A 65-year-old female patient presented with a medical background of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. No connective tissue disorders were diagnosed. The aortic valve was tricuspid. Three years ago, she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting involving 4 branches at a different medical facility. She reported chest pain weeks after bypass surgery, which gradually increased. Aortic dissection was observed in the latest contrast-enhanced CT scan, beginning from just above the sinotubular junction and reaching below the brachiocephalic trunk. Two grafts from the saphenous vein were patent, and 1 was lying just below the sternum. Cardiopulmonary support was initiated by cannulating the right femoral artery and vein. An opening in the ascending aorta exposed an intimal tear near the proximal anastomosis of the 2 great saphenous vein grafts. Antegrade del Nido cardioplegia was given through native ostia and functional bypass grafts. Proximal and then distal anastomosis of the graft prosthesis was performed. A new venous graft was anastomosed to the apical part of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). This saphenous vein and the buttons of the 2 previous vein grafts were anastomosed to the prosthesis. The patient was successfully liberated from the heartlung machine and exhibited favorable cardiac function in the postoperative period. Conclusions: Initial peripheral cannulation with a half dose of heparin provides a relatively bloodless and secure re-entry sternotomy. del Nido cardioplegia is easy to implement, is safe, and gives surgeons enough time without interruptions to perform complex procedures.",2024,General & Internal Medicine,0
Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid Attenuates LPS-Induced Acute Lung Injury by Modulating Short-Chain Fatty Acid Levels and TLR4/NF-κB p65 Pathway,; ,"Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid (HZOL) is a classic Chinese patent medicine used in China for more than 1,000 years in treating gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases. Clinically applied HZOL in early respiratory disease stages can reduce the proportion of lung infection patients that progress to severe acute lung injury (ALI). However, few pharmacological studies evaluated its level of protection against ALI. We explored mechanisms of HZOL against ALI by employing network pharmacology, molecular docking, and rat experiments. Firstly, network pharmacology prediction and published biological evaluation of active ingredients of HZOL suggested that HZOL exerted the protective effect in treating ALI mainly in the areas of regulation of cell adhesion, immune response, and inflammatory response and closely related to the NF-kappa B pathway. Secondly, molecular docking results demonstrated that imperatorin and isoimperatorin combined well with targets in the NF-kappa B pathway. Finally, ALI rats induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were used to validate prediction after pretreatment with HZOL for 2 weeks. Results confirmed that lung and colon injury occurred in ALI rats. Furthermore, HZOL exerts anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-induced ALI and gut injury by repairing lung and colon pathology, reducing and alleviating pulmonary edema, inhibiting abnormal enhancement of thymus and spleen index, modulating hematologic indices, and increasing levels of total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the cecum. Additionally, abnormal accumulation of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was significantly reduced after pretreating with HZOL. Furthermore, HZOL downregulated the expression of TLR4, CD14, and MyD88 and phosphorylation of NF-kappa B p65 in lung tissue. Altogether, HZOL was found to exert an anti-inflammatory effect regulation by increasing levels of SCFAs, inhibiting the accumulation of inflammatory cytokines, and attenuating the activation of the TLR4/NF-kappa B p65 pathway. Our study provided experimental evidences for the application of HZOL in preventing and treating ALI.",2023,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Research & Experimental Medicine,0

Objective: In this study, we investigated the cell-mediated immune response of a genetically inactivated protein containing the S1 subunit of pertussis toxin (PTS1) without and with the Listeriolysin O (LLO-PTS1), developed by the researchers (the authors of this study), in comparison with current wP and aP vaccines in the mice model. Methods: Thirty-six female NMRI mice aged 8 to 12 weeks (25 +/- 5 g) were divided into six groups including control (n=6), and five treated groups (n=6/each). Treated groups comprising recombinant PTS1, recombinant fusion LLO-PTS1, aP, wP, and sham (phosphate-buffered saline) were injected intraperitoneally whereas the control group did not receive anything. After 60 days, the serum levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-17 cytokines (as the T-helper 1, 2, and 17 responses, respectively) were evaluated by mouse ELISA Kit. Results: Our findings showed LLO-PTS1 significantly increased IL-17 and IL-4 cytokines compared with wP and aP vaccines (superiority). IFN-gamma failed to significantly increase in the LLO-PTS1 group compared to others but it was non-inferior to standard vaccines (non-inferiority). Conclusion: Our alum free mono-component monovalent recombinant fusion protein (LLO-PTS1), registered as a patent in the www.iripo.ssaa.ir, could bear the capacity to stimulate the Th-1 response similar to wP and aP vaccines (non-inferiority) in the mice model. In addition, it showed better results in Th-17 and Th-2 response (superiority).

Research on a Ship Deflection Anti-Collision Method Based on a Water-Jet Interference Flow Field,ship-bridge anti-striking; water jet; ship yaw torque; tracks line; nozzle pressure; COMPOSITES; PROTECTION,"Currently, water jets are mainly used in the fields of mechanical processing and mining collection. This paper creatively introduces them to the field of safety assurance for inland navigation. Compared with the traditional bridge anti-striking methods such as intelligent early warning and passive anti-striking, this method can form an interference zone by changing the water flow conditions in the local bridge water areas, causing the yawing moment of the yaw ship to change, thereby causing the ship's course to change, and thus guiding the ship to move away from the bridge pier to realize active anti-striking of the ship. In this paper, a combination of generalized model testing and numerical simulation was used to study the effects of different nozzle pressures and different ship pier distances of the water-jet generator on the trajectory and drift angle of the stalled ship. The results showed that the numerical simulation was in good agreement with the model test results. Within the interference zone, the distance between the ship and the pier increased rapidly after the action of the disturbance zone to 9.1, 5.8, and 6.2 times the ship's width, respectively, reaching a safe distance. During the process of being affected by the interference zone, the maximum drift angle of the yaw ship was less than 20 & DEG;, the course of the ship was generally stable, and the drift angle comparison error was a maximum of 10.6%, a minimum of 3.5%, and an average error of 6.7%. A negative peak and a positive peak of four times the absolute value of the negative peak occurred in the yaw-moment ephemeral curve during the ship's passage through the interference area. The method had a notable effect on the anti-striking of stalled ships and two invention patents applied for in the course of research.",2023,Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science; Physics,0
A Design Approach to Optimise Secure Remote Three-Dimensional (3D) Printing: A Proof-of-Concept Study towards Advancement in Telemedicine,3D printing; additive manufacturing; telemedicine; patient-centric dosage form; ACCEPTABILITY; AGE,"Telemedicine is defined as the delivery of healthcare services at a distance using electronic means. The incorporation of 3D printing in the telemedicine cycle could result in pharmacists designing and manufacturing personalised medicines based on the electronic prescription received. Even with the advantages of telemedicine, numerous barriers to the uptake hinder the wider uptake. Of particular concern is the cyber risk associated with the remote digital transfer of the computeraided design (CAD) file (acting as the electronic prescription) to the 3D printer and the reproducibility of the resultant printed medicinal products. This proof-of-concept study aimed to explore the application of secure remote 3D printing of model solid dosage forms using the patented technology, DEFEND3D, which is designed to enhance cybersecurity and intellectual property (IP) protection. The size, shape, and colour of the remote 3D-printed model medicinal products were also evaluated to ensure the end-product quality was user-focused. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and poly(lactic) acid (PLA) were chosen as model polymers due to their flexibility in preventing breakage printing and ease of printing with fused deposition modelling (FDM). Our work confirmed the potential of secure remote 3D (FDM) printing of prototype solid dosage forms resulting in products with good reproducibility, resolution, and quality towards advancements in telemedicine and digital pharmacies. The limitation of the work presented here was the use of model polymers and not pharmaceutically relevant polymers. Further work could be conducted using the same designs chosen in this study with pharmaceutically relevant polymers used in hot-melt extrusion (HME) with shown suitability for FDM 3D printing. However, it should be noted that any challenges that may occur with pharmaceutically relevant polymers are likely to be related to the polymer's printability and printer choice as opposed to the ability of the CAD file to be transferred to the printer remotely.",2022,Health Care Sciences & Services,0
GC-MS Profile of Hua-Feng-Dan and RNA-Seq Analysis of Induced Adaptive Responses in the Liver,Hua-Feng-Dan; RNA-seq; GC-MS; bioinformatics; adaptation; GEO database; GENE-EXPRESSION; REALGAR; MICE; PROTECTION; RESISTANCE; CINNABAR; BORNEOL,"Background: Hua-Feng-Dan is a patent Chinese medicine for stroke recovery and various diseases. This study used GC-MS to profile its ingredients and RNA-Seq to analyze the induced adaptive response in the liver.Methods: Hua-Feng-Dan was subjected to steam distillation and solvent extraction, followed by GC-MS analysis. Mice were orally administered Hua-Feng-Dan and its Guide drug Yaomu for 7 days. Liver pathology was examined, and total RNA isolated for RNA-Seq, followed by bioinformatic analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).Results: Forty-four volatile and fifty liposoluble components in Hua-Feng-Dan were profiled and analyzed by the NIST library and their concentrations quantified. The major components (>1%) in volatile (5) and liposoluble (10) were highlighted. Hua-Feng-Dan and Yaomu at hepatoprotective doses did not produce liver toxicity as evidenced by histopathology and serum enzyme activities. GO Enrichment revealed that Hua-Feng-Dan affected lipid homeostasis, protein folding, and cell adhesion. KEGG showed activated cholesterol metabolism, bile secretion, and PPAR signaling pathways. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by DESeq2 with p < 0.05 compared to controls. Hua-Feng-Dan produced more DEGs than Yaomu. qPCR on selected genes largely verified RNA-Seq results. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis of the upstream regulator revealed activation of MAPK and adaptive responses by Hua-Feng-Dan, and Yaomu was less effective. Hua-Feng-Dan-induced DEGs were highly correlated with the Gene Expression Omnibus database of chemical-induced adaptive transcriptome changes in the liver.Conclusion: GC-MS primarily profiled volatile and liposoluble components in Hua-Feng-Dan. Hua-Feng-Dan at the hepatoprotective dose did not produce liver pathological changes but induced metabolic and signaling pathway activations. The effects of Hua-Feng-Dan on liver transcriptome changes point toward induced adaptive responses to program the liver to produce hepatoprotective effects.",2022,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

Bioactive compounds of Artemisia annua have shown pharmacological activities and are used globally as a supplement. The present study tested whether dietary supplementation with alcohol extract of the plant A. annua (ae-Aa; patent BR10201902707) improves the health status of juvenile Nile tilapia and increases resistance to diseases when fish are challenged with the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. The experimental design was completely randomized with four experimental groups (0.0, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5% ae-Aa in the diets) with five repetitions (12 fish per repetition/experimental unit). We assessed serum glucose and cortisol levels in plasma, leukocyte respiratory activity, total plasma protein, serum lysozyme levels, as well as the number of circulating red blood cells and fish leukocytes at the end of the 30 days of feeding (phase I) and 24h after exposure to bacteria (phase II). The levels of lipid peroxidation, catalase activity and glutathione S-transferase of fish were also analyzed. The supplementation of 0.5% of ae-Aa was sufficient to increase the respiratory burst of leukocyte and lysozyme activity, total plasma protein, blood thrombocytes, neutrophils and monocytes after bacterial challenge (P < 0.05), and minimized stress response with decreases in plasmatic glucose and cortisol, and reduction in lipid peroxidation levels (P < 0.05). Results of the present study suggest that ae-Aa as a dietary supplement has benefits, including supplementation with 0.5% A. annua extract for 30 days to minimize the stress response and modulate innate immunity in Nile tilapia, providing fish with greater resistance and disease protection.",2020,Fisheries; Immunology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Veterinary Sciences,0

However, the environmental impact of intellectual property institution, especially its impact on carbon emissions, has been paid little attention. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to assess the effect of intellectual property institution on carbon emission reduction, revealing a new solution to control carbon emissions. To achieve the goal, this study regards the National Intellectual Property Demonstration City (NIPDC) policy in China as a quasi-natural experiment of intellectual property institution construction and exploits the difference in difference approach to objectively evaluate the impact of intellectual property institution on carbon emission reduction based on the panel data of China's cities. The study draws the following important conclusions. First, compared with non-pilot cities, the NIPDC policy has reduced urban carbon emissions by 8.64% in pilot cities. In particular, the carbon emission reduction dividend of the NIPDC policy is in the long term but not in the short term. Second, the influence mechanism analysis shows that the NIPDC policy can promote carbon emission reduction by stimulating technology innovation, especially breakthrough innovation. Third, the space overflow analysis reveals that the NIPDC policy can mitigate carbon emissions in adjacent areas, resulting in obvious spatial radiation effect. Fourth, the heterogeneity analysis confirms that the carbon emission reduction effect of the NIPDC policy is more obvious in low administrative hierarchic cities, small and medium-sized cities, and western cities. As a result, Chinese policymakers should orderly promote the construction of NIPDCs, strengthen technology innovation, give full play to the spatial radiation role of NIPDCs, and optimize the role of government, so as to better release the carbon emission abatement effect of intellectual property institution.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

However, the impact of green innovation (i.e., innovation relating to the environmentally sound technologies (ESTs)) on carbon emission performance in a large developing country, such as China, has been paid little attention. This paper investigates the impact of green innovation on carbon emission performance based on a panel data set covering 218 prefecture-level cities in China from 2007 to 2013. First, we examine whether heterogeneous green innovations have a synergistic effect on carbon emission performance using the two-way fixed effect model, instrumental variable method, and spatial econometric model. Moreover, using a causal mediation effect model, we identify four kinds of potential transmission channels of green innovation affecting carbon emission performance: energy consumption structure effect, industrial structure effect, urbanization effect, and foreign direct investment (FDI) effect. The results indicate a positive effect of green innovation and its sub-categories on carbon emission performance in China. However, a noteworthy phenomenon is that direct carbon emission-reduction innovation and green administrative innovation have a weaker effect on carbon emission performance than other kinds of green innovations. In addition, the positive effect has an evident heterogeneity in different kinds of cities. To be specific, green innovation has an evident positive impact on carbon emission performance in key cities for environmental protection, resource-based cities, non-resource-based cities, and central cities. Meanwhile, a snowball effect and a symbiotic effect of carbon emission performance exist in local cities and between cities, respectively. Finally, we find that green innovation significantly decreases and increases carbon emission performance through industrial structure effect and FDI effect, respectively. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Success DNA of a Record-Breaking Megaproject,Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge project; Project control; Incentivization; INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; INCENTIVE MECHANISMS; AGENCY-THEORY; PERFORMANCE; CONTRACTS; STRATEGIES; DYNAMICS; QUALITY; MODEL,"After 8 years of construction, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) came into use in October 2018. The HZMB is currently the world's longest oversea bridge. The HZMB is technically demanding for both the physical conditions and the stringent environmental protection measures. In addition, the involvement of three regional governments gave rise to complex coordination and communication issues. All these challenges called for supereffective project management. Notwithstanding, notable accomplishments were reported and more than 450 patents were obtained. For example, the rapid island formation technology used greatly shortened the construction period and saved cost. The project can be identified as a showcase of the latest oversea bridge construction technology. To unveil the success DNA of this record-breaking megaproject, an in-depth case study was conducted. While many reported case studies on the HZMB project have focused on the technical aspects, this case study takes a project management perspective. Through structured interviews, the HZMB project team members commented that the project reputation evaluation system (PRES) used in the project incentivized the contractors' performance through building an interorganizational relationship (IOR). This observation is in line with the proposition advocated in the IOR literature-an enhanced relationship has a positive effect on project performance. The comment of the project team member is further supported by the analyses of 28 sets of quarterly PRES evaluation scores that are reflective of IOR determinants. This study concludes that: (1) the PRES is an instrumental project management tool, and (2) one of the functions of the PRES is building IOR. The theoretical framework and empirical evidence showcase exemplary project management. Accordingly, it is further recommended that for megaprojects: (1) monetary reward cannot be the singular performance motivator, (2) IOR maintenance should be one of the planning foci of incentivization, and (3) there is no substitute for seamless communication in project management.",2020,Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,0
Carbon tax-driven technological innovation may accelerate the directional recovery of waste cooking oil into bio-jet fuel: An evolutionary game approach,Waste cooking oil; Bio-jet fuel; Directional flow; Evolution game; Innovation support; SUPPLY CHAIN; DESIGN; ENERGY,"Biofuel production from waste cooking oil (WCO) offers an alternative to fossil fuels, especially for high-value bio-jet fuel. However, this industry is hindered by informal recyclers who covertly divert large amounts of WCO to illegal gutter oil production. Investigating the dynamic evolution of stakeholder behavior will help explore solutions. Thus, this study presents a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes the government, formal recyclers, and informal recyclers, aims to redesign the government intervention strategy to promote the directional flow of WCO from restaurant trash cans to bio-jet fuel production. We find that the evolutionary game model exists eight possible evolutionary stability strategies (ESSs), and the choice of each ESS depends mainly on the trade-off between costs and revenues for each stakeholder. The numerical study results reveal that formal recyclers are driven to carry out technological innovation by government support, profiting from bio-aviation kerosene products, and income from carbon emission reduction. These factors also have an indirect impact on the transformation of informal recyclers. Therefore, the government should provide adequate support for technological innovation to formal recyclers and increase their profitability of products to enable them to actively implement innovative strategies. This can be achieved by expanding the sales channels of bio-jet fuel products, implementing patent protection measures, and improving the carbon reduction trading mechanism. Furthermore, the government ' s high tax rate on formal recyclers and the significant profits earned by informal recyclers through illegal gutter oil production may dissuade them from transitioning their businesses. Above findings are in line with the actual issues of WCO recycling and provide a new dynamic decision -making method for enterprises and government managers.",2024,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Unbalanced Arginine pathway and altered maturation of pleural macrophages in Th2-deficient mice during Litomosoides sigmodontis filarial infection,parasite; nematode; filariasis; microfilaria; macrophage; lung; pleura; VACCINE-INDUCED PROTECTION; MAJOR BASIC-PROTEIN; NITRIC-OXIDE; ONCHOCERCA-VOLVULUS; MURINE FILARIASIS; BRUGIA-MALAYI; INNATE RESISTANCE; INTERFERON-GAMMA; TYPE-2 IMMUNITY; TISSUE-REPAIR,"Filarial parasites are tissue dwelling worms transmitted by hematophagous vectors. Understanding the mechanisms regulating microfilariae (the parasite offspring) development is a prerequisite for controlling transmission in filarial infections. Th2 immune responses are key for building efficient anti-parasite responses but have been shown to also lead to detrimental tissue damage in the presence of microfilariae. Litomosoides sigmodontis, a rodent filaria residing in the pleural cavity was therefore used to characterize pleuropulmonary pathology and associated immune responses in wild-type and Th2 deficient mice. Wild-type and Th2-deficient mice (Il-4r alpha(-/-)/Il-5(-/-)) were infected with L. sigmodontis and parasite outcome was analyzed during the patent phase (when microfilariae are in the general circulation). Pleuropulmonary manifestations were investigated and pleural and bronchoalveolar cells were characterized by RNA analysis, imaging and/or flow cytometry focusing on macrophages. Il-4r alpha(-/-)/Il-5(-/-) mice were hypermicrofilaremic and showed an enhanced filarial survival but also displayed a drastic reduction of microfilaria-driven pleural cavity pathologies. In parallel, pleural macrophages from Il-4r alpha(-/-)/Il-5(-/-) mice lacked expression of prototypical alternative activation markers RELM alpha and Chil3 and showed an altered balance of some markers of the arginine metabolic pathway. In addition, monocytes-derived F4/80(intermediate) macrophages from infected Il-4r alpha(-/-)/Il-5(-/-) mice failed to mature into resident F4/80(high) large macrophages. Altogether these data emphasize that the presence of both microfilariae and IL-4R/IL-5 signaling are critical in the development of the pathology and in the phenotype of macrophages. In Il-4r alpha(-/-)/Il-5(-/-) mice, the balance is in favor of parasite development while limiting the pathology associated with the host immune response.",2022,Immunology,0
TnP Peptide Suppresses Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a Preclinical Mouse Model,EAE; synthetic peptide; fish venom; TnP; pre-clinical; disease-modifying therapies; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; FINGOLIMOD,"TnP is a family of patented synthetic peptides which is in a preclinical development stage with valuable potential therapeutic indication for multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The use of a preclinical animal model, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has deepened our knowledge of the immunomodulatory functions of TnP as a drug. We have shown that TnP possesses a disease suppressive function in EAE, ameliorating disease severity by 40% and suppressing the accumulation of T helper (Th)1- and Th17-producing lymphocytes (by 55% and 60%, respectively) in CNS along with activated microglia/macrophages populations (by 33% and 50%, respectively), and also conferred a protective effect anticipating the remyelination process to day 66 compared to day 83 of untreated cuprizone-mice. Here we expanded our knowledge about its effects compared with current first-line disease-modifying therapies (DMT). We demonstrated that prophylactic treatment with TnP generated similar protection to betaseron (30%) or was more effective than glatiramer (44% versus 6%) or fingolimod (50% versus 19%) against the development of clinical symptoms. Although TnP controlled the leukocyte infiltration (87% versus 82%) into demyelinated areas of the spinal cord in the same way as betaseron and fingolimod, it was more effective (72% to 78% decrease) in the long-term control of neuronal degeneration compared to them. Also, when compared to glatiramer, TnP was more efficient in reversing leukocytes infiltration into the spinal cord (55% versus 24%), as well as induced a higher percentage of regulatory cells in spleen (2.9-fold versus 2.3-fold increase over vehicle-treated EAE mice) an in the spinal cord (8-fold versus 6-fold increase over vehicle-treated EAE mice). This specialized TnP profile for inducing immune tolerance and neuronal regeneration has significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of MS and other autoimmune diseases.",2022,Immunology,0

As slope instability can lead to serious geological disasters, the ecological protection and reconstruction of slopes has become a hot topic of common global concern.MethodsIn order to achieve scientific slope management and overcome the difficulty of maintaining slope greening in the long term, this study explored eight strategies (A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, ABC, CK), involving different patented mineral solubilizing microorganisms (MSMs), and analyzed the field application of active permanent greening (APG) based on MSMs.ResultsThe results revealed that MSMs significantly increased the content of effective metal ions and available nutrients in soil and enhanced soil enzyme activity. Among all strategies, strategy A showed significant superiority, with soil effective calcium, magnesium, potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter contents increasing by 51.62%, 55.41%, 30.42%, 39.77%, 181.69% and 76.92%, respectively, while urease, sucrase and peroxidase activities increased by 89.59%, 74.68% and 85.30%.

However, whether larval migration is critical for inducing efficient type 2 responses remains poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated systemic versus local adaptive immune responses along the hepato-tracheal migration of Ascaris suum during primary, single infections in conventionally raised pigs. Neither the initial invasion of gut tissue nor migration through the liver resulted in discernable Th2 cell responses. In contrast, lung-stage larvae elicited a Th2-biased pulmonary response, which declined after the larvae had left the lungs. In the small intestine, we observed an accumulation of Th2 cells upon the arrival of fourth-stage larvae (L4) to the small intestinal lumen. In parallel, we noticed robust and increasing Th1 responses in circulation, migration-affected organs, and draining lymph nodes. Phenotypic analysis of CD4+ T cells specifically recognizing A. suum antigens in the circulation and lung tissue of infected pigs confirmed that the majority of Ascaris-specific T cells produced IL-4 (Th2) and, to a much lesser extent, IL-4/IFN-g (Th2/1 hybrids) or IFN-g alone (Th1). These data demonstrate that lung-stage but not the early liver-stage larvae lead to a locally restricted Th2 response. Significant Th2 cell accumulation in the small intestine occurs only when L4 complete the body migration. In addition, Th2 immunity seems to be hampered by the concurrent, nonspecific Th1 bias in growing pigs. Together, the late onset of Th2 immunity at the site of infection and the Th1-biased systemic immunity likely enable the establishment of intestinal infections by sufficiently large L4 stages and pre-adult worms, some of which resist expulsion mechanisms.",2024,Immunology,0

Despite the end of patent protection, SLAR remains resistant to generic competition likely due to complexity of production process, the uniqueness of the glucose star polymer, and the instability of octreotide in the formulation. Here, we describe development of glucose-PLGA-based composition-equivalent to SLAR formulations prepared by double emulsion-solvent evaporation method and the effect of variations in encapsulation variables on release kinetics and other formulation characteristics. The following encapsulation variables were adjusted at constant theoretical loading of 7.0% peptide: PLGA concentration, pH of inner water phase, and stirring rate. After final drying, the microspheres were examined with and without annealing at 50 degrees C under vacuum for 3 days. The loading and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of octreotide acetate, manufacturing yield, and in vitro drug release kinetics in PBStc (10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1% triethyl citrate and 0.02% sodium azide at pH 7.4) were determined by UPLC. The in vitro release and acylation kinetics of octreotide for the solvent evaporation formulations prepared were similar to SLAR although the initial burst was slightly higher. Key formulation steps identified to maximize microsphere yield and minimize residual solvent and initial burst release included (a) addition of acetic acid to the peptide before preparation and (b) annealing the microspheres under vacuum after drying. Controlled release octreotide formulations prepared and investigated in this study could provide a better understanding of the effect of production variables on release performance and supply information useful for making progress in manufacturing of SLAR generic equivalents.",2022,Instruments & Instrumentation; Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
The Analysis of a Prototype Installation for Biogas Production from Chosen Agricultural Substrates,biomass; manure; pocket; biogas yield; methane fermentation; methane production by fermentation; ANAEROBIC CO-DIGESTION; METHANE; MANURE; PRETREATMENT; WASTES; FUTURE,"Methane production by fermentation is a complex biochemical process, in which micromolecular organic substances are broken down by anaerobic bacteria into simple stabilized chemicals-mainly methane CH4 and carbon dioxide CO2. The organic matter of the slurry consists mainly of fats, proteins and carbohydrates. As a result of biochemical changes in the process of anaerobic decomposition, some of this matter is mineralized to simple chemical compounds. Cattle and pig husbandry offers enormous potential for useable biogas plant substrates. As a result of the constantly increasing amounts of animal husbandry products, and increasingly stringent environmental protection requirements aimed at reusing natural fertilizers, it is necessary to look for alternative processing methods. The need for efficiency in obtaining biogas from substrates (e.g., manure) was met by the laboratory stand presented in this article, for which the Polish patent No. 232200 was obtained. The new technology also allows leaching of the organic liquid, e.g., from manure, and subjecting it to methane fermentation. The solution allows the individual elements of the technological line that determine the fermentation process to be tested under laboratory conditions. It also allows testing of the substrates in terms of fermentation, to determine their physical and chemical characteristics, and then to characterize the fermentation process in terms of the quality and quantity of the resulting biogas and the quality of post-fermentation residues. Compressing biogas for local distribution was also proposed. As part of the research, using a laboratory stand, the organic matter was leached from manure, for the purpose of biogas production. In addition, the biogas yield from manure at varying degrees of maturity was assessed. The best properties in terms of biogas yield forecasting were demonstrated by manure composted for 4-8 weeks.",2021,Energy & Fuels,0

Tongtian Oral Liquid (TTKFY) is one such patented TCM, and a poly-herbal formulation, composed of 11 herbal con-stituents, which possess neuroprotective, antioxidant, pain-relieving properties. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridin (MPTP), a neurotoxicant is used to induce PD in animal models. The present study was aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of TTKFY, on dopaminergic neuron development, antioxidant activities, and gene expression involved in the dopaminergic pathway in the MPTP-treated zebrafish model. Zebrafish larvae were treated with MPTP (70 mu M) to induce PD and then by different concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 4 ml/L) of TTKFY. Transgenic zebrafish Vmat: GFP at 5 dpf were used to observe the development of dopaminergic neurons. The activities of T-Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), malonaldehyde (MDA) and mRNA gene expression of dopamine pathway were quantified. MPTP-treated zebrafish larvae showed degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, locomotion dysfunction, diminished activities of antioxidant enzymes, MDA accumulation, and altered gene expression of dopamine pathway. In contrast, TTKFY protected dopami-nergic neurons, ameliorated behavioral impairments, antioxidant activities and mRNA gene expression of dopamine pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, TTKFY confers protective effects against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity and the mechanisms of protection may be related to the recovery of dopaminergic neurons by reducing oxidative stress via restoring cellular defense mechanisms and thereby highlighting its therapeutic potential to prevent the progression of PD. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of action of TTKFY on neuroprotection in the MPTP-induced PD model.",2022,Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

Can performance-based budgeting reform improve corporate environment in ESG? Evidence from Chinese-listed firms,ESG; environment in ESG; fiscal and tax system; performance-based budgeting; DID; China; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MATTER,"Finance is a pillar industry of national governance. It also provides a solid guarantee for achieving the official Double Carbon target. The question of how to forefront the role of environmental governance in the reform of fiscal and taxation systems, whilst also motivating enterprises to enhance Environment in Environmental, Social, and Governance (EESG) considerations is worth investigating in depth. This study takes A-share listed companies in China from 2001 to 2020 as examples. The effect of Performance-Based Budgeting (PBB) reform on the EESG of these enterprises is empirically examined through quasi-natural experiments using a multi-time difference-in-difference model. We find that PBB significantly optimizes the EESG of the enterprises. The placebo test, the difference-in-difference method, and a series of other robustness tests all support this conclusion. Furthermore, it is suggested that the environmental governance effect of PBB is more significant in areas with heavy financial pressure and stronger government audit. The environmental governance effect of the PBB reform is significant for enterprises with government contracts, strong green innovation capabilities, or high financing constraints. The mechanism test is performed, and the results suggest that the influence mechanism of this environmental governance role lies in the fact that PBB has improved environmental protection subsidies and enhanced fiscal transparency. Through the economic consequences test, we find that enterprise EESG can bring economic benefits to enterprises, which is reflected in the improvement of enterprise return on total assets, price-to-book ratio, and total patent authorization. This study enriches literature on the economic consequences of PBB, and has significance in deepening current fiscal and tax system reform, vigorously optimizing the major strategy of carbon peak and carbon neutrality.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Nevertheless, for these plants to operate effec-tively, high-quality installations, regular maintenance, and detailed inspections are required. The purpose of this paper is to review different monitoring techniques of large photovoltaic (PV) plants. They can be categorized into cameras or non-cameras-based techniques which both yield complementary information. Indeed, the paper shows that up-today, there is no sensing technique which is adequate to operate in all conditions or to satisfy all possible constraints. For instance, while cameras allow quick contactless and non-destructive monitoring, other techniques yield more accurate information on the types of faults. Advances in unmanned aerial vehicles and edge processors gave wider monitoring opportunities by significantly exhibiting the process while accurately providing the location of the faults. The topic addressed in this paper is critical for years to come since several kinds of faults may occur frequently causing substantial power losses and, in some cases, raising serious safety threats. This has motivated some researchers to issue related review papers. Nevertheless, this paper addresses the state-of-the-art technique for every type of fault in addition to explain the concepts of most recent sensors. This is required to grasp the methodologies implemented to satisfy the underlined accuracy and safety con-straints. For instance, the paper lists five different kind of voltage/current sensors having different accuracy levels and suggest their adequate placement within the PV plants. In addition to different intellectual property works which were disclosed in patents, the paper also exhibits several commercially available inspection in-struments, in addition to most recent industrial achievements and real-field experience.

"Environmental regulation, green innovation, and international competitiveness of manufacturing enterprises in China: From the perspective of heterogeneous regulatory tools",; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SOPHISTICATION; EXPORTS; MEDIATION; SECTOR; IMPACT,"Based on combined data from the China Patent Database, China Industrial Enterprise Database, and China Customs Import and Export Database for the period 2004-2010, this study investigates the impact of heterogeneous environmental regulations on the export technological sophistication of manufacturing enterprises. Given deepening international market segmentation of production and the increasing proportion of intermediate trade, and compared with the traditional method based on exports, the export technological sophistication calculated here, based on value-added, is closer to the true level. Since there has been no in-depth comparative study on the relationship between heterogeneous environmental regulation and export technological sophistication, this study fills the gap. The results show that all three regulation types bear a U-shaped impact on export technological sophistication. Command-control regulation exhibits a restraining effect on mixed trade, eastern, and foreign-funded enterprises. Market-incentive regulation promotes processing and mixed trade enterprises as well as domestic and foreign-funded enterprises. Voluntary-participation regulation promotes all enterprises with different trade patterns and ownership. The mechanism analysis shows that command-control and market-participation environmental regulations affect export technological sophistication through the green invention and green utility innovation channels, while, additionally, market-incentive environmental regulation affects export technological sophistication through the green design innovation channel. Considering the environmental governance issues, the policy implications for enhancing the entire industrial chain and enterprises' export competitiveness are clear. Due to the unclear functions and powers of competent departments and a rigid threshold, command-control regulation is not conducive to cleaner production technology and the promotion of enterprises' export competitiveness; it should thus be discouraged. Although both market-incentive and voluntary-participation regulations have promoted cleaner production technology and enterprises' competitiveness significantly, the environmental tax system requires continuous improvement. The government should continue to raise public involvement in environmental protection to enrich the channels and forms of environmental management.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0

We aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of GXNT against atherosclerosis (AS) through network pharmacology and molecular docking verification.Methods:The active ingredients and their potential targets of GXNT were obtained in traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform and bioinformatics analysis tool for molecular mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine databases. DrugBank, TTD, DisGeNET, OMIM, and GeneCards databases were used to screen the targets of AS. The intersection targets gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analysis were performed in DAVID database. GXNT-AS protein-protein interaction network, ingredient-target network and herb-target-pathway network were constructed by Cytoscape. Finally, we used AutoDock for molecular docking.Results:We screened 65 active ingredients of GXNT and 70 GXNT-AS intersection targets. The key targets of protein-protein interaction network were AKT1, JUN, STAT3, TNF, TP53, IL6, EGFR, MAPK14, RELA, and CASP3. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed that pathways in cancer, lipid and atherosclerosis, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were the main pathways.

More significantly, HXZQOL is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, and it has been clinically proven to reduce the inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19. However, the effective and overall quality control of HXZQOL is currently limited due to its complex composition, especially the large amount of volatile and non-volatile active components involved. In this study, aimed to fully develop a comprehensive strategy based on non-targeted multicomponent identification, targeted authentication and quantitative analysis for quality evaluation of HXZQOL from different batches. Firstly, the non-targeted high-definition MSE (HDMSE) approach is established based on UHPLC/IMQTOF-MS, utilized for multicomponent comprehensive characterization of HXZQOL. Combined with in house library-driven automated peak annotation and comparison of 47 reference compounds, 195 components were initially identified. In addition, HS-SPME-GC-MS was employed to analyze the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in HXZQOL, and a total of 61 components were identified by comparison to the NIST database, reference compounds as well as retention indices. Secondly, based on the selective ion monitoring (SIM) of 24 identity markers (involving each herbal medicine), characteristic chromatograms (CCs) were established on LC-MS and GC-MS respectively, to authenticate 15 batches of HXZQOL samples. The targeted-SIM CCs showed that all marker compounds in 15 batches of samples could be accurately monitored, which could indicate preparations authenticity. Finally, a parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) method was established and validated to quantify the nine compounds in 15 batches of HXZQOL. Conclusively, this study first reports chemical-material basis, SIM CCs and quality evaluation of HXZQOL, which is of great implication to quality control and ensuring the authenticity of the preparation.",2023,Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

Materials and methods: Rats were treated with either vehicle or YMJD for 14 consecutive days, and 2 h after the last administration, the rat model of ALI was induced by the intratracheal instillation of LPS. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was applied for the fingerprint analysis of YMJD. The efficacy and molecular mechanisms were investigated.Results: The results showed that treatment with YMJD improved the general state of rats, reduced weight loss and serum lactate (LA) levels, attenuated pulmonary edema and pathological damage of the lung tissue. Moreover, we found that YMJD effectively decreased the infiltration of white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes (LYM), mononuclear cells (MON) and neutrophils (NEUT) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), reduced the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-& alpha; (TNF-& alpha;) and interleukin-113 (IL-113) and inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the lung tissue. Additionally, we found that YMJD could significantly increase the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduce the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the lung tissue. By employing RNA-sequencing, we have identified that JAK2/STAT1 is an important pathway that is involved in the lung protection of YMJD, and further Western blot assay verified that YMJD could effectively inhibit the activation of the JAK2/STAT1 pathway.Conclusions: YMJD could attenuate LPS-induced ALI through suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress in the lung tissue of rats, associating with the inhibition of JAK2/STAT1 activation. These findings provide evidence for the clinical use of YMJD for treatment of inflammatory pulmonary diseases like ALI.",2023,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,0
Gastroprotective effect of gallic acid against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats: Involvement of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and anti-apoptosis role,Gallic acid; Antioxidants; Gastric ulcer; Nrf2/HO-1; SHUANGDAN ORAL LIQUID; QUANTITATIVE-DETERMINATION; ACTIVE COMPONENTS; INFLAMMATION; ANTIOXIDANT; PROSTAGLANDINS; MECHANISMS; PROTECTION; DANSHENSU; DISEASES,"Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, GA) is a phenolic compound found in many medicinal plants traditionally used in China or patent medicine such as Feiyangchangweiyan capsule (FY capsule) for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases for decades. However, the evidence for the gastroprotective effect of GA is deficient and the pharmacological mechanisms remain limited. The present investigation was initiated to demonstrate the gastroprotective effect and to understand potential underlying mechanism of GA on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats. Gastric ulcers were induced by absolute ethanol (5 mL/kg, i.g.) in male Sprague-Dawley rats, GA (10, 30, and 50 mg/kg), FY capsule (0.4 g/kg) and 30 mg/kg Lansoprazole was administered orally. Physiological saline and lansoprazole were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Induction of rats with ethanol resulted in a significant rise in ulcer index, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines markers (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha), TBARS, protein expression of Bax and Caspase-3 and a significant reduction in the activities or levels of endogenous antioxidants (SOD, CAT and GSH), gastric mucosal protective factors (PGE2 and NO) and protein expression of Bcl-2. Pretreatment with GA showed a remarkable decrease in ulcer index, inflammatory cytokines markers, TBARS, protein expression of Bax and Caspase-3 and a significant increase in the activities of endogenous antioxidants, levels of PGE2 and NO, and protein expression of Bcl-2, Nrf2 and HO-1 when compared with ethanol treated groups. This study demonstrated the gastroprotective effect of Gallic acid and FY capsule on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats. The underlying mechanism of GA and FY capsule against gastric ulcer in rats caused by ethanol might be involved in Nrf2/HO-1 anti-oxidative pathway and ultimately played an anti-apoptotic role through regulating Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3.",2020,Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
Exploring new uses for existing drugs: innovative mechanisms to fund independent clinical research,Drug repurposing; Clinical research; Research funding; Public-private partnerships; Crowdfunding; Social impact bonds; PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; REPURPOSING DRUGS; RARE DISEASES; GENERIC DRUGS; TRIALS; CANCER; ONCOLOGY; CHALLENGES; OPPORTUNITIES; STRATEGIES,"Background Finding new therapeutic uses for existing medicines could lead to safe, affordable and timely new treatment options for patients with high medical needs. However, due to a lack of economic incentives, pharmaceutical developers are rarely interested to invest in research with approved medicines, especially when they are out of basic patent or regulatory protection. Consequently, potential new uses for these medicines are mainly studied in independent clinical trials initiated and led by researchers from academia, research institutes, or collaborative groups. Yet, additional financial support is needed to conduct expensive phase III clinical trials to confirm the results from exploratory research. Methods In this study, scientific and grey literature was searched to identify and evaluate new mechanisms for funding clinical trials with repurposed medicines. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 European stakeholders with expertise in clinical research, funding mechanisms and/or drug repurposing between November 2018 and February 2019 to consider the future perspectives of applying new funding mechanisms. Results Traditional grant funding awarded by government and philanthropic organisations or companies is well known and widely implemented in all research fields. In contrast, only little research has focused on the application potential of newer mechanisms to fund independent clinical research, such as social impact bonds, crowdfunding or public-private partnerships. Interviewees stated that there is a substantial need for additional financial support in health research, especially in areas where there is limited commercial interest. However, the implementation of new funding mechanisms is facing several practical and financial challenges, such as a lack of expertise and guidelines, high transaction costs and difficulties to measure health outcomes. Furthermore, interviewees highlighted the need for increased collaboration and centralisation at a European and international level to make clinical research more efficient and reduce the need for additional funding. Conclusions New funding mechanisms to support clinical research may become more important in the future but the unresolved issues identified in the current study warrant further exploration.",2021,Research & Experimental Medicine,0
Health professionals' knowledge and attitude towards patient confidentiality and associated factors in a resource-limited setting: a cross-sectional study,Health professional; Knowledge; Attitude; Confidentiality; Ethiopia; PHYSICIANS; PROTECTION; NURSES,"Background Respecting patients' confidentiality is an ethical and legal responsibility for health professionals and the cornerstone of care excellence. This study aims to assess health professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and associated factors towards patients' confidentiality in a resource-limited setting. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 health professionals. Stratified sampling methods were used to select the participants, and a structured self-administer questionnaire was used for data collection. The data was entered using Epi-data version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS, version 25. Bi-variable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were used to measure the association between the dependent and independent variables. Odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals and P value was calculated to determine the strength of association and to evaluate statistical significance. Result Out of 410 participants, about 59.8% with [95% CI (54.8-68.8%)] and 49.5% with [95% CI (44.5-54.5%)] had good knowledge and favorable attitude towards patents confidentiality respectively. Being male (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI [1.03-2.59]), taking training on medical ethics (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI = [1.11-2.70]), facing ethical dilemmas (AOR = 3.07, 95% CI [1.07-8.79]) were significantly associated factors for health professional knowledge towards patients' confidentiality. Likewise, taking training on medical ethics (AOR = 2.30, 95% CI [1.42-3.72]), having direct contact with the patients (AOR = 3.06, 95% CI [1.12-8.34]), visiting more patient (AOR = 4.38, 95% CI [2.46-7.80]), and facing ethical dilemma (AOR = 3.56, 95% CI [1.23-10.26]) were significant factors associated with attitude of health professionals towards patient confidentiality. Conclusion The findings of this study revealed that health professionals have a limited attitude towards patient confidentiality but have relatively good knowledge. Providing a continuing medical ethics training package for health workers before joining the hospital and in between the working time could be recommended to enhance health professionals' knowledge and attitude towards patient confidentiality.",2022,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics; Biomedical Social Sciences,0

Socio-economic crime can be committed by anybody whether it's a man or woman , multi-national company or a big wealthy entrepreneur guilty for tax evasion and middle class pensioner depositing false return, only the former can be considered as White Collar Crime. It is an everyday fact of life that huge percentage of offence are committed all over the world, it's a sensation issue and challenge for prevention and protection. White collar crime is a crime committed by the people of reputable group and high social status during the course of their occupation through misrepresentation, fraudulent advertisements, infringement of patents, copy rights and trademarks etc with a view to earn huge profits these criminal practices are very common to trade, commerce, education, health etc. Law Commission of India had suggested many changes in the statutes dealing with socio-economic offences, so as to make the punishments more stringent for punishing the socio-economic offenders. Subsequently the 47th Law Commission Report identified new composite three basic forms of socio-economic offences as first of all an Illegal Economic Activities, Secondly a Illegal way of performing commercial and allied transaction, Thirdly, if an Evasion of public taxes or monetary liabilities. all white collar crimes can be socio-economic offences but not all socio-economic offences can be termed as white collar crimes. All type of crimes are rampant inside the society. Increase in crimes in general has led to believe the society that people have developed immunity against law and equally on criminal justice administration.

Age-Deterring and Skin Care Function of a Polyphenol Rich Sugarcane Concentrate,anti-aging; UV protection; MMP-1; melanin pigmentation; wrinkle reduction; tyrosinase; elastase; TELOMERASE ACTIVITY; TYROSINASE; INGREDIENTS; FIBROBLASTS; ANTIOXIDANT; EXTRACTS; L.,"Increasing evidence suggests that environmental stress, such as UV radiation, generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in skin cells, leading to histochemical changes including skin disorders and aging, hyper pigmentation, and increased formation of wrinkles. Besides the defensive system in skin composed of vitamins and intrinsic antioxidant enzymes, topical and skin conditioning products have been used commonly to eradicate or eliminate these skin ailments. Among various ingredients providing nourishing and moisturizing effect in skin, antioxidants have been reported to be a key ingredient to counteract skin aging processes and skin disorders. Derived from a patented extraction process, a polyphenol rich sugarcane concentrate (Officinol (TM)) becomes the focus of this study due to its rich content of polyphenols known to be strong antioxidants. In this work, we carried out a series of cell-based in vitro studies to examine the use of Officinol (TM) in anti-aging and skin care functions. Our studies show that Officinol (TM) activated telomerase, a major biomarker that have been reported to be associated with slowed cellular aging process. When skin cells were under environmental stress such as UV radiation, Officinol (TM) inhibited MMP-1, an interstitial collagenase in skin cells, and deterred the breakdown of collagen that provides supple texture in skin. Officinol (TM) also inhibited cellular expression of melanin pigmentation and tyrosinase activity, two major biomarkers causing skin pigmentation and aging spots, and inhibited elastase, an enzyme that facilities the reduction of skin elasticity. At the end of the investigation, we carried out a 10-person, pilot study to examine the effect of Officinol (TM) on skin lightening and fine line and wrinkle reduction in human skin. The combination of the in vitro and the human pre-study indicates that Officinol (TM) could provide significant preventative and protective functions including antioxidant, anti-aging, wrinkle reduction, and skin brightening for human skin suffering from aging and other stress. These findings are to be confirmed with a larger scale clinical study at a later stage.",2020,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Dermatology,0

Environmental science requires efforts in the detection and elimination of manifold pollutants and emerging pollutants with appropriate product and process technologies. This study aims to analyze different paths of treatment technologies to investigate their evolution and predict new directions of promising technological trajectories to support the removal of con-taminants directed to reach, whenever possible, sustainable development objectives. The work is mainly devoted to wastewater treatment technologies. A proposed model analyzes the evolution of patents (proxy of innovation and new technology) on publications (proxy of science and knowledge advances) to quantify the relative growth rate of new trajectories of technologies to remove pollutants and emerging contaminants. Results reveal that new directions of treatment technologies having an accelerated rate of growth are (in decreasing order): biochar and reverse osmosis in physical-based technologies, coagulation, and disinfection water treatments in chemical-based technologies and anaerobic processes in biological-based technologies. Other main technologies, such as carbon nanotubes and advanced oxidation processes, seem to be in the initial phase of development and need learning by using processes and further science and technology advances to be implemented as effective treatments and cost-effective methods. The results here show similar trends to global market revenue in water and wastewater treatment technologies. These findings bring us to the main information to extend the knowledge about new directions of technologies for the treatment and/or elimination of pollutants and microorganisms in order to support decisions of policymakers towards goals of sustainable development by reducing environmental degradation and people health disorders.",2023,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0
Performance assessment of an electrostatic filter-diverter stent cerebrovascular protection device. Is it possible not to use anticoagulants in atrial fibrilation elderly patients?,computational fluid dynamics modeling (CFD); atrial fibrillation; TAVR; silent brain Infarcts; stroke; particle flow simulation; cerebroembolic protection devices; aortic arch; AORTIC-VALVE IMPLANTATION; STROKE PREVENTION; FIBRILLATION; ASSOCIATION; REPLACEMENT; WARFARIN; SAFETY,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Nearly two-thirds of strokes are produced by cardioembolisms, and half of cardioembolic strokes are triggered by Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common type of arrhythmia. A more recent cause of cardioembolisms is Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacements (TAVRs), which may onset post-procedural adverse events such as stroke and Silent Brain Infarcts (SBIs), for which no definitive treatment exists, and which will only get worse as TAVRs are implanted in younger and lower risk patients. It is well known that some specific characteristics of elderly patients may lower the safety and efficacy of anticoagulation therapy, making it a real urgency to find alternative therapies. We propose a device consisting of a strut structure placed at the base of the treated artery to model the potential risk of cerebral embolisms caused by dislodged debris of varying sizes. This work analyzes a design based on a patented medical device, intended to block cardioembolisms from entering the cerebrovascular system, with a particular focus on AF, and potentially TAVR patients. The study has been carried out in two stages. Both of them based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking method. The first stage of the work evaluates a variety of strut thicknesses and inter-strut spacings, contrasting with the device-free baseline geometry. The analysis is carried out by imposing flowrate waveforms characteristic of both healthy and AF patients. Boundary conditions are calibrated to reproduce physiological flowrates and pressures in a patient's aortic arch. In the second stage, the optimal geometric design from the first stage was employed, with the addition of lateral struts to prevent the filtration of particles and electronegatively charged strut surfaces, studying the effect of electrical forces on the clots if they are considered charged. Flowrate boundary conditions were used to emulate both healthy and AF conditions. Results from numerical simulations coming form the first stage indicate that the device blocks particles of sizes larger than the inter-strut spacing. It was found that lateral strut space had the highest impact on efficacy. Based on the results of the second stage, deploying the electronegatively charged device in all three aortic arch arteries, the number of particles entering these arteries was reduced on average by 62.6% and 51.2%, for the healthy and diseased models respectively, matching or surpassing current oral anticoagulant efficacy. In conclusion, the device demonstrated a two-fold mechanism for filtering emboli: while the smallest particles are deflected by electrostatic repulsion, avoiding microembolisms, which could lead to cognitive impairment, the largest ones are mechanically filtered since they cannot fit in between the struts, effectively blocking the full range of particle sizes analyzed in this study. The device presented in this manuscript offers an anticoagulant-free method to prevent stroke and SBIs, imperative given the growing population of AF and elderly patients.",2023,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,0
"Comparison of Uptake and Prices of Biosimilars in the US, Germany, and Switzerland",; RATIONALE; EUROPE,"IMPORTANCE Biologics account for a substantial proportion of health care expenditures. Their costs have been projected to reach US $452 billion in global spending by 2022. Given recent expiration of patent protection of biologics, a shift toward greater follow-on competition among biosimilars would be expected that would allow greater uptake and lower drug costs. OBJECTIVE To assess uptake and prices of biosimilars in the US compared with 2 European countries (Germany and Switzerland) with national mechanisms for drug price negotiation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cohort study, biologics and biosimilars that were approved in the US, Germany, and Switzerland until August 2020 were identified. Prices and sales data were extracted from public and commercial databases for the years 2011 to 2020. Data were analyzed from August 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Descriptive statistics were used to show temporal trends in the uptake of biosimilars and relative prices compared with those of reference products (ie, biologic agents) for each country. Descriptive analysis was also performed to compare the uptake of biosimilars between the 3 countries limited to biologics that have biosimilars on the market in all countries. To test if biosimilar awareness in each country increased over the last decade, a linear least squares regression was applied. RESULTS The study cohort included 15 biosimilars and 6 biologics for the US, 52 biosimilars and 15 biologics for Germany, and 28 biosimilars and 13 biologics for Switzerland. Uptake of biosimilars increased over time in all countries. On average, the biosimilar market share at launch was highest in Germany; however, it increased at the fastest rate in the US. Monthly treatment costs of biosimilars in the US were a median of 1.94 (IQR, 1.78-2.44) and 2.74 (IQR, 1.91-3.46) higher than corresponding costs in Germany and Switzerland, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this cohort study suggest that more biosimilars have been marketed in Germany and Switzerland than in the US. Policies that counter anticompetitive practices in the US could allow biosimilars to enter the market sooner and could also lower health care costs with improved access. Awareness of biosimilars should be promoted to increase uptake of biosimilars globally.",2022,General & Internal Medicine,0
Green innovation risk index screening under the global value chain based on the group decision characteristic root method,global value chain; green innovation; risk identification; group decision characteristic root; index screening; ,"As there are a large number of risk factors affecting green innovation under the global value chain, the screening of risk indicators is a key link in developing green innovation activities. Through the analysis of the influencing factors of current green innovation risk, the primary index of green innovation risk is established. The group decision characteristic root method is used to identify the key importance of primary indicators of green innovation risk and construct the global value chain's green innovation risk index system, which provides a scientific method and new ideas for measuring and evaluating green innovation risk in the global value chain. The empirical results of this paper are as follows: 1) green R & D risk measurement indicators under the global value chain include the proportion of global green R & D personnel investment, the proportion of global green R & D capital investment, the stability of global green R & D in manufacturing, the ease of international transfer of green technology, and the international protection of green technology patents; 2) Green manufacturing risk measurement indicators under the global value chain have seven risk factors: the proportion of global green manufacturing personnel investment, the proportion of global green manufacturing capital investment, the global green manufacturing product production scale, the global green manufacturing product quality performance level, the global outsourcing scale of green products, the global green manufacturing technology transformation degree of manufacturing industry, and the global green manufacturing cost increase; 3) green marketing risk measurement indicators under the global value chain have seven risk factors: the proportion of global green marketing personnel investment, the proportion of global green marketing capital investment, the international demand level for green products, the international market competition intensity of green products, the possession of green products to existing international marketing channels, the commercialization and internationalization level of green technology, and the intensity of green technical barriers to trade in the international community; and 4) green service risk measurement indicators under the global value chain have five risk factors: the proportion of global green service personnel investment, the proportion of global green service capital investment, the (1)coverage of global green service outlets, the globalization level of global green product supply chain, and the global after-sales technical service capability of green products.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

The comparative analysis covered selected eco-innovation indicators and sub-indicators for nine catching-up economies compared to the leading countries and the EU average.Findings: The results show that despite the fact that almost all economies from the group of catching-up eco-innovators made progress in terms of their overall eco-innovation performance, albeit they were una-ble to significantly reduce the innovation gap between them, and the leading countries and their classifica-tion based on relative results remained unchanged in the recent decade. This suggests that more effort, focused especially on specific thematic areas, is needed for these countries to make bigger progress and to move up to the average eco-innovation performers and even to the leading eco-innovators. The strongest correlation between the value of the Eco-Innovation Index and the value of a given subindex suggests that the main areas for improvement are: total R&D personnel and researchers, eco-innovation-related patents, energy productivity and implementation of sustainable products among SMEs, but all of the areas covered by subsequent subindexes need attention. Implications & Recommendations: Taking into consideration the fact that eco-innovations are important tools for achieving sustainable development goals, the results of the study may provide important guidance for policy-makers in the area of innovation policy and sustainable development, especially in economies clas-sified as 'catching up with eco-innovation.' Contribution & Value Added: By focusing on the eco-innovation gap between the countries leading in this respect and those catching up, we have identified the key areas that require significant improvement, looking from the perspective of countries currently achieving relatively weak results in individual dimensions of eco-innovation and striving to improve their innovation performance.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Analysis of the history of creation and improvement of personal protective equipment: from bronze armor to modern bulletproof vests,body armor; bulletproof; Casimir Zeglen; Jan Szczepanik; Stephanie Louise Kwolek; kevlar; BODY ARMOR,"In this article, using real historical examples, the authors tried to trace the evolution of personal protective equipment. This has made it possible to perform a comparative historical analysis of the development of scientific research and industrial technologies, which made it possible to manufacture specific personal protective equipment in a certain historical period. Also in this review article, the authors have analyzed the stages of modern technologies that are currently used in the manufacture of various types of bulletproof vest. And given that the overwhelming majority of authors of publications devoted to the history of the creation of bulletproof vests write that: the bulletproof vest does not have a specific inventor, in this review article the authors also talk about specific, undeservedly forgotten now, the creators of the world's first officially patented prototypes of bulletproof vests for the police and VIP-persons, at the beginning of the 20th century, who stood at the origins of the bulletproof vest industry. With the development of the industrial revolution and technological progress, new materials and production technologies have appeared, allowing the creation of more effective bulletproof vest. Bulletproof vest has become lighter and more effective over time, thanks to the use of new materials such as Kevlar, aramid fibers and ceramics. Thus, the history of the development of bulletproof vest includes the contribution of many scientists, engineers and inventors who have contributed to the improvement of protective armor over the years. In the article, the authors show that modern realities put forward new requirements for quality, weight and functional characteristics for design engineers and manufacturers of bulletproof vest. The authors of the article analyze the main directions in which research work is currently underway to improve bulletproof vests. The authors of the article show that in different countries of the world there are different standards and classifications for bulletproof vest. Each standard usually has its own classification, which determines the level of protection of bulletproof vest against specific types of threats, such as bullets, shrapnel or stab wounds. Therefore, the task of developing a single standard for modern bulletproof vest is important.",2023,History & Philosophy of Science,0

A TBI-specific dose calculation model was built with data acquired at the treatment planning system (TPS)-permitted maximum 140-cm SSD and was validated in phantoms at a 180-cm SSD. As for planning strategies, we adopted large anterior-to-posterior/posterior-to-anterior (AP/PA) open fields with multi-leaf collimator shielding for lungs to achieve target coverage, lung protection, and efficient dose delivery. A custom-designed sliding couch (Patent No. ZL202123085880.1) was manufactured to support patients during treatment. Measures to control the quality and safety of TBI treatment include machine interlocks, pretreatment checklists, and in-vivo dose monitoring.ResultsThe instantaneous dose rate of block-filtered 6MV X-ray was reduced to approximately 7.0 cGy/min at 12.5-7.5 cm depth with a 185-200 cm SSD. The dose calculated by TPS differs from the measurements by 0.15%-1.55% in the homogeneous phantom and 1.2%-4.85% in the CIRS thorax phantom. The open-field TBI technique achieved V90% (PTV) approximate to 96.8% and MLD = 6.6 Gy with 1-h planning and 50-min beam delivery in a single fraction. From February 2021 to July 2023, 30 patients received TBI treatments in our center, and in-vivo monitoring results differed from TPS calculations by -1.49%-2.10%. After 6-12 months of follow-ups, all the patients treated in our center showed no pulmonary toxicities of grade 2 or higher.ConclusionA low instantaneous dose rate TBI technique can be implemented in the clinic.",2024,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",0
Clinical Correlates of Moderate-to-Severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Preterm Infants following Surgical Necrotizing Enterocolitis,necrotizing enterocolitis; preterm Infants; BPD; ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY; PHAGOCYTOSIS; OUTCOMES; GROWTH,"Objective The aim of the study is to determine clinical correlates of moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants following surgical necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Study Design This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study comparing patients with moderate to severe BPD to patients with non/mild BPD among surgical NEC infants. BPD was defined by NIH 2001 consensus definition. Results Of 92 consecutive neonates with surgical NEC, 77% (71/92) had moderate/severe BPD and 22% (21/92) had non/mild BPD. The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was significantly higher in those developing moderate/severe BPD (67.6% [48/71]) than non/mild BPD (28.6% [6/21]; p = 0.001). Postoperatively, infants with moderate/severe BPD had more severe acute kidney injury (AKI; 67.6 [48/71] vs. 28.6% [6/21]; p = 0.001), were intubated longer (40.5 [interquartile (IQR): 12, 59] vs. 6 days [IQR: 2, 13]; p <0.001), received more parenteral nutrition (109 [IQR: 77, 147] vs. 55 days [IQR: 19, 70]; p <0.001), developed higher surgical morbidity (46.5 [33/71] vs. 14.3% [3/21]; p = 0.008), had more intestinal failure (62.5 vs. 13.3%; p <0.001), required a longer hospital stay (161 [IQR: 112, 186] vs. 64 days [IQR: 20, 91]; p <0.001), and were more likely to need home oxygen. In a multivariable analysis, lower birth weight (OR = 0.3, [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1-0.5]; p = 0.001), PDA (OR = 10.3, [95% CI: 1.6-65.4]; p = 0.014), and longer parenteral nutritional days (OR = 8.8; [95% CI: 2.0-43.0]; p = 0.005) were significantly and independently associated with higher odds of moderate/severe versus non-/mild BPD. Conclusion Development of moderate/severe BPD occurred in the majority of preterm infants with surgical NEC in this consecutive series. Preterm infants with moderate/severe BPD were more likely to have a PDA before NEC. Development of moderate/severe BPD was associated with significantly greater burden and duration of postoperative morbidity following surgical NEC. Identifying surgical NEC infants at increased risk of moderate/severe BPD and developing lung protection strategies may improve surgical NEC outcomes.",2024,Obstetrics & Gynecology; Pediatrics,0
Evaluation of Trials Comparing Single-Enantiomer Drugs to Their Racemic Precursors A Systematic Review,; CHIRALITY,"IMPORTANCE Chiral switching, a strategy in which drug manufacturers develop a single-enantiomer formulation of a drug to be substituted for a racemic formulation, allows manufacturers to maintain market exclusivity for drugs losing patent protection, even without demonstrating superior efficacy or safety. OBJECTIVE To identify and characterize all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) directly comparing a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved single-enantiomer drug against a previously approved racemic drug for 1 or more efficacy or safety end points. EVIDENCE REVIEW Drugs were identified using the Drugs@FDA database. Randomized clinical trials were identified using Ovid MEDLINE (1949 to October 22, 2019), Ovid Embase (1974 to October 22, 2019), Web of Science Core Collection (all years), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Wiley, Issue 8 of 12, October 22, 2019). Trials were characterized as favoring the single-enantiomer or racemic drugs based on whether the primary efficacy, secondary efficacy, and safety end points achieved each study's defined significance level (eg, P < .05). Trials were characterized as favoring neither drug if no statistically significant differences were reported for any end point or if both drugs were found to be superior for 1 or more separate end points. FINDINGS Fifteen FDA-approved single-enantiomer drugs were identified with racemic precursors approved in the US or Europe. For 3 single-enantiomer racemic drug pairs, no RCTs directly comparing the drugs were identified. For the remaining 12 pairs, 185 RCTs comparing efficacy or safety of the drug pairs were identified, 124 (67.0%) of which studied 1 pair (levobupivacaine/bupivacaine). There were 179 RCTs directly comparing drug pairs using efficacy end points, of which 23 (12.8%) favored the single enantiomer based on primary efficacy end point results. There were 124 RCTs directly comparing drug pairs using safety end points, of which 17 (13.7%) favored the single-enantiomer drug. For 9 of the 15 single-enantiomer drugs (60.0%), no RCTs were identified providing evidence of improved efficacy, based on primary end point results, or safety as compared with their racemic precursors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this systematic review suggest that most newly marketed FDA-approved single-enantiomer drugs are infrequently directly compared with their racemic precursors, and when compared, they are uncommonly found to provide improved efficacy or safety, despite their greater costs.",2021,General & Internal Medicine,0

Recently, increasing evidence indicates an important role for m6A modification in autophagy regulation in MIRI, and SJP has not been investigated in this regard. Methods In vivo experiments were performed in a Wistar rat MIRI model. In vitro assays were conducted in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-treated H9c2 cells. H9c2 cells with ALKBH5 and GSK3 beta silencing were constructed by lentivirus transfection. TUNEL and Annexin V/PI assays were carried out for apoptosis detection. Then, m6A modification was detected with the EpiQuik m6A RNA methylation quantification kit, and GFP-RFP-LC3B was used to observe dynamic changes in autophagy. The autophagosome structure was assessed by Transmission electron microscopy. qPCR and immunoblot were performed for mRNA and protein analyses, receptively. Results SJP significantly mitigated MIRI in rats, reducing infarct size and myocardial apoptosis, and improving left ventricular function. In addition, SJP inhibited autophagy through the GSK3 beta/mTOR pathway in MIRI rats. In cultured H9c2 cells, SJP significantly inhibited H/R- related apoptosis and autophagic activity through the GSK3 beta/mTOR pathway. Additionally, SJP enhanced ALKBH5 expression in H/R cardiomyocytes, which is important in impaired m6A modification. Interestingly, ALKBH5 knockdown enhanced autophagy and apoptosis in H/R-induced cells, whereas SJP reversed these effects. Further experiments showed that autophagic activity and apoptosis enhanced by ALKBH5 deficiency are GSK3 beta/mTOR pathway dependent in H/R-treated H9c2 cells. After SJP administration the above effects were alleviated, suggesting SJP inhibited autophagy through the ALKBH5/GSK3 beta/mTOR pathway in H/R-induced cardiomyocytes. These effects of SJP were common to its two main constituents, including tetra-methylpyrazine (TMP) and borneol (BOR). Conclusion SJP improves MIRI in rats and alleviates autophagy and apoptosis in H9c2 cells through the ALKBH5/GSK3 beta/mTOR pathway, thanks to its two major constituents TMP and BOR.",2023,Integrative & Complementary Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
Leveraging National Germplasm Collections to Determine Significantly Associated Categorical Traits in Crops: Upland and Pima Cotton as a Case Study,trait association; categorical data; cotton; crop germplasm; breeding; PLANT; GENES,"Observable qualitative traits are relatively stable across environments and are commonly used to evaluate crop genetic diversity. Recently, molecular markers have largely superseded describing phenotypes in diversity surveys. However, qualitative descriptors are useful in cataloging germplasm collections and for describing new germplasm in patents, publications, and/or the Plant Variety Protection (PVP) system. This research focused on the comparative analysis of standardized cotton traits as represented within the National Cotton Germplasm Collection (NCGC). The cotton traits are named by 'descriptors' that have non-numerical sub-categories (descriptor states) reflecting the details of how each trait manifests or is absent in the plant. We statistically assessed selected accessions from three major groups of Gossypium as defined by the NCGC curator: (1) Stoneville accessions (SA), containing mainly Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) cultivars; (2) Texas accessions (TEX), containing mainly G. hirsutum landraces; and (3) Gossypium barbadense (Gb), containing cultivars or landraces of Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense). For 33 cotton descriptors we: (a) revealed distributions of character states for each descriptor within each group; (b) analyzed bivariate associations between paired descriptors; and (c) clustered accessions based on their descriptors. The fewest significant associations between descriptors occurred in the SA dataset, likely reflecting extensive breeding for cultivar development. In contrast, the TEX and Gb datasets showed a higher number of significant associations between descriptors, likely correlating with less impact from breeding efforts. Three significant bivariate associations were identified for all three groups, bract nectaries:boll nectaries, leaf hair:stem hair, and lint color:seed fuzz color. Unsupervised clustering analysis recapitulated the species labels for about 97% of the accessions. Unexpected clustering results indicated accessions that may benefit from potential further investigation. In the future, the significant associations between standardized descriptors can be used by curators to determine whether new exotic/unusual accessions most closely resemble Upland or Pima cotton. In addition, the study shows how existing descriptors for large germplasm datasets can be useful to inform downstream goals in breeding and research, such as identifying rare individuals with specific trait combinations and targeting breakdown of remaining trait associations through breeding, thus demonstrating the utility of the analytical methods employed in categorizing germplasm diversity within the collection.",2022,Plant Sciences,0
Application of bilateral internal mammary artery with different configurations in coronary artery bypass grafting,Coronary artery bypass graft; Internal mammary arteries; Transit time flow measurement; ,"Background: A large number of studies have shown that BIMA grafting is superior to single internal mammary artery grafting in cardiac function protection and long-term survival after surgery. While, there is still no consensus on how is the best configuration to use BIMA. This study aims to compare intraoperative blood flow, early clinical results and early postoperative patency of different configurations of BIMA. Methods: There were 74 patients who underwent CABGs with bilateral internal mammary artery with different configurations we included. According to the different target territories that RIMA grafted to, the patients were divided into bilateral group (group I) with 20 cases and left group (group II) with 54 cases. Intraoperative blood flow, early clinical results and early postoperative patency of different configurations of BIMA were compared. Results: There was no difference in the early postoperative death and major complications between group I and Group II(P>0.05). Compared with the LIMA in group II, the LIMA in group I had a slightly higher DF value (76.7 +/- 6.2 vs 73.1 +/- 6.8, P = 0.040). Compared with the RIMA in group II, the RIMA in group I had a slightly higher MGF (51.7 +/- 34.4 ml/min vs 31.4 +/- 21.4 ml/min, P = 0.024). There was no difference in the other TTFM parameters of LIMA and RIMA between group I and Group II(P>0.05). Further subgroup analysis revealed that compared with free RIMA in group II, in situ RIMA had a higher DF value (71.4 +/- 7.8 vs 61.8 +/- 18.1,P = 0.025). The PI of LIMA in free RIMA subgroup was higher than the PI of LIMA in in-situ RIMA subgroup (3.0 +/- 1.6 vs 2.1 +/- 1.0,P = 0.018). The results of early postoperative CTA examination showed that all IMAs grafts were completely patent. Conclusions: The use of BIMA for CABG is safe and efficacious, RIMA used in right coronary artery received more satisfactory graft flow. BIMA with no stenosis and occlusion in the early stage, therefore is the ideal and stable coronary bypass graft.",2021,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Surgery,0
Self-efficacy and entrepreneurial performance of start-ups,Entrepreneurship; Firm performance; General self-efficacy; Survival; Job creation; Innovation; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MEDIATING ROLE; SURVIVAL; GROWTH; CREATIVITY; MOTIVATION; ATTITUDES; SUCCESS; CULTURE,"Plain English SummaryThe self-belief in own abilities to cope with adversity and succeed at an endeavor is called self-efficacy. This belief can outweigh other doubts or self-beliefs such that we can be resilient on our path to reaching goals. Can this belief influence the performance of entrepreneurs with nascent start-ups? Is this influence different for female and male entrepreneurs? Accounting for other factors that might influence business outcomes, we find that self-efficacy alone influences the chances of business survival, having employees, applying for patents or trademark protection, as well as the start-up generated income. On the other hand, we find similar levels of self-efficacy between female and male entrepreneurs, observing that self-efficacy affects the probability of growth-related outcomes for both females and males. This contributes to the understanding of what drives start-up growth and success, which is crucial for the development of target-oriented policies, including training measures, coaching offers, and business incubators. Self-efficacy reflects the self-belief that one can persistently perform difficult and novel tasks while coping with adversity. As such beliefs reflect how individuals behave, think, and act, they are key for successful entrepreneurial activities. While existing literature mainly analyzes the influence of the task-related construct of entrepreneurial self-efficacy, we take a different perspective and investigate, based on a representative sample of 1,405 German business founders, how the personality characteristic of generalized self-efficacy influences start-up performance as measured by a broad set of business outcomes up to 19 months after business creation. Outcomes include start-up survival and entrepreneurial income, as well as growth-oriented outcomes such as job creation and innovation. We find statistically significant and economically important positive effects of high scores of self-efficacy on start-up survival and entrepreneurial income, which become even stronger when focusing on the growth-oriented outcome of innovation. Furthermore, we observe that generalized self-efficacy is similarly distributed between female and male business founders, with effects being partly stronger for female entrepreneurs. Our findings are important for policy instruments that are meant to support firm growth by facilitating the design of more target-oriented offers for training, coaching, and entrepreneurial incubators.",2023,Business & Economics,0
The Impact of Suboxone's Market Exclusivity on Cost of Opioid Use Disorder Treatment,; INTERRUPTED TIME-SERIES; DRUG MARKETS; COMPETITION; CANADA,"BackgroundBuprenorphine-naloxone is an essential part of the response to opioid poisoning rates in North America. Manipulating market exclusivity is a strategy manufacturers use to increase profitability, as evidenced by Suboxone in the USA.ObjectiveTo investigate excess costs of buprenorphine-naloxone due to unmerited market exclusivity (no legal patent or data protection) in Canada.MethodsUsing controlled interrupted time-series, this study examined changes in the cost of buprenorphine-naloxone before and after the first generics were listed on public formularies. Methadone cost was the control. Public data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information in British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan were used. All buprenorphine-naloxone and methadone claims (2010-2019) accepted for payment by the provincial drug plan/programme were collected. Primary outcome was mean cost per mg of buprenorphine-naloxone after the first listing of generics.ResultsMean cost per mg of buprenorphine-naloxone before the first listing of generics was $1.21 CAD in British Columbia, $1.27 CAD in Manitoba, and $0.85 CAD in Saskatchewan. Following the introduction of generics, the cost per mg decreased by $0.22 CAD (95% CI - 0.33 to - 0.10; p = 0.0014) in British Columbia, $0.36 CAD (95% CI - 0.58 to - 0.13; p = 0.004) in Manitoba, and $0.27 CAD (95% CI - 0.50 to - 0.05; p = 0.03) in Saskatchewan. Mean cost per mg decreased by $0.26 CAD (95% CI - 0.38 to - 0.13; p = 0.0004) after a third generic was introduced in British Columbia. Excess costs to public formularies during the 4- to 5-year period prior to the listing of generics were $1,992,558 CAD in British Columbia, $80,876 CAD in Manitoba, and $4130 CAD in Saskatchewan. If buprenorphine-naloxone cost $0.61 CAD (mean cost after the third generic entered) instead of $1.21 CAD per mg during the pre-generics period, public payers in British Columbia could have saved $5,016,220 CAD between 2011 and 2015.ConclusionsUnmerited 6 years of market exclusivity for brand-name buprenorphine-naloxone in Canada resulted in substantial excess costs. There is an urgent need to implement policies that can help reduce costs for high-priority drugs in Canada.",2023,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,0
Maritime Robotics and Autonomous Systems Operations: Exploring Pathways for Overcoming International Techno-Regulatory Data Barriers,robotic and autonomous systems; drones; crawlers; remotely operated vehicles; Internet of Robotic Things; data governance; user interface; international standards; DATA GOVERNANCE,"The current regulatory landscape that applies to maritime service robotics, aptly termed as robotics and autonomous systems (RAS), is quite complex. When it comes to patents, there are multifarious considerations in relation to vessel survey, inspection, and maintenance processes under national and international law. Adherence is challenging, given that the traditional delivery methods are viewed as unsafe, strenuous, and laborious. Service robotics, namely micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) or drones, magnetic-wheeled crawlers (crawlers), and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), function by relying on the architecture of the Internet of Robotic Things. The aforementioned are being introduced as time-saving apparatuses, accompanied by the promise to acquire concrete and sufficient data for the identification of vessel structural weaknesses with the highest level of accuracy to facilitate decision-making processes upon which temporary and permanent measures are contingent. Nonetheless, a noticeable critical issue associated with RAS effective deployment revolves around non-personal data governance, which comprises the main analytical focus of this research effort. The impetus behind this study stems from the need to enquire whether data provisions within the realm of international technological regulatory (techno-regulatory) framework is sufficient, well organized, and harmonized so that there are no current or future conflicts with promulgated theoretical dimensions of data that drive all subject matter-oriented actions. As is noted from the relevant expository research, the challenges are many. Engineering RAS to perfection is not the end-all and be-all. Collateral impediments must be avoided. A safety net needs to be devised to protect non-personal data. The results here indicate that established data decision dimensions call for data security and protection, as well as a consideration of ownership and liability details. An analysis of the state-of-the-art and the comparative results assert that the abovementioned remain neglected in the current international setting. The findings reveal specific data barriers within the existing international framework. The ways forward include strategic actions to remove data barriers towards overall efficacy of maritime RAS operations. The overall findings indicate that an effective transition to RAS operations requires optimizing the international regulatory framework for opening the pathways for effective RAS operations. Conclusions were drawn based on the premise that policy reform is inevitable in order to push the RAS agenda forward before the emanation of 6G and the era of the Internet of Everything, with harmonization and further standardization being very high priority issues.",2021,Engineering; Oceanography,0
Analysis of clinical evidence on traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy: a comprehensive review with evidence mapping,diabetes mellitus; diabetic complications; diabetic nephropathy; traditional Chinese medicine; randomized controlled trials; systematic review; evidence-based analysis; evidence mapping; CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MANAGEMENT; BURDEN,"Objective: This study aims to map evidence from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews/Meta-analyses concerning the treatment of Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), understand the distribution of evidence in this field, and summarize the efficacy and existing problems of TCM in treating DN. The intention is to provide evidence-based data for TCM in preventing and treating DN and to offer a reference for defining future research directions. Methods: Comprehensive searches of major databases were performed, spanning from January 2016 to May 2023, to include clinical RCTs and systematic reviews/Meta-analyses of TCM in treating DN. The analysis encompasses the publishing trend of clinical studies, the staging of research subjects, TCM syndrome differentiation, study scale, intervention plans, and outcome indicators. Methodological quality of systematic reviews was evaluated using the AMSTAR (Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews) checklist, and evidence distribution characteristics were analyzed using a combination of text and charts. Results: A total of 1926 RCTs and 110 systematic reviews/Meta-analyses were included. The majority of studies focused on stage III DN, with Qi-Yin deficiency being the predominant syndrome type, and sample sizes most commonly ranging from 60 to 100. The TCM intervention durations were primarily between 12-24 weeks. Therapeutic measures mainly consisted of Chinese herbal decoctions and patented Chinese medicines, with a substantial focus on clinical efficacy rate, TCM symptomatology, and renal function indicators, while attention to quality of life, dosage of Western medicine, and disease progression was inadequate. Systematic reviews mostly scored between 5 and 8 on the AMSTAR scale, and evidence from 94 studies indicated potential positive effects. Conclusion: DN represents a significant health challenge, particularly for the elderly, with TCM showing promise in symptom alleviation and renal protection. Yet, the field is marred by research inconsistencies and methodological shortcomings. Future investigations should prioritize the development of standardized outcome sets tailored to DN, carefully select evaluation indicators that reflect TCM's unique intervention strategies, and aim to improve the robustness of clinical evidence. Emphasizing TCM's foundational theories while incorporating advanced scientific technologies will be essential for innovating research methodologies and uncovering the mechanisms underlying TCM's efficacy in DN management.",2024,Endocrinology & Metabolism,0

One of them is waste of a biological origin. They are often difficult to dispose of and such a process can be expensive. Increasingly, they are used to produce biofuels that can replace petroleum-based fuels. They are also an alternative to food-based biofuels. The aim of the work was to propose a method of using fatty waste generated in a plant dealing with tanning animal skins and to evaluate the properties of the produced biofuels. The authors decided to use this waste to produce biodiesel. A patented reactor and technology developed by one of the co-authors was used for this purpose. Two alcohols, butyl and methyl, were used to produce esters in the transesterification process. Animal fats butyl esters (AFBE) and animal fats methyl esters (AFME) have been produced. A high efficiency of the transesterification process was obtained. It amounted to 99.2 (wt.%) for AFME and 98.9 (wt.%) for AFBE. The physicochemical properties of AFBE and AFME biodiesels, diesel fuel, and mixtures of these biodiesels and diesel fuel were tested. Most of the tested properties of AFBE were more favourable than those of AFME. The produced AFBE in relation to AFME was characterized by better cetane number, heat of combustion and calorific value, density, dynamic viscosity, kinematic viscosity, and flash point. For example, the kinematic viscosity for AFBE was 3.6 mm(2)/s and for AFME 4.1 mm(2)/s. In contrast, the calorific value of AFBE biodiesel was 39.2 MJ/kg, and that of AFME biodiesel was 38.4 MJ/kg. The use of butanol from the point of view of the properties of the produced biodiesel turned out to be more advantageous in relation to methanol. Due to the fact that the production uses waste fat, the produced biodiesels can be regarded as second-generation biofuels. Producing biodiesel from waste is a way to utilize waste and is beneficial in terms of environmental protection. It can be a way to increase the share of biofuels in the energy balance of regions where large amounts of fat waste products of animal origin are available.",2022,Energy & Fuels,0
In-Situ Fenestration of a PTFE Thoracic Aortic Stent Graft for Delayed Left Subclavian Artery Revascularization Following Frozen Elephant Trunk Repair of Type A Aortic Dissection,; LASER FENESTRATION; ARCH; REPLACEMENT; MANAGEMENT; COVERAGE; OUTCOMES,"Left subclavian artery revascularization during endovascular repair of aortic dissection is often accomplished by left carotid-subclavian artery bypass or transposition. In situ fenestration of thoracic stent grafts provides an alternative method of revascularization without manipulation of the left carotid artery. We describe a case whereby in situ laser fenestration, combined with catheter-directed thrombectomy, was utilized to revascularize a thrombosed left subclavian artery following a frozen elephant trunk repair of type A aortic dissection. A 75-year-old male presented with pericardial tamponade and aortic insufficiency, secondary to type A aortic dissection. Patient underwent an emergent replacement of the aortic root, valve, arch, and ascending aorta in the frozen elephant trunk configuration. The innominate and left carotid arteries were revascularized with a bifurcated bypass graft from the ascending aortic graft. The left subclavian artery (LSCA) was covered with an antegrade deployment of a cTAG stent graft. During the immediate postoperative period, the patient was found to have a dissection of the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and pseudoaneurysm of the bypass graft anastomosis. The left carotid artery was replaced up to the proximal internal carotid. During rehabilitation, the patient developed left subclavian steal syndrome, with a CT angiography demonstrating thrombosis of the subclavian origin, and duplex ultrasound showing a reversal of the left vertebral flow. In order to revascularize the left subclavian artery without using the left carotid as the inflow, the in situ laser fenestration technique was planned. The vertebral artery origin was protected with a neuroclip through a supraclavicular incision. Through a brachial artery cutdown, a 9Fr flex sheath was positioned at the origin of the subclavian artery. A suction thrombectomy catheter was used to create a central channel in the thrombus. A 0.035 '' 3.2 mm over-the-wire laser atherectomy catheter was used to create a fenestration through the cTAG stent graft. The subclavian branch stent was stented with an iCast balloon-expandable covered stent, excluding the mural thrombus. The patient recovered well with resolution of symptoms and was discharged home. Postoperative CT scan showed patent left subclavian branch stent and no endoleak across the fenestration of the aortic stent graft. Delayed laser in situ fenestration of a PTFE stent graft can be performed safely. The vertebral artery protection and catheter-directed thrombectomy are important adjuncts to reduce the risk of posterior stroke.",2020,Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,0
Case Study: Qatar,; ,"Qatar is entirely different from the benchmark countries in terms of its geography, climate, size, mix of population, culture and thus, economic conditions. It is located on the tiny branch out of the Arabian Peninsula in the eastern side of the Arabian Gulf. It is smaller than the size of state of Connecticut with around only 12,000 km(2) of pretty flat and sandy land. The country is considered quite young as it gained its independence in 1971, with small and homogenous native population (i.e., estimated to be around 300,000) as a minority among its quite internationalized total population of around 2.75 million as of 2018. It is almost entirely economically dependent on its abundant oil and gas reserves (i.e., third largest natural gas reserves in the world). The leadership of the country has taken many steps in the past two decades to attempt to transform the hydrocarbon-based economy to knowledge-based economy. The most prominent step among these is the introduction of Qatar National Vision 2030, which sets out the roadmap of economic transformation and human development in Qatar while protecting its physical, natural and cultural environment. In addition, Qatar Foundation (QF), an initiative of the Royal Family, has been phenomenal in Qatar's effort to develop a knowledge ecosystem. At the same time, enacting the law of `Protection of Intellectual Property and Copyright', 'Establishing Free Zone', and `Patents Law' has clearly demonstrated the intentions and determination of the leadership towards a knowledge-based sustainable development. Furthermore, under the umbrella of QF, Qatar is home to eight international branch campuses which help the country in exploiting its local talent on one hand and attracting the foreign talent on the other. Moreover, Qatar has two national universities and three national research institutions operating in proximity of the international branch campuses, science park, and incubation center. The location of knowledge-intensive institutions in close vicinity in the Education City, which is home to the QF and its member institutes and branch campuses, allow these institutions to collaborate and compete at the same time. Other notable institutions playing key roles in the national innovation system are Qatar Development Bank (QDB), Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP), and the recently established Qatar Research Development Innovation (QRDI) council which offer various necessary funding and support programs to lift the innovational and technological quotient of the country to international standards.",2020,Business & Economics; International Relations; Operations Research & Management Science,0
A long lasting sunscreen controversy of 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde derivatives resolved by ultrafast spectroscopy combined with density functional theoretical study,; PARA-AMINOBENZOIC ACID; CHARGE-TRANSFER STATE; EXCITED-STATE; PHOTOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; TRANSIENT ABSORPTION; INTERNAL-CONVERSION; DIPOLE-MOMENTS; DYNAMICS; FLUORESCENCE; PHOTOPROTECTION,"4-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is one of the earliest patented and most commonly used sunscreen components. There is however a long-lasting controversy on its photo-protective efficacy owing to the lack of information on its protolytic equilibrium and photo-dynamics after absorption of ultraviolet radiation in physiologically relevant aqueous solution. The excitation dynamics in water also remains largely unknown for analogs of PABA such as 4-dimethylaminoacetophenone (DMAAP) and 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (DMABA) which are recognized as prototypes for photo-induced twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT). Herein we report a combined application of femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption coupled with density functional theoretical study for PABA, DMAAP, and DMABA under several solvent conditions with representative properties in terms of the pH, polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity. The results we gained demonstrate that, in a neutral aqueous solution, PABA taking the deprotonated anion form in the ground state undergoes rapid protonation after excitation, producing excited state species in the neutral form that may shift effectively by intersystem crossing (ISC) to the long-lasting triplet state capable of damaging nucleic acids. This provides evidence at the molecular level for the detrimental effect of PABA if used as a sunscreen ingredient. In contrast, our investigation on DMAAP and DMABA unveils an unusual solvent controlled deactivation dynamics rendered by the participation of the carbonyl oxygen associated n(O)pi* state featuring energy and structure strongly responsive to solvent properties. In particular, these molecules in water exhibit solute-solvent hydrogen bonding at the sites of the carbonyl oxygen and the amino nitrogen which is, respectively, weakened and strengthened after the excitation, leading to state reversal and formation of a n(O)pi* state with a peculiar non-planar structure. This quenches strongly the excitation, eliminates the TICT, suppresses the ISC and opens up the otherwise inaccessible internal conversion (IC) to account for similar to 80% of the entire deactivation. The IC, observed to proceed at a rate of similar to 2.5 ps, allows the effective recovery of the ground state, providing substantial protection against ultraviolet irradiation. Moreover, the revelation of highly solvent sensitive fluorescence emission from DMABA and DMAAP implies the potential application of these molecules as the functional element in the design of sensory materials for probing the polarity and hydrogen bonding character of the surrounding environment.",2020,Chemistry; Physics,0
Contribution to research on ground heat storages as part of building energy systems using RES,Ground heat storage (GHS); Renewable energy sources (RES); Active thermal protection (ATP); thermal barrier (TB). Energy (solar) roof (ERS); Combined building-energy systems; Geothermic energy; Solar energy; DESIGN; FLUX,"Intensive research in the field of long-term or seasonal storage and use of heat from RES (especially solar and geothermic energy) in ground heat storage (GHS) has been going on for a long time and researchers from all over the world have published a number of remarkable results, innovative technical solutions and information in their studies. Nevertheless, this area of research remains very topical and promising, as it can provide further new insights and useful technical solutions. Following the research results presented by authors from all over the world, in this study we describe our contribution to the research on GHS as part of building energy systems with RES. In our long-term research, since about 2004, we have been inspired by the patented technical solution of the ISOMAX system (by Edmond D. KRECKE). We are studying this system in detail, innovated the original way of operation of the combined building-energy system and created variants of operation in different modes of heat sources and energy systems. We have also developed prototypes of new components. We designed, projected, managed the construction and experimental measurements of the IDA I prefabricated house prototype, the EB2020 experimental house and the mobile laboratory (simulator and optimizer of smart compact devices). The novelty and originality of our research results in this field are summarized in three utility models and one European patent. The research and experimental measurements described in this study were carried out on the experimental house EB2020. In particular, we focused on the quantification of the energy harvested from the ESR and the realistic possibility of long-term storage of this energy in the GHS. The amount of stored energy from the peak heat source - a fireplace with a hot water heat exchanger - was also the research subject. We investigated the possibility of using the stored heat for application in active thermal protection (ATP) in building envelopes for low-temperature radiant large-area heating and the function of the thermal barrier (TB). In the theoretical calculations, the house foundation slab (area 100 m(2), thickness 0.2 m) as a GHS is not sufficient to cover the requirements for low-temperature large-area radiant heating and TB in the building envelope in the long term or all year round. Without taking into account heat losses, 1 kW of power for ATP could only be delivered for less than 14 days at charge GHS on 30 degrees C and 25 days at 50 degrees C. The results of the simplified calculation of the volume, energy balance and energy efficiency of the GHS were verified by experimental measurements. The experimental measurements were carried out during one charging season (values taken into account from 10 July, i.e. from the start of operation of the solar roof in 2011) and one discharging season (one heating period). Based on the analysis of the theoretical calculations and the results of experimental measurements, the use of the accumulated heat in the GHS in the experimental house EB2020 is limited due to the composition of the building envelope. Even though it is not efficient to use the heat in the ATP also for large-scale radiant heating in this case, it represents a high potential of energy savings for the application as a TB function by significantly eliminating heat losses/gains. At a mean temperature of the heat transfer medium of 13 degrees C in the ATP, a function of the TB, the wall of the house would have an equivalent thermal resistance corresponding to the thermal insulation of 500 mm. At the medium temperatures of the heat transfer medium required for large-scale radiant wall heating, due to the high thermal resistance of the load-bearing part of the walls, the application of ATP in the envelope structures of this experimental house is ineffective in the heating function and the heat from the ground heat store is quickly exhausted. Experimental measurements showed the highly energy-efficient use of ATP for passive cooling using a TB and cold from a long-term ground cold storage - circuits of pipes buried at a depth of about 1.5 to 3 m outside the building. Using only electricity to drive the pumps in the cooling circuits and the thermal barrier, temperatures up to 28 degrees C were measured indoors with outdoor temperatures above 34 degrees C. Based on these research results, it is possible to recommend the use of GHS in cooperation with ATP also in the heating/cooling function only for the building envelope, the load-bearing part of which is made of a material with high thermal conductivity, i.e. low thermal resistance, for example as reinforced concrete. Theoretical calculations, experimental measurements and analyses have identified important facts that need to be taken into account in the calculation, design, assessment and planning of buildings with ground heat storage, and also point to the need for further research in this area, as these technical solutions have a high potential for a significant use of RES in accordance with Directive 2018/844/EU, to meet the requirements for Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs). Not only climate change, but also military conflicts such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine point to the need for an urgent transition to technical solutions using RES to replace fossil fuels. GHS as part of building energy systems, represents promising technical solutions available to everyone and almost everywhere. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Sanqi oral solution ameliorates renal fibrosis by suppressing fibroblast activation via HIF-1α/PKM2/glycolysis α /PKM2/glycolysis pathway in chronic kidney disease,Sanqi oral solution; HIF-1 alpha/PKM2 pathway; Glycolysis; Fibroblast; Reno-protection; TUBULOINTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS; UP-REGULATION; HIF-1-ALPHA; CELLS; RATS; GLYCOLYSIS,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Sanqi oral solution (SQ) is a traditional Chinese patent medicine, widely used to treat chronic kidney diseases (CKD) in the clinic in China. Previous studies have confirmed its anti-renal fibrosis effect, but the specific pharmacological mechanism is still unclear. Aim of the study: Focusing on energy metabolism in fibroblasts, the renoprotective mechanism of SQ was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Firstly, the fingerprint of SQ was constructed and its elementary chemical composition was analyzed. In the 5/6Nx rats experiment, the efficacy of SQ on the kidney was evaluated by detecting serum and urine biochemical indexes and pathological staining of renal tissues. Lactic acid and pyruvic acid levels in serum and renal tissues were detected. PCNA protein expression in kidney tissue was detected by immunofluorescence assay and Western blot. Expression levels of HIF-1 alpha, PKM2 and HK2 were determined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot or RT-qPCR assay. In addition, the effect of SQ intervention on cell proliferation and glycolysis was evaluated in TGF-beta 1-induced NRK-49F cells, and the role of SQ exposure and HIF-1 alpha/PKM2/glycolysis pathway were further investigated by silencing and overexpressing HIF-1 alpha gene in NRK-49F cells. Results: In 5/6 Nx rats, SQ effectively improved renal function and treated renal injury. It reduced the levels of lactic acid and pyruvic acid in kidney homogenates from CKD rats and decreased the expression levels of HIF-1 alpha, PKM2, HK2, alpha-SMA, vimentin, collagen I and PCNA in kidney tissues. Similar results were observed in vitro. SQ inhibited NRK-49F cell proliferation, glycolysis and the expression levels of HIF-1 alpha, PKM2 induced by TGF-beta 1. Furthermore, we established NRK-49F cells transfected with siRNA or pDNA to silence or overexpress the HIF-1 alpha gene. Overexpression of HIF-1 alpha promoted cellular secretion of lactic acid and pyruvic acid in TGF-beta 1-induced NRK-49F cells, however, this change was reversed by intervention with SQ or silencing the HIF-1 alpha gene. Overexpression of HIF-1 alpha can further induce increased PKM2 expression, while SQ intervention can reduce PKM2 expression. Moreover, PKM2 expression was also inhibited after silencing HIF-1 alpha gene, and SQ was not effective even when given. Conclusion: The mechanism of action of SQ was explored from the perspective of energy metabolism, and it was found to regulate PKM2-activated glycolysis, inhibit fibroblast activation, and further ameliorate renal fibrosis in CKD by targeting HIF-1 alpha.",2024,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,0
Fufang-zhenzhu-tiaozhi formula protects islet against injury and promotes β cell regeneration in diabetic mice,Fufang-zhenzhu-tiaozhi formula; Diabetes mellitus; ? cell regeneration; PDX-1; MAFA; NGN3; SERUM; MASS; RAT,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Fufang-zhenzhu-tiaozhi formula (FTZ) is a patented preparation of traditional Chinese medicine that has been used to treat hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in the clinic for almost 10 years. Our previous study had demonstrated that FTZ can protect islet beta cell injury in vitro. However, the efficacy of FTZ on beta cell regeneration in vivo and the involved anti-diabetic mechanism remains unknown.Aim of the study: We aim to investigate the effects of FTZ as a good remedy for islet protection and beta cell regeneration, and to reveal the underlying mechanism. Materials and methods: C57BL/6 mice were fed with high-fat diet for 3 weeks and then intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (90 mg/kg/d x 1 d) to establish type 2 diabetes (T2D) models. Mice in each group were divided into three batches that sacrificed after 3, 7 and 28 days of FTZ administration. Body weight, blood glucose, and oral glucose tolerance test were measured at indicated time points. Fasting insulin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Neonatal beta cell was assessed by insulin & PCNA double immunofluorescence staining, and the underlying mechanisms related to beta cell regeneration were further per-formed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, insulin & glucagon double immunofluorescence staining and Western blot.Results: FTZ and metformin can significantly help with the symptoms of DM, such as alleviating weight loss, reducing blood glucose, improving the level of insulin in vivo, and relieving insulin resistance, suggesting FTZ and metformin treatment maintained the normal morphological function of islet. Notably, beta cell regeneration, which is indicated by insulin and PCNA double-positive cells, was promoted by FTZ, whereas few neonatal beta cells were observed in metformin group. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, and its quantification results showed that FTZ effectively prevented the invasion of inflammatory cells into the islets in diabetic mice. Most beta cells in the islets of diabetic model mice were devoid, and the islets were almost all alpha cells, while the diabetic mice administered FTZ could still maintain about half of the beta cells in the islet. Furthermore, FTZ upregulated the expression of critical transcription factors during beta cell development and maturation (such as PDX-1, MAFA and NGN3) in diabetic mice.Conclusions: FTZ can alleviate diabetes symptoms and promote beta cell regeneration in diabetic mice. Moreover, FTZ promotes beta cell regeneration by preserving islet (resisting inflammatory cells invading islets), maintaining the number of beta cells in islets, and increasing the expression of PDX-1, MAFA and NGN3.",2023,Plant Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Integrative & Complementary Medicine,0
Policies to promote breeding for lice-resistant salmon: Incentives designed for resilient and sustainable growth in aquaculture,Atlantic salmon; fish welfare; genetic resistance; policy instruments; regulation; salmon lice; selective breeding; GENETIC-RESOURCES; PROTECTION; ACCESS; EFFICIENCY,"Sea lice represent a persistent and growing problem, challenging the resilience and growth of the salmon aquaculture industry. In this Norwegian case study, we studied and discuss how the absence of policy instruments directed at stimulating breeding for lice resistance (LR) might be explained. We found well-documented opportunities for selection progress for LR. Hence, breeding on LR appears with an untapped potential. We discuss how market-based, legal, institutional and interest-based factors can explain the absence of policy instruments stimulating LR breeding. Methodologically, we obtained data from document and literature studies and interviews with key players (salmon breeders, farmers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and governmental bodies in Norway). First, LR is a polygenic trait, which makes it poorly suited for patenting. Furthermore, if only a small proportion of fish farmers choose seeds with higher LR, other operators can easily take on the free-rider role because they will not suffer from reduced gain in growth performance as a result of a much stronger emphasis on LR in the breeding goal. The market is thus not expected to stimulate stronger selection for LR in Norwegian salmon breeding. Second, neither genetic engineering (e.g., gene editing), still struggling with consumer acceptance, nor the uncertainty associated with possible changes in the Norwegian Gene Technology Act stimulate investment in LR via, for example, CRISPR technology. Thirdly, public policy instruments in their entirety have targeted other types of innovations against salmon lice, and none have so far been used to stimulate breeding companies to emphasize LR more strongly in their breeding programmes. From a political point of view, it seems that breeding has been left to the market and the private sector. However, neither the NGOs nor the public seem to be aware of, or pay significant attention to, the breeding potential to improve LR and fish welfare. Fragmented management of the aquaculture sector can camouflage the close ties between political and business interests. The industry is hesitant to invest significantly in long-term breeding targets such as significantly higher genetic LR. This may strengthen the assumption that strong economic interests will reduce the role of science in knowledge-based management. As farmed salmon are increasingly being exposed to stressful delousing treatments, mortality and associated welfare problems have increased significantly. For instance, large fish die more often from cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS), resulting in growing demand for CMS-resistant salmon. This gives rise to a paradoxical situation: increasing treatments with high mortality and fish welfare issues in farmed salmon, while the lice threat to wild salmon persists.",2023,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,0
The effect of ESG performance on corporate green innovation,ESG performance; Green innovation; Government regulation; Sustainable development; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT,"PurposeThe transition to green growth goals requires the concerted efforts of the whole society. Enterprises, as important players in the market, play a key role in promoting green and sustainable development. The rise of the concept of sustainable development has enabled more enterprises to disclose environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, and ESG behaviour is regarded as a positive strategic behaviour to implement the new development concept. This paper aims to explore the influence of ESG performance on enterprise green innovation.Design/methodology/approachThis study applies a fixed effect model and the regulation effect of empirical analysis to explore the influence of ESG performance on enterprise green innovation. The object of investigation is 2014-2021 Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies.FindingsThe results of an empirical analysis outline the following conclusions: (1) ESG performance has a significant effect on enterprise green innovation, mainly by easing the pressure of the financing enterprise, fitting stakeholders' environmental protection concept and obtaining employee organizational identity that influences enterprise green innovation. (2) Government regulation positively regulates the role of ESG performance in promoting the green innovation of enterprises. (3) Heterogeneity analysis found that the strengthening role of ESG performance on the green innovation of enterprises is stronger in green invention patents, state-owned enterprises and nonheavily polluting industries.Research limitations/implicationsDespite the valuable findings, this study has a few limitations. Thus, it is necessary to extend the object of investigation by adding other Asian countries, which allows for comparison analysis and allocating best practices for promoting green innovation. Besides, innovation and ESG performance depend on the quality of institutions. In this case, the future study should incorporate the indicators that reveal the quality of institutions (corruption, transparency, digitalisation, voice, accountability, etc.).Practical implicationsAccording to the above conclusions, this paper proposes suggestions at the level of enterprises, government and investors. At the enterprise level, ESG responsibility should be strengthened, ESG information should be consciously disclosed and the quality of ESG disclosure should be improved. Government departments should play the role of supervisors, improve the construction of ESG information disclosure systems and promote the formation of ESG systems. At the social level, investors should improve the ESG information status and pay more attention to the ESG performance of enterprises.Originality/valueThis study fills the scientific gaps in the analysis impact of ESG performance on the green innovation of enterprises. This paper contributes to the theoretical landscape of ESG efficiency by developing approaches based on two empirical models: testing the impact of enterprise ESG performance on green innovation and testing whether government regulation plays a regulatory role in the relationship between ESG performance and green innovation. Besides, this study analysed the ESG performance and green innovation within the following categories: heavy and nonheavy polluter industries; state and nonstate-owned enterprise groups.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Using Fenestrated and Branched Endovascular Grafts for High-Risk Patients: Evolving yet Safe,FEVAR; TEVAR; BEVAR; thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair; endovascular aneurysm repair; SPINAL-CORD PROTECTION; OPEN SURGICAL REPAIR; STENT GRAFTS; OUTCOMES; METAANALYSIS; DURABILITY; ISCHEMIA,"Purpose: The purpose was to investigate outcomes of high-risk patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair using fenestrated or branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F/BEVAR) devices at a single center in Canada.Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing endovascular TAAA repair with F/BEVAR from June 2007 to July 2020. Imaging and clinical endpoints of interest including death, reintervention, and target vessel patency were reported.Results: Ninety-five consecutive patients underwent endovascular TAAA repair using F/BEVAR stent grafts (63 males, median age 74 [interquartile range 70, 78] years). Repairs included 81 elective and 14 urgent/emergent cases (6 ruptures and 8 symptomatic). Graft deployment was 100% successful. Intraoperative target vessel revascularization was successful in 336/355 (94.6%) vessels with the celiac having the lowest success rate 72/82 (87.8%). In-hospital mortality was 9.5% (7.4% elective and 21.4% urgent/emergent, p=0.125) and permanent paraplegia was 4.2% (3.7% elective and 7.1% urgent/emergent, p=0.458). In-hospital complications included stroke in 5.3%, acute myocardial infarction in 8.4%, and bowel ischemia in 5.3%. No patients required permanent dialysis or tracheostomy during their hospital stay. However, 22 (23.2%) patients required additional unplanned procedures for various indications (branch occlusion, endoleaks, realignment) during their hospital stay. Patients were followed up for a mean of 3.6 +/- 3.0 years. Clinical follow-up was 100%, with 80/86 (93%) having surveillance imaging. On follow-up imaging, 43 (50%) patients had at least 1 endoleak identified and 337/341 (98.8%) of the target vessels were found to be patent. At 5 years, cumulative probability of reintervention was 46.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.1-56.4). Survival at 5 and 8 years was 50.1% (95% CI, 38.4-65.4) and 34.4% (95% CI, 22.5-52.8), respectively. Progression of aneurysmal disease leading to rupture on follow-up was confirmed in 1 patient at 10 years.Conclusion: Endovascular TAAA repair provides a safe treatment option with a high technical success rate and low pulmonary and renal complications. Long-term survival is similar to previous literature; however, high rates of secondary reintervention reaffirm the need for ongoing patient follow-up and further technical improvements.Clinical Impact This study demonstrates that endovascular repair of TAAAs can be performed in a high-risk elderly population with acceptable rates of mortality, TALE and SCI, using evolving technology. The incidences of post-operative respiratory failure and renal dysfunction were lower in patients who underwent endovascular repair compared with open repair. Future technical and procedural refinements in addition to increasing surgical experience are expected to lead to further improvements in short- and long-term outcomes exceeding those of open repair.",2024,Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,0
MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT IN INSURANCE: IMPACT OF INNOVATIONS MEASURES,insurance marketing; insurance management; insurance technologies; innovations; the Innovations index; innovative development; Principal Component Analysis; Multifactor regression model; ,"Nowadays insurance industry has huge innovation potential. Several key vectors for developing the concept of insurance tech include machine learning, business analytics, consumer protection rules, Big Data, artificial intelligence, neural networks, blockchain, and telematics. Technological innovations become widespread only when a community that supports them emerges, and COVID-19 has rapidly accelerated the changes that were already in full swing to a greater extent than any other factor. COVID-19 has helped reinforce the story and ilustrate the results that technologies achieve on a large scale. Modern marketing and management approaches in insurance are viewed as an activity to optimize and control the insurance company's innovation and marketing activities. It would allow taking a strategicaly advantageous position in the insurance market. There are two kinds of insurance marketing: structural and commodity. Structural marketing could help to solve the problem of the economic efficiency of the activity of insurance companies. Commodity marketing helps to improve financial activity and, as a result, to increase profitability. This article summarizes the arguments and counterarguments within the scientific discussion on the place and prospects marketing and management in insurance (strategies, functions, principles) in the context of key innovation metrics. The study's primary purpose is to confirm the hypothesis about the functional link between the level of innovative development of the country and key insurance determinants as drivers for transformation in marketing strategies of insurance companies. In this regard, the array of input data is presented in the form of seven independent variables (regressors), six of which denote innovation measures, one is control variable, and five dependent variables (regressands), which identify the insurance sector. The study of the impact of innovation metrics on the insurance sector of the country in the article is carried out in the following logical sequence: 1) the formation of an array of input data; selection of relevant indicators using Principal Component Analysis; 2) formalization of functional relationships between variables by constructing five-panel Multifactor regression models with Random Effects; and 3) interpretation of the obtained results. Seventeen countries of Central and Eastern Europe were selected as the object of the study for the period from 2004 till 2019. The study empirically confirms the above hypothesis, which is evidenced by the following identified dependences. Key insurance determinants depend on innovation fluctuations. The most significant positive influence on the dependent variables is exercised by the Innovations index, Research and development expenditure, and Patent applications by residents. The study results could be helpful for insurance companies that provide new insurance technologies and seek to optimize activities to support innovative development. The main directions of marketing and management in insurance should be considered from two positions applying new technologies in insurance marketing and introducing new insurance products or services.",2021,Business & Economics,0

But the holistic chemical information and potential bioactive components of DDTNC on protecting BMECs and its underlying mechanism is still unclear. Aim of the study: To identify the active ingredients of DDTNC and to explore the protective effects of DDTNC on BMECs associated with Wnt/13-catenin pathway. Materials and methods: The components of DDTNC and cerebrospinal fluid containing composition of DDTNC (DDTNC-CSF) were detected by High performance liquid chromatography combined with Diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS), respectively. The experiment rat model was established with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the therapeutic effects of DDTNC were assessed by Longa assay and TTC staining. The cerebral micro vessel density was determined by immunofluorescence staining. The injured BMECs caused by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) was used to evaluate the protective effect of cerebrospinal fluid containing composition of DDTNC (DDTNC-CSF). The cell survival rate was detected by the method of CCK8, the intracellular Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was estimated by Fluo-3. Moreover, the proteins of Bax, Bcl-2, Wnt, 13-catenin, GSK-313 was determined by Western blotting. Results: The RSD values of all methodological studies were less than 3.0%. A total of 20 compounds were detected under the optimized HPLC-DAD chromatographic condition. In the UPLC-Q-TOF-MS negative mode, peak 1 and peak 2 were detecteted in DDTNC-CSF and was identified as Danshensu and Puerarin, respectively. In the UPLCQ-TOF-MS positive mode, peak 1 and peak 3 were detecteted in DDTNC-CSF and was identified as Danshensu and Scutellarin, respectively. DDTNC significantly decreased the Longa values and infarct volume and significantly increased the cerebral microvessel density of the MCAO rats. The accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ and ROS in BMECs injured by OGD/R decreased significantly in DDTNC-CSF group. The expression of Bcl-2, 13-cat-enin, wnt-1 was upregulated by DDTNC-CSF and the level of Bax and GSK313 could be downregulated by DDTNCCSF.

Antibody responses to a suite of novel serological markers for malaria surveillance demonstrate strong correlation with clinical and parasitological infection across seasons and transmission settings in The Gambia,Malaria; Serology; Surveillance; FALCIPARUM MEROZOITE ANTIGENS; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; SURFACE PROTEIN-1; GENETIC DIVERSITY; PROTECTION; AGE; ASSOCIATION; EXPOSURE; EFFICACY; TARGET,"Background As malaria transmission declines, sensitive diagnostics are needed to evaluate interventions and monitor transmission. Serological assays measuring malaria antibody responses offer a cost-effective detection method to supplement existing surveillance tools. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in 12 villages across five administrative regions in The Gambia. Serological analysis included samples from the West Coast Region at the start and end of the season (July and December 2013) and from the Upper River Region in July and December 2013 and April and December 2014. Antigen-specific antibody responses to eightPlasmodium falciparum(P. falciparum) antigens-Etramp5.Ag1, GEXP18, HSP40.Ag1, Rh2.2030, EBA175 RIII-V,PfMSP1(19),PfAMA1, andPfGLURP.R2-were quantified using a multiplexed bead-based assay. The association between antibody responses and clinical and parasitological endpoints was estimated at the individual, household, and population level. Results Strong associations were observed between clinical malaria and concurrent sero-positivity to Etramp5.Ag1 (aOR 4.60 95% CI 2.98-7.12),PfMSP1(19)(aOR 4.09 95% CI 2.60-6.44),PfAMA1 (aOR 2.32 95% CI 1.40-3.85), andPfGLURP.R2 (aOR 3.12, 95% CI 2.92-4.95), while asymptomatic infection was associated with sero-positivity to all antigens. Village-level sero-prevalence amongst children 2-10 years against Etramp5.Ag1, HSP40.Ag1, andPfMSP1(19)showed the highest correlations with clinical andP. falciparuminfection incidence rates. For all antigens, there were increased odds of asymptomaticP. falciparuminfection in subjects residing in a compound with greater than 50% sero-prevalence, with a 2- to 3-fold increase in odds of infection associated with Etramp5.Ag1, GEXP18, Rh2.2030,PfMSP1(19), andPfAMA1. For individuals residing in sero-positive compounds, the odds of clinical malaria were reduced, suggesting a protective effect. Conclusions At low transmission, long-lived antibody responses could indicate foci of malaria transmission that have been ongoing for several seasons or years. In settings where sub-patent infections are prevalent and fluctuate below the detection limit of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the presence of short-lived antibodies may indicate recent infectivity, particularly in the dry season when clinical cases are rare. Serological responses may reflect a persistent reservoir of infection, warranting community-targeted interventions if individuals are not clinically apparent but have the potential to transmit. Therefore, serological surveillance at the individual and household level may be used to target interventions where there are foci of asymptomatically infected individuals, such as by measuring the magnitude of age-stratified antibody levels or identifying areas with clustering of above-average antibody responses across a diverse range of serological markers.",2020,General & Internal Medicine,0
Traditional Chinese Medicine Compound (Tongxinluo) and Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction The CTS-AMI Randomized Clinical Trial,; MICROVASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; VULNERABLE PLAQUES; REPERFUSION INJURY; DOUBLE-BLIND; NO-REFLOW; PROTECTION; ELEVATION; ISCHEMIA; PATHWAY; ENOS,"IMPORTANCE Tongxinluo, a traditional Chinese medicine compound, has shown promise in in vitro, animal, and small human studies for myocardial infarction, but has not been rigorously evaluated in large randomized clinical trials. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether Tongxinluo could improve clinical outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted among patients with STEMI within 24 hours of symptom onset from 124 hospitals in China. Patients were enrolled from May 2019 to December 2020; the last date of follow-up was December 15, 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either Tongxinluo or placebo orally for 12 months (a loading dose of 2.08 g after randomization, followed by the maintenance dose of 1.04 g, 3 times a day), in addition to STEMI guideline-directed treatments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was 30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), a composite of cardiac death, myocardial reinfarction, emergent coronary revascularization, and stroke. Follow-up for MACCEs occurred every 3 months to 1 year. RESULTS Among 3797 patients who were randomized, 3777 (Tongxinluo: 1889 and placebo: 1888; mean age, 61 years; 76.9% male) were included in the primary analysis. Thirty-day MACCEs occurred in 64 patients (3.4%) in the Tongxinluo group vs 99 patients (5.2%) in the control group (relative risk [RR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.88]; risk difference [RD], -1.8% [95% CI, -3.2% to -0.6%]). Individual components of 30-day MACCEs, including cardiac death (56 [3.0%] vs 80 [4.2%]; RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.99]; RD, -1.2% [95% CI, -2.5% to -0.1%]), were also significantly lower in the Tongxinluo group than the placebo group. By 1 year, the Tongxinluo group continued to have lower rates of MACCEs (100 [5.3%] vs 157 [8.3%]; HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.49 to 0.82]; RD, -3.0% [95% CI, -4.6% to -1.4%]) and cardiac death (85 [4.5%] vs 116 [6.1%]; HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.97]; RD, -1.6% [95% CI, -3.1% to -0.2%]). There were no significant differences in other secondary end points including 30-day stroke; major bleeding at 30 days and 1 year; 1-year all-cause mortality; and in-stent thrombosis (<24 hours; 1-30 days; 1-12 months). More adverse drug reactions occurred in the Tongxinluo group than the placebo group (40 [2.1%] vs 21 [1.1%]; P=.02), mainly driven by gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with STEMI, the Chinese patent medicine Tongxinluo, as an adjunctive therapy in addition to STEMI guideline-directed treatments, significantly improved both 30-day and 1-year clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism of action of Tongxinluo in STEMI.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,0
Asymmetries in the euro area and TFP growth: evidence from three major European economies,European asymmetries; TFP; Interest rate; Exchange rate; Labor market; Wage rate; C22; D21; D24; EXCHANGE-RATE; EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION; TECHNICAL CHANGE; PRODUCTIVITY; TECHNOLOGY,"Purpose In this paper, the authors study the long-run determinants of total factor productivity (TFP) in three major European economies over the period 1983-2017, namely Germany, France and Italy. Design/methodology/approach The authors focus on the capital misallocation effects, scale effects and labor misallocation effects. To this end, the authors study how real interest rate shocks, real exchange rate shocks, real wage shocks and changes in labor regulation affected TFP in major European countries over the last decades. The authors employ a theoretical and an empirical model to investigate the issue. The empirical results are obtained using a VAR model for estimation. Findings A stripped-down model of labor market in open economy with technology progress allows to identify the relevant variables affecting TFP. On the empirical ground, the authors find a positive relationship between TFP and real interest rate in the long run. Importantly, the authors detect a positive relationship between TFP and real exchange rate. Further, the authors show that the TFP can respond positively to a stricter labor market regulation and to a higher real compensation per employee. The results provide support to the idea that TFP has a positive relation with prices in the long run, while it may be biased along the cycle because of price rigidity. Research limitations/implications The present model is stylized and may not capture all of the details of reality. The analysis should be extended to a larger number of countries. Technology progress could be proxied using different variables, as the R&D expenditure or the number of patents. Micro data, for specific sectors and industries, can improve the quality of the empirical investigation. Practical implications Mainly the authors find that TFP has a positive relationship with price changes in the long run, while it may be biased along the cycle because of price stickiness. Capital misallocation and labor misallocation can negatively affect TFP. Thus, the observed divergences in European TFP can be traced back to the misallocation effects attributable to the decrease of real interest rate and real wages, together with the raising labor flexibility. Mainly, the authors detect a positive long-run relationship between TFP and real exchange rate. This outcome strengthens the supply-side view of the relationship between productivity and real exchange rate. Social implications The authors believe that the present setup can be helpful to reflect critically on the nodes at the core of the productivity slowdown and asymmetries in the eurozone. The aim is to implement renewed policies in order to favor economic growth, convergence and stability in the euro area. Originality/value This research addresses the issue of asymmetries among European economies by focusing on the role played by real prices in the long run. Traditionally, the dynamics of TFP have been attributed only to technological components, human capital and knowledge. This work shows that the dynamics of prices such as the real interest rate, the real exchange rate and the real wage can also influence the technological process by pushing the production system toward choices that are not always optimal for economic growth. An interesting result of this research concerns the positive relationship between real exchange rates and TFP in the long term, evidence of an important supply-side effect on the technological process.",2021,Business & Economics,0
Deregulation of short-selling and green innovation of enterprises: quasi-natural experiment of margin trading policy,Securities margin trading; Deregulation of short-selling; Green innovation; Quasi-natural experiment; CORPORATE CASH HOLDINGS; SHORT-SALES CONSTRAINTS; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; ANALYST COVERAGE; PRICE DISCOVERY; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; INVESTMENT; IMPACT; PHILANTHROPY,"PurposeThe reform and opening-up of capital market is valued for promoting sustainable development, while its impact presented as the form of deregulation of short-selling on the green innovation of enterprises in developing countries remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to outline the significance of gradual reform of financial markets in developing countries for low-carbon transformation and provide implications for achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.Design/methodology/approachBased on the green subdivided patent data and financial data of China's A-share listed companies, this paper takes the implementation of securities margin trading program as a quasi-natural experiment and applies the difference-in-differences (DID) model to examine the impact of deregulation of short-selling constraints on the enterprises' green transformation.FindingsThe findings reveal that the initiating securities margin trading program significantly enhances the green innovation performance of enterprises. These findings are valid after performing a series of robustness tests such as the parallel trend test, the placebo test and the methods to exclude other policy interference. Mechanism analyses demonstrate a two-faceted effect of the securities margin trading program on the green innovation of enterprises, in which short-selling policy increases the pressure on capital market deregulation and meanwhile induces the environmental protection investment. The heterogeneity results demonstrate that the impulsive effect imposed by securities margin trading program is more significant in experimental group samples with characteristics of lower financing constraints, belonging to heavy polluting industries and possessing better environmental supervision capability.Originality/valueFirst, previous studies have focused on the impact of financial policies implemented by banking institutions on the green innovation of enterprises, but few literatures have explored the validity of relaxing short-selling restrictions or opening the capital market in the field of enterprise's green transformation in developing country. From the view of securities market reform, this paper broadens the incentive and supervision effects of the relaxation of short-selling control on enterprise's green innovation performance after the implementation of securities financing and securities lending policy in China's capital market. Second, previous studies have explored the impact of command-and-control environmental regulations, as well as market-incentivized environmental regulations such as green finance, low-carbon pilots and environmental tax reform, on the green transition of enterprises. Recently the role of the securities market in the green development of enterprises has received more attention in academia. The pilot of margin financing and securities lending is essentially a market-incentivized regulatory tool, but there is few in-depth research on how it affects the green innovation of enterprises. This paper enriches the research on whether the market incentive financial regulation policy can contribute to the green transformation of enterprises under the Porter hypothesis. Third, some previous studies used the ordinary panel regression model to explore the impact of financial policy on enterprise's innovation performance. However, due to the potential endogenous problems of the estimated model, it might get biased conclusions. Therefore, based on the method of quasi-natural experiment, this paper selects the margin trading pilot policy as an exogenous shock to solve the endogenous or reverse causality problem in traditional measurement model and applies the DID model to study the relationship between core indicator variables.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Natural fermentation of fresh Jasmine flowers inspired the development of a biotechnological ingredient with global anti-ageing properties,green technology; ingredients; phytobiome; phytofermentation; ,"ObjectiveThis study focused on the development of a new-to-world ingredient harnessing the natural potential of fresh Jasminum grandiflorum flowers to self-ferment by its phytobiome revealing flower content. Analytical investigations were conducted to highlight specific phytocompounds generated during the natural fermentation of flowers in comparison to a conventional extraction. The synergy with another extraction technology maximized the generation of biocompounds for an interesting efficacy.MethodsJasmine extract was elaborated by combining two patented technologies: the phytofermentology (TM), inspired by plant-microorganisms interaction and designed to develop ingredients obtained by natural fermentation of the vegetal using its own phytobiota; and the PSR (TM) technology allowing the extraction of bioactive phytocompounds such as small RNAs from plants.ResultsAnalytical investigations of Jasmine extract highlighted uniqueness and richness of the phytocompound profiles, such as organics acids and phenolic compounds, markers of fermentation only obtained after phytofermentology in comparison to conventional extraction. Jasmine extract has the particularity to contain jasmintides, flower small peptides belonging to the family of cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs). Antioxidant and global anti-ageing properties were investigated in cell-free assays demonstrating interesting results: about 20% scavenging of free radicals from 0.5% of Jasmine extract and protection from DNA damage of 26% in comparison to a stressed control.ConclusionPhytofermentology (TM) technology combined with PSR (TM) technology, meant to be respectful of the environment, allowed to development of biofunctionals very close to nature with a unique analytical signature as Jasmine extract, using the potential of fresh flowers phytobiota to self-ferment. The efficacy of the ingredient on global antioxidation and anti-ageing via hyaluronidase/tyrosinase inhibitions was highlighted by cell-free evaluation assays. Further and complementary studies should be conducted to confirm the bioefficacy of this ingredient with in vitro / ex vivo assays.

Evaluation of European business innovation policies in the environmental technology in- dustry: Analysis of the implementation of the ERDF-Innterconecta Programme of the Tech- nology Fund 2007-2013 in Galicia,R & D & I policies; Environmental Innovation; Technology Fund; Evaluation of eco-innovation policies; Regional development; ECO-INNOVATION; GREEN; PERFORMANCE; ECONOMICS; BARRIERS,"The aim of this study is to assess on the impact of the regional innovation policies in the business environmental sector in Galicia throughout the implementation of the Operational Programme for the benefit of business R & D & i-Technology Fund 2007-2013, which was a unique instrument of innovation policies financed by the Structural Funds of the European Union and directed to the Spanish autonomous communities belonging to the Convergence Objective. The proposed analysis intendeds to identify the results of this multiannual programme, which mobilized a significant volume of resources for innovation and whose implementation is scheduled until 2015, on the evolution of the environmental technology field. To this end, the different types of measures and actions financed in this programme and their effects on the main innovation indicators (productivity, investment, expenditure and effort on research and development, patent applications, etc.) will be analyzed, contrasting the objectives pursued and the results observed.This evaluation will also face difficulties, such as the choice of the appropriate measurement of the effects of the policies, the measurement of the cost-benefits of the programme analysed and the causal attribution of the impact of the policy. Despite this, the evaluation of an innovation policy must not lose sight of the complexity and multi-causality of the relationships produced, which can provoke a certain indetermination in the effects of the policy analysed.By the way, the truth is that the current challenges that the capitalist system is facing are creating a growing awareness in relation to the direction of innovation policies and the effects they cause in society (Pereira & Vence, 2016). Given the current trends, there is no doubt that much of the attractiveness of companies will be marked in the future by their respect for the environment. Along these lines, previous studies such as those by Chen, Lai & Wen (2006) and Palmer & Truong (2017) show the relationship between environmental innovations and business competitiveness and profits.In the European context, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) expressly states that the environment is an area which constitutes a shared competence between the EU and the Member States (TFEU, art. 4, 2012). At the same time, the obligation to integrate environmental protection requirements into the definition and implementation of EU policies and activities is maintained (TFEU, art. 11, now art. 6 TEC, 2004). The Structural Funds have been the instrument designed by the EU to support regional development, as well as Research, Development and Innovation, also in the environmental field. In this sense, in the 2007-2013 programming period, the ERDF has promoted actions in this field in Spain through Technology Fund (object of study) and the Operational Programme for the Knowledge-Based Economy. For this reason, we have chosen to analize the most important programme supporting business Research, Development and Innovation belonging to the Technology Fund, the ERDFInnterconecta programme.It is generally agreed that access to public funds-such as the Structural Funds-has been shown to be an effective measure to boost companies & PRIME; capacity to generate ecoinnovations, especially if there is ample provision of external and internal resources (Cecere, Corrocher & Mancusi, 2018). In fact, business access to financial resources supporting innovation in environmental technology has also demonstrated improvements in emission reductions and business results (Klemetsen, Rosendhal.& Jakobsen, 2016) and productivity (Jaraite & De Maria; 2016). In any case, recent studies (Wielgorka & Szczepaniak, 2019) have precisely pointed to the lack of financing and access to credit, and the high implementation costs, as the main difficulties faced by SMEs in achieving eco-innovations. Empirical results suggest that public funds for eco-innovation are generally perceived by these agents as complementary to other external sources of funding (Costa, Garcia-Quevedo & Segarra, 2014) tough, in any case, the effects induced by an environmental innovation policy will depend on the nature of the instruments used (Ghisetti & Pontoni, 2015) and on specificities such as cooperation with external partners (i.e. suppliers, universities and companies providing knowledge-intensive services) that will make it possible to replace part of the effects produced by internal R & D efforts (De Marchi, 2012).This research has a remarkable empirical nature, since it has been necessary to gather and process quantitative and qualitative data from numerous sources to conduct the study. Regarding the implementation of the Operational Programme itself, information was available from the Ministry of Finance; for the R & D data, it was necessary to resort to the statistical bodies at regional level-the Galician Institute of Statistics [IGE]-, at national level-the Spanish Institute of Statistics [INE]-, and at European level-Eurostat and the European Patent Office-; for specific information on the operation and implementation of the programmes in Galicia, information was available from the Department of Finances of the Xunta de Galicia; the data of the companies participating in the ERDF-Innterconecta calls for proposals in Galicia have been analysed thanks to information from the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI); finally, specific information has been constructed for this research and the unexploited information obtained from the ARDAN database has also been used.The conclusions of the study show that the programme's impact varies according to the type of project and the type of companies receiving public funding through the Innterconecta programme belonging to the Technology Fund. The conclusions drawn also allow formulate recommendations for design and implementation for other Research, Development and Innovation policies in the territory that foster greater prominence of environmental technology change for innovative companies.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

WELFARE EFFECTS OF PATENT PROTECTION IN A SEMI-ENDOGENOUS GROWTH MODEL,R&D; Patent Protection; Welfare Analysis; Semi-Endogenous Growth; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; BLOCKING PATENTS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INNOVATION; POLICY; NORTH,"This paper examines how strengthening patent protection affects welfare in a nonscale quality-ladder model, which was developed by Segerstrom [American Economic Review 88, 1290-1310] and generalized by Li [American Economic Review 93, 1009-1017]. In the Segerstrom-Li model, patent protection creates no distortion in static allocation among the production sectors. In order to examine the welfare effects of strengthening patent protection adequately, we incorporate a competitive outside good into the Segerstrom-Li model. In the general model, we derive the welfare-maximizing degree of patent protection analytically by utilizing a linear approximation of the transition path. The result shows that the welfare-maximizing degree of patent protection is weaker when the market share of the outside good is positive than when it is zero. In other words, disregarding the static distortion that patent protection creates leads to excessive patent protection.",2020,Business & Economics,0
When stronger patent law reduces patenting: Empirical evidence,CAFC; entry; patent law; patent strategy; strategic patents; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INNOVATION; IMPACT; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIES; THICKETS; COURTS; ENTRY; FIRMS,"Research Summary Theoretically, stronger legal protection affects strategic portfolios in two ways. As each patent becomes more effective, the gain from multiple patents would be less, reducing the demand for patents (negative inframarginal effect). With the effective price of patent protection being lower, the demand for protection and patents would increase (positive marginal effect). The net effect is more likely to be negative in complex technology industries, and magnified by patent ownership fragmentation, manufacturing assets, technological competition, and size. Exploiting variation in the shift in patent law due to the Federal Circuit Appeals Court (CAFC), we find that the average increase in patent protection due to the CAFC led businesses to reduce strategic patenting by 23.3%, and the contingent effects accorded with the hypotheses. Managerial Summary How should businesses adjust patent portfolios to changes in the legal protection of patents? As each patent becomes more effective, the gain from multiple patents would be less, reducing the demand for patents. With the effective price of patent protection being lower, the demand for protection and patents would increase. The net effect is more likely to be negative where the stakes (costs of holdup or gain from exclusivity) are larger. Empirical evidence from strategic patenting by U.S. manufacturing businesses between 1986 and 1992 before and after changes in patent law due to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit supports our propositions.",2023,Business & Economics,0

Utilizing a sample comprising 43 advanced and emerging economies, we identify the effect of patent protection on product-quality by exploiting the variation in patent protection enforcement across countries and the variation in R&D-intensity across industries (as a measure of an industry's dependence on patent protection enforcement). We find that R&D-intensive industries exhibit a disproportionate increase in the production and export of higher-quality products in countries with more effective patent protection relative to those industries in countries with lower levels of patent protection. We also find that the disproportionate exported product quality increase in R&D-intensive industries due to patent protection enforcement is stronger for differentiated products and in developed countries or countries with higher technological capacity. Overall, our paper provides new insights into the real effects of patent protection on the economy, with the most obvious being that it underscores the interplay between country heterogeneity in patent protection and industry heterogeneity in R&D-intensity as an essential determinant of the geographical and industry variation in average product-quality. Nonetheless, it re-emphasizes the need for patent policies to take into account country-specific idiosyncrasies in their design.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Evolving intellectual property protection for new corn varieties in the United States: An empirical analysis,corn; patent; plant variety protection; ,"The US affirmed patent protection for genetically modified plant traits in 1985, asserting that firms could patent new hybrid plant varieties when formerly plant variety protection was the primary means to protect hybrid varieties. This paper examines how firms' intellectual property choices have changed for new corn varieties created during the years 1985-2012. The data suggests that firms increasingly rely on patent protection as their only form of intellectual property protection for new varieties. For varieties with patent protection, low-valued varieties, as determined by low patent renewal rates, receive less net benefit from obtaining plant variety protection compared to high-valued varieties.",2024,Government & Law,0
Measuring cross-country heterogeneity in the value of patents based on the patent-trade relationship,Export-patent relationship; foreign patenting; strategic patenting; value of patents; PROTECTION; RIGHTS,"Because of the heterogeneity of the patent protection system and the business environment across countries, the private value of patents varies. Therefore, current approaches that mostly consider the level of patent protection have limitations in capturing the strategic value of patents. This paper suggests a new approach for estimating the perceived private value of a patent in a country by considering the scale of trade in the United States, Europe, China, Japan, Korea, Brazil, India, Canada, and Russia. The results indicate that the value of patents in a country changed over the sample period, regardless of the level of patent protection, suggesting that changes in the strategic business value of patents played a key role in the value of patents in those countries.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Effects of patent policy on growth and inequality: exogenous versus endogenous quality improvements,Innovation; Patent protection; Economic growth; Inequality; D30; O30; O40; STRATEGIC STABILITY,"This study explores the implications of patent protection on growth and inequality under exogenous versus endogenous quality improvements. Our analysis shows that the effects of strengthening patent protection under an endogenous innovation size can be quite different from those under an exogenous innovation size. Under our calibrated parameter values, we find that strengthening patent protection promotes economic growth, raises income inequality, and decreases consumption inequality under exogenous quality improvements. However, in the case of endogenous quality improvements, strengthening patent protection generates an inverted-U effect on economic growth; both income inequality and consumption inequality decrease with the strength of patent protection.",2024,Business & Economics,0

We find that whether stronger patent protection stimulates or stifles innovation depends on credit constraints faced by R&D entrepreneurs. When credit constraints are nonbinding (binding), strengthening patent protection stimulates (stifles) R&D. The overall effect of patent protection on innovation follows an inverted-U pattern. By relaxing the credit constraints, financial development stimulates innovation. Furthermore, patent protection is more likely to have a positive effect on innovation under a higher level of financial development. We consider cross-country panel regressions and find supportive evidence for this result.",2020,Business & Economics,0

We consider two dimensions of patent policy: backward protection against imitation and forward protection, also known as blocking patents, against subsequent innovation that builds on a patented technology. Incumbent patent holders endogenously invest resources to protect their monopoly rents by impeding market entry of innovative competitors. We show that patent policy impacts economic growth through its influence on both the ex ante R&D incentives of potential innovators and the post-innovation rent protection incentives of incumbent firms. Most importantly, our analysis formalizes a novel growth-promoting role of forward protection; by guaranteeing previous innovators a share of future innovators' profits, forward protection reduces the incentive to actively obstruct follow-on innovations. We identify conditions under which the selective use of forward protection can stimulate economic growth through this mechanism.",2024,Business & Economics,0

The level of patent protection chosen by the incumbent affects the likelihood that a potential entrant will be found guilty of patent infringement. This mechanism can operate as a punishment device that eases the conditions for collusion sustainability. Therefore, in a sense, patent protection can be regarded as an instrument allowing replication of the monopoly outcome in the context of a contestable market.",2020,Business & Economics,0
PATENTS AND GROWTH IN OLG ECONOMY WITH PHYSICAL CAPITAL,Patents; Physical Capital; Growth; OLG; ,"We study the implications of patents in an overlapping generations model with horizontal innovation of differentiated physical capital. We show that within this demographic structure of finitely lived agents, weakening patent protection generates two contradicting effects on innovation and growth. Weakening patent protection lowers the (average) price of patented machines, thereby increasing machine utilization, output, aggregate saving, and investment. However, a higher demand for machines shifts investment away from the R&D activity aimed at inventing new machine varieties toward the formation of physical capital. The growth-maximizing level of patent protection is incomplete. Shortening patent length is more effective than loosening patent breadth in spurring growth, due to an additional positive effect on growth, that is decreasing investment in old patents. Welfare can be improved by weakening patent protection beyond the growth-maximizing level.",2021,Business & Economics,0

Existing literature mainly analyzes the patent-inequality relationship in a growth-theoretic framework with a sole growth engine. This study explores the effect of patent policy on income inequality in a variety-expansion model, in which R & D and capital accumulation are non-complementary engines of growth. We find that patent protection affects income inequality only through the interest-rate channel, which depends on the magnitude of R & D productivity relative to capital productivity. If R & D productivity relative to capital is high (low), stronger patent protection intensifies (mitigates) income inequality. Moreover, we calibrate the model to the US economy, and the numerical results support the implications of patent protection on economic growth and income inequality. This result is consistent with our empirical findings using cross-country panel data on OECD countries.",2023,Business & Economics,0

We consider a cost-reducing innovation by either an incumbent or a (potential) entrant. According to our analysis, when patent protection is high enough, the entrant is willing to pay more compared with the incumbent, it licenses the innovation exclusively, and it acts as a non-practicing entity. In the case of low patent protection, the threat of imitation discourages licensing agreements, and consequently, the incumbent ends up investing more. Thus, the level of patent protection impacts the structure of the market, affecting R&D appropriability and social welfare.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Patent protection: does it promote or inhibit the patented technological knowledge diffusion?,Technological knowledge diffusion; Patent protection; Patent lifetime; Patent claim; INNOVATION; CITATION; INFORMATION; FLOWS; LIFE,"Patents not only promote the dissemination of technological knowledge through the disclosure of innovative information, but restrict the use of patented technology by the public within the scope of the law. With this exclusive protection on the premise of information disclosure, it is ambiguous whether patents help or hinder the diffusion of knowledge within the span of patents. This study first constructs a multidimensional index of patented technological knowledge diffusion (PTKD) from spatiotemporal aspects, and compares the differences in technological knowledge diffusion of four types of patents-valid patent (VP), zero-cited patent before expiration (Z-B), zero-cited patent after expiration (Z-A), and non-zero-cited patent before and after expiration (NZ-BA). Then, the impact of patent protection-patent lifetime (PL), the number of independent claims (NIC), the number of words in the first independent claim (NWF)-on the degree of PTKD is explored. The results demonstrate that NZ-BA has the highest level of PTKD in terms of growth rate, technological and geographical breadth and depth, followed by VP. Meanwhile, PL affects the diffusion growth rate and technological and geographical breadth negatively, NIC positively affects the diffusion average speed and technological and geographical depth while NWF only positively affects the technological depth of diffusion. These findings highlight the role of different types of patents in promoting technological innovation and promote a better understanding of the correlation between patent protection and PTKD, which provides support for decision-makers to protect property protection and guides the patentees to protect their long-term economic and technological benefits.",2022,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,0
"Secrecy, the patent puzzle and endogenous growth",Innovation; Intellectual property rights; Endogenous growth; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PROTECTION; INNOVATION,"Endogenous growth models typically assume that innovations are protected solely by patents. Consequently, they predict that strengthening patent protection stimulates innovation by increasing the private return to R&D. This contrasts with empirical evidence that: (1) firms routinely employ a combination of patents and secrecy and (2) stronger patent regimes have been associated with increased patenting but not increased innovation, a finding referred to as the patent puzzle. In this paper, I develop a novel model of endogenous growth that is consistent with this evidence. Successful innovators' choose an appropriation strategy in the form of a patent, secrecy mix. Both protection methods are imperfect, and innovators face a trade-off between secrecy's superior protection against imitation and patenting's protection against rival innovation. I demonstrate that growth oriented policy changes generate important economic effects through their impact on the endogenous appropriation strategies of innovators. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the relationship between export quality upgrading and patent protection is dependent on the technological stage of an economy. Specifically, patent protection promotes quality growth if an economy's product quality is sufficiently close to the world frontier level. We characterize the density of the distribution of country products, determining the share of country-product combinations that fall under or pass a threshold, and draw some implications for patent policy design. While a majority of combinations exceed the critical threshold, the results nevertheless call for differentiation in the strength of patent protection by income group and product class. To establish these findings, we employ a very extensive index of export product quality at the four-digit SITC level and utilize a country-level measure of effective patent protection for the period 1990-2010.",2021,Development Studies; Business & Economics,0

Spanning 134 countries from 1990 to 2020, the IPPS index encompasses four dimensions-international mechanism, legislation, enforcement, and administration-constructed using standardized techniques recommended by the OECD. Results indicate global growth in patent protection strength until 2005, followed by a plateau with persistent disparities. Our findings also highlight the heterogeneity across countries and dimensions. In particular, variations in four dimensions are observed among countries at different income levels, with enforcement and administration being more pronounced, often due to resource constraints and a lack of willingness. Linear regression analysis demonstrates a positive and statistically significant relationship between the IPPS index and the Global Innovation Index (GII), affirming the correlation between patent protection strength and innovation. Sensitivity tests validate the robustness of country rankings across different weighting and aggregation methods. These results align with the viewpoint of some commentators who argue that a peaceful North-South dialogue requires introducing a development agenda that allows for affordable access, rather than solely extending intellectual property rights. The IPPS index serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, patent managers, and practitioners, enabling the identification of strengths and weaknesses in patent protection systems and informing targeted policy measures and strategic decision-making.",2024,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0

Environmental protection tax and enterprises' green technology innovation: Evidence from China,Environmental protection tax; Green innovation; Patent quantity; Patent quality; ,"The Environmental Protection Tax Law was officially implemented, marking the initial establishment of China's green tax system. This paper aims to estimate whether the introduction of environmental protection tax will promote enterprises' green technology innovation.

The results show that, after the implementation of environmental protection tax, the quantity of green patents increased significantly, while the quality of green patents decreased significantly. The analysis of mechanism channel reveals that environmental protection tax policy appears to increase the number of green patents putting regulatory pressure on enterprises and increasing R&D investment, while managerial myopia inhibits the improvement of green patent quality. The changes in the quantity and quality of green patents in large enterprises are more significant.

Unlike previous studies, both the licensing fee and the number of licensees are endogenously determined by the innovator's maximization and the free-entry condition. Using this model, we show that strong patent protection does not always enhance innovation, economic growth, and welfare. Furthermore, the extended analysis provides the policy implication that the effect of patent policy depends on how difficult further innovation is without patent licensing of the current leading technology.",2020,Business & Economics,0

It shows that the comparison between the productivity of R&D and that of capital plays an important role in the welfare analysis. When the relative productivity of R&D compared to capital is high (low), social welfare takes an inverted-U shape for (is decreasing in) the strength of patent protection, and the welfare-maximizing degree of patent protection is no greater than (identical to) the growth-maximizing degree. Moreover, the model is calibrated to the US economy and the numerical results support these welfare implications.",2021,Business & Economics,0
The Scope of Software Patent Protection in the Digital Age: Evidence from Alice,software innovations; software patents; patent scope; open-source software; intellectual property; public policy; Alice v CLS Bank; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; FIRMS; APPROPRIABILITY; COLLABORATION; SURVIVAL; INDUSTRY; IMPACT; LAW,"Software is the foundation of the digital economy. The scope of software patent protection and the social and private value of software patenting are hence central to recent policy debates. The landmark 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Alice Corp v. CLS Bank had a profound impact on software patenting, drastically narrowing the scope of patent protection on software innovation. We theorize and provide empirical evidence that a narrower scope of software patent protection is associated with a greater degree of open source activities and improved sales in software firms. We also evaluate how individual firm's ex ante software patent stock may moderate the proposed relationships. These findings offer insights into the roles of patent scope for software innovation in the digital economy and have important implications for the software patent and digital innovation literatures. They also have compelling implications for patent policies on software and software-related inventions, such as artificial intelligence, blockchains, cloud computing, and other emerging digital innovations.",2024,Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics,0

Using data on patent applications filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office between 2001 and 2012 and examiner leniency as a source of exogenous variation in patent protection, we find that one additional patent granted decreases the likelihood of changing employers, on average, by 23%. This decrease is stronger when the employee has fewer coinventors, works outside the core of the firm, and produces more basic-research innovations. These findings are consistent with the idea that patents turn innovation-related skills into patent-holder-specific human capital.",2020,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,0
PROVING PRIORITY: ASSIGNING EMPLOYEE INVENTIONS IN A GLOBAL MARKET,; PATENT; PROPERTY,"Patent rights are territorial. A patent granted in the United States is only enforceable in the United States. Yet increasingly so, a successful launch of new technology or a product requires global strategy, and global strategy requires global patent protection. Seeking patent protection in multiple countries is routine for many companies. And while these multi-national teams of patent counsel and global administrative support are skilled at navigating different patentability requirements and processes, they are currently experiencing a new challenge: defending the priority date of their original patent application when seeking transnational patent protection. Companies are facing this challenge because of differences in patent assignment laws around the world. Patent assignment laws play a crucial role in patent protection, with the majority of patentable inventions around the world created by employees and assigned to employers. This Article demonstrates the interconnection of patent priority around the world by showing how the application of different rules regarding patent assignment law and patent priority currently lead to higher transaction costs and wasteful, if not abusive, litigation. This Article proposes two possible solutions to the global problem of proving patent priority: build a centralized recordation database modeled after the already-existing secured transactions recordation systems in place in almost every country worldwide, or, alternatively, include a disclosure requirement in the already-existing transnational patenting processes.",2020,Government & Law,0
When does patent protection spur cumulative research within firms?,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS; KNOWLEDGE; FLOW,"We estimate the effect of patent protection on follow-on investments in corporate scientific research. We exploit a new method for identifying an exogenous reduction in the protection a granted patent provides. Using data on public, research-active firms between 1990 and 2015, we find that firms respond to a decrease in patent protection by reducing follow-on research, as measured by a drop in internal citations to an associated scientific article. We study this effect across firms with varying commercialization capabilities and across varying thickness levels of markets for technology. We find that the effect is stronger in technologies where patents are traded less frequently. Our findings are consistent with a stylized model whereby patent protection is a strategic substitute for commercialization capability. Our results imply that stronger patents encourage follow-on research, but also shift the locus of research from big firms toward smaller firms and startups (JEL D22, O31, O32, O34).",2023,Business & Economics; Government & Law,0
PHARMACEUTICAL PATENT PROTECTION IN THE CHINA-US PHASE ONE TRADE AGREEMENT: CHINA'S PERSPECTIVE,; LINKAGE,"Medicines are key to preserving human health, ensuring the sanctity of life and safeguarding human dignity. The China -US Phase One Trade Agreement puts particular emphasis on the protection of pharmaceutical patents. However, it lacks appropriate limitations on the high standard of protection given to such patents. This could compel China to adopt similar rules in future international negotiations, thus impeding the development of the country's pharmaceutical industry. To promote access to medicines and foster the growth of its domestic pharmaceutical industry, China should adopt an equitable principle of pharmaceutical patent protection that aligns with international norms and that also considers China's specific circumstances. This approach would prevent high international standards of pharmaceutical patent protection from being imposed on China and promote more equitable competition between pharmaceutical companies producing original and generic drugs. In future international discussions pertaining to patent regulation, China should endeavor to establish appropriate limitations on patent protection that strike a balance between the interests of pharmaceutical companies and facilitate the transformation of China's pharmaceutical industry from producing generic drugs to developing original drugs.",2024,Government & Law,0
Tariff barriers and the protection of intellectual property in the global economy,International patent protection; Import tariffs; National treatment; R&D; Welfare; NATIONAL TREATMENT; PATENT EXAMINATION; PASS-THROUGH; TRADE,"This paper develops a simple two-country model of quality-improving innovation to study the role tariff barriers play in shaping the welfare impact of global patent protection. We show that international patent policy coordination via national treatment is desirable only if tariff barriers between countries are sufficiently low. Furthermore, if countries are free to impose their optimal tariffs on one another, requiring national treatment in patent protection unambiguously lowers world welfare. Hence, constraining tariffs helps pave the way for international coordination over patent protection. This insight provides a potential rationale for the historical sequencing of policy reforms observed in the global trading system: multilateral rules on intellectual property were adopted only after decades of trade negotiations had succeeded in substantially reducing global tariffs.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Patent data access control and protection using blockchain technology,; DATA-SECURITY; PRIVACY PRESERVATION; ABE,"The purposes are to develop the patent data profoundly, control the data access process effectively, and protect the patent information and content. The traditional patent review systems are analyzed. For the present patent data security and privacy protection technologies and algorithms, the patent information data are stored on different block nodes after data fragmentation using blockchain technology. Then the data are shared using the data encryption algorism. In this way, data access control can be restricted to particular users. Finally, a patent data protection scheme based on privacy protection is proposed. The security of the scheme and the model performance are verified through simulation experiments. The time required to encrypt 10 MB files with 64-bit and 128-bit data is 35 ms and 105 ms, respectively. The proposed re-encryption algorithm only needs 1 s to decrypt 64 KB data, and only 1% of the data needs asymmetric encryption. This greatly reduces the computational overhead of encryption. Results demonstrate that the system can effectively control the access methods of users, efficiently protect the personal privacy and patent content of patent applicants, and reduce the patent office cloud computing overhead using the local resources of branches. The distributed storage methods can reduce the cloud system interaction of the patent office, thereby greatly improving the speed of encryption and ensuring data security. Compared with the state of the art methods, the proposed patent data access and protection system based on blockchain technology have greater advantages in data security and model performance. The research results can provide a research foundation and practical value for the protection and review systems of patent data.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
A patent registration and trading system based on blockchain,Blockchain technology; Patent registration; Patent trading; Patent protection; Traceability; Smart contract; TRACEABILITY; COPYRIGHT,"The traditional process of patent registration and trading is very complex, often hindered by challenges related to information security and patent traceability. As a popular emergent technology, blockchain has several useful characteristics such as tamper proof, distributed data management, timestamp, asymmetric encryption, and smart contract. Built upon these characteristics, this paper develops a patent registration and trading system for improved information security, immutability, transparency, and traceability. This system includes functions of patent registration and storage, patent trading, user privacy protection during patent registration and trading process, and overall data access control. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, this paper builds a blockchain environment to simulate a patent registration and trading process. We further conduct a security analysis and an efficiency analysis to compare the proposed patent registration and trading process with the traditional process. Through these comparisons we show that the proposed blockchain-aided patent registration and trading system is effective in resolving several key patent protection challenges. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed to highlight the significance of our proposed method.",2022,Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,0
The Fourth Amendment of Chinese Patent Law and Discussion on its Practical Effects,; ,"Through comparative study, case and data analysis, this article summarizes the key points of the fourth amendment of Chinese Patent Law, and analyses the expected practical significance. Meanwhile, this article also discusses the shortcomings of the new patent law after the fourth amendment, and puts forward some suggestions for further improvement and refinement. The purpose of the fourth amendment of Chinese Patent Law is mainly to make the Chinese patent system more in line with the current technological and economic development in China as well as international cooperative innovation. The core points of the fourth amendment include: (1) strengthening patent enforcement by adopting punitive damages to intentional patent infringement, and increasing the patent protection duration extension for new pharmaceuticals, etc. (2) Promoting patent implementation by adding 'Open Licence' rules and improving employees' invention regulations; (3) Improving design patent protection by expending protection duration and adopting protection for partial designs. (4) Increasing the provisions about the grace period for patent filings of inventions related to public interests. The new Patent Law 2020 will gradually show its significant practical effects. At the same time, however, there are still some regulations that need to be further clarified and refined for ensuring better implementation of the new law.",2023,Area Studies,0

Patent protection in developing countries and global welfare: WTO obligations versus flexibilities,Patent protection; Compulsory licensing; Exhaustion policies; Imitation; TRIPS; Quality; Welfare; WTO; PARALLEL IMPORTS; EXHAUSTION; INNOVATION; ACCESS; TRADE,"This paper develops a North-South model to evaluate the South's incentive for patent protection when a Northern firm's investment in quality-enhancing research and development (R&D) is affected by its patent policy. The model is used to (a) evaluate the impact of requiring the South to fulfill its key WTO obligation of instituting patent protection and (b) to address the role of two major flexibilities that wro members enjoy with respect to their patent policies: the freedom to implement exhaustion policies of their choosing and the right to use compulsory licensing (CL) subject to certain stipulations. Two forces drive the model: how much the firm invests in R&D and whether or not selling in the South maximizes its global profit. CL improves consumer access in the South and can even raise innovation and global welfare. Provided the South implements patent protection, innovation and welfare are higher if the North follows national as opposed to international exhaustion. However, the South's incentive for patent protection is not necessarily stronger under national exhaustion. Not only is CL more likely to be used under international exhaustion, the welfare gain resulting from its application is also higher relative to that under national exhaustion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Patent protection is less effective in limiting the leakage of nonpatented knowledge through interfirm mobility of employees, and a gradual strengthening of patent protection worldwide diminishes its effect as countries get closer to the intellectual property rights (IPR) frontier. We provide evidence in an empirical analysis of 3393 multinational firms' R&D location choices for 8015 greenfield R&D investments in 105 (potential) host countries, during 2003-2014. The relationship between R&D investment location choices and IPR protection is subject to declining marginal effects and negatively moderated by inventor mobility.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Should Pharma Companies Waive Their COVID-19 Vaccine Patents? A Legal and Ethical Appraisal,COVID-19 vaccine; patent waiver; Jewish ethics; duty theory; ,"Pharmaceutical companies, like many other types of companies, are incentivized to create, manufacture, and distribute new products, in part due to the legal protections of patent law. However, the tension between patent rights and the public good has been heightened as pharma companies developed new vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Wealthy governments paid well for vaccines and received ample supplies, while low- and middle-income countries struggled to obtain access to any vaccines. Some countries called for pharmaceutical companies to waive their patent protections for vaccines in order to facilitate the worldwide manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This paper will examine the rationale of patent protection and patent waiver issues, then compare these concepts with ethical constructs and a Jewish perspective.",2023,Government & Law,0
The impact of patent protection on technological innovation: A global value chain division of labor perspective,Global value chain; Patent protection; Technological innovation; Threshold effect; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; TRADE,"Technological innovation is the core competitiveness of a country's comprehensive national power, and patent protection is the institutional guarantee to stimulate enterprises' technological innovation. Considering the technology spillover effect brought by a country's participation in global value chains (GVCs), this study places the patent system in the context of international production segmentation, and utilizes the industry panel data of China's manufacturing industries from 2000 to 2014 and 2007-2021 respectively, constructs the two-way fixed effects model, the interaction term model, and the panel threshold model in turn, to demonstrate the stage impact of the patent system when China's manufacturing industries are in different positions in GVCs. It is found that: strengthening patent protection can significantly improve the level of technological innovation in China's manufacturing industries, especially for high-tech industries; the innovation incentive effect of patent protection is increasing as the manufacturing industry climbs to the high-end of GVC; when the GVC status of the manufacturing industry crosses the threshold, the positive promotion effect of patent protection on the level of technological innovation will be substantially increased. The findings of the article show that institutional policies to incentivize technological innovation should be closely aligned with national needs and be responsive to social progress.",2024,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0
Research on the Patent System in the Field of Water Resources,Water resources; water-related patents; scarcity; industrialization; ,"The paper analyzes the patent system in the field of water resources to boost the industrialization of water-related patents. Water-related patents are characterized by scarcity and high intelligence, which has become a crucial technology field in fierce competition among the United States, Japan, Europe, South Korea and other countries. Analyzing the International Patent Classification Table, we find that the standards of patent laws guarantee the practicality, novelty and creativity of the water-related patents. Our results show that the application of water-related patents in agriculture, industry and drinking water is growing rapidly, and strengthening of patent protection may further promotes the industrial application. We point out that it is necessary to strengthen the legislation on the research and investment of the water-related patents. Improvement of the patent examination quality, along with perfect enforcement of patent protection, may facilitate the innovation of water-related patents.",2020,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology,0
Unilateral Acquisition and the Requirements of Freedom: A Kantian Account of the Judicial Exceptions to Patent Protection,; ,"For obscure reasons, courts exclude some statutorily patentable inventions ('judicial exceptions') from patent protection. These exclusions have been criticized for impeding innovation, contrary to the purpose of patent law. I argue that freedom requires these exclusions even if they impede innovation. Patents, like property, can be unilaterally acquired, limiting others' freedom without their consent. Kant explains why, to reconcile property with equal freedom, only rivalrous objects in acquirers' first possession can be unilaterally acquired. States can rightfully authorize unilateral acquisition of only these objects. Drawing from Kant, I explain how patent protection conflicts with equal freedom unless patented inventions involve inventive uses of rivalrous objects external to human bodies. Enabled by inventive concepts, these uses would be impossible without these concepts, and are thus in the first possession of their inventors. I then show how the most recent United States Supreme Court judicial exception decisions limit patent protection to inventive uses of rivalrous external objects.",2022,Government & Law,0

We first build a unique dataset uniting detailed firm balance sheet information with firm patent data for the period 1998-2007. We find strong evidence that both within-firm increases in patent stock and initial patenting event are associated with increases in total factor productivity. Patent subsidy programs sequentially implemented across Chinese provinces weaken this positive association over time. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have higher productivity-patenting elasticities than private firms, especially after the SOE reforms.

Communities as inventors: Rethinking positive protection of traditional knowledge through patents,international economic law; moral rights; patents; traditional knowledge; TRIPS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; RIGHTS,"Traditional knowledge of indigenous communities often overlaps with spiritual traditions in which certain biogenetic resources are understood to be sacred. Accordingly, one of the key concerns of these communities is to retain control over the manner in which the knowledge is used so as to ensure that its sanctity is preserved. While much of the literature on the protection of traditional knowledge revolves around defensive protection, some commentators have argued for positive protection using patent law by recognizing the entire community as inventors and vesting property rights in perpetuity with the community as a whole. This paper observes that such positive protection through patents is consistent with the TRIPS Agreement and is likely to be successful in combating biopiracy but suffers from one crucial flaw-even if the community owns patent rights over a biogenetic resource, the community has no means to ensure that a potential licensee of the patent would adhere to the religious protocols of the community. Accordingly, it argues for the incorporation of collective moral rights rooted in indigenous law into the legal framework governing the licensing of traditional knowledge patent with a view to ensuring that indigenous communities can preserve their cultural heritage even after such community patents are licensed.",2023,Government & Law,0

Leaving aside the practical implications of this judgment in terms of the possibility of obtaining a supplementary protection certificate for a product protected by a patent for a second or further medical application (application patent), it is worth considering the reasoning the Court relies on to arrive at the thesis it formulates. While the Court's response and the resulting impact will be treated differently depending on whether the actual extension of patent protection in the pharmaceutical industry is assessed as appropriate and desirable or whether the justification for said protection is questioned, the manner in which the provisions of Regulation 469/2009 are proposed to be interpreted raises doubts as to whether the final outcome of the interpretation is correct.",2021,Government & Law,0
UNREGISTERED PATENTS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; EX ANTE; COPYRIGHT; INFORMATION; MARKET; POST; ANTICOMMONS; INNOVATION; SCIENCE,"Although all should be treated equally under the law, patent law has long been known to favor some less than others. Patentable technology is highly heterogeneous, covering everything from minute improvements in electronics to pioneering new artificial organs, but patent protection itself is purely a one-size-fits-all system. Patents thus overreward some while underrewarding others. On the one hand, patents overreward low-investment, low-value inventions by granting them the same twenty-year term of protection as those that required much higher investments and yield much higher social value. The resulting glut of low-quality patents has contributed greatly to the patent crisis of opportunistic patent trolls, heightened transaction costs, and costly litigation that have ultimately stalled innovation. On the other hand, patents also underreward in two significant ways. First, patents often fail to give some high-investment, high-value inventions enough protection. Second, many inventors are shut out from patent protection altogether if they lack the resources necessary to navigate the patent system's costly, complex, and frequently biased examination process. This latter phenomenon disproportionately affects female and minority inventors, among others, thereby creating significant distributive effects. This Article argues that both of these effects-the overprotection of low-value inventions and the underprotection of inventions by women and minorities-could be alleviated by altering one particular but seldom-appreciated aspect of the patent system's one-size-fits-all approach: its registration-only design. Copyright and trademark law allow for both registered and unregistered rights, but the patent system grants rights only to those who register their inventions and undergo subsequent examination. If the patent system were to follow the two-tiered approach of copyright and trademark law, however, and implement a regime of automatic but very limited unregistered rights in addition to registered rights, it could help address both problems. First, providing a much lower-cost alternative for obtaining protection, such a two-tiered regime could, with varying degrees of aggressiveness, channel low-investment, low-value inventions away from the system-clogging overprotections of the full, twenty-year, broad rights currently granted to registered patents. Second, as the authors of this Article have previously argued, by providing automatic rights without having to go through the resource-intensive registration and examination process, unregistered patent protection could help women and other disadvantaged inventors gain greater access to patent protections. Maintaining a two-tiered regime of both registered and unregistered patent rights thus offers a promising way to mitigate the inefficiencies of the current system by attenuating certain aspects of the current patent crisis while promoting a more egalitarian playing field for inventors.",2020,Government & Law,0

The government allocates tax revenue between new investment and maintenance expenditure for public capital. We consider how the balanced-growth-maximizing public investment policy changes as patent protection becomes stronger, as has been done in many countries. The results show that as patent protection becomes stronger, the income tax rate to finance public investment should be lower and the expenditure share of new investment should be higher. The balanced-growth-maximizing public investment policy leads to a smaller government as patent protection becomes stronger. This paper also shows that the balanced-growth-maximizing public investment policy is equivalent to the welfare-maximizing public investment policy along the balanced growth path. We also characterize both the growth-maximizing and welfare-maximizing combination of public investment policy and patent policy along the balanced growth path.",2021,Business & Economics,0

Can patentee preference in patent infringement dispute resolution impact innovation?,; PROTECTION; SYSTEMS,"Evaluating the impact of intellectual property protection on innovation should include multiple perspectives, of which the impact of patent infringement remedies is an indispensable perspective. The two options for resolving patent infringement disputes in China include civil litigation (CL) and administrative adjudication (AA). Despite the fact that the judicial system has been emphasized as playing the leading role in intellectual property protection, patentees have shown a strong preference for AA since 2015. The general application of AA had been criticized by scholars. Does the patentee's preference bring inappropriate protection and stifled innovation? This study used regression models and 2008-2020 data on the choice of patent dispute resolution mode in China. The number of invention patent applications was the dependent variable, and choices for CL or AA were the independent variables. The choice of AA and the invention patent application were found to have a significant and positive association, implying that AA provides an appropriate level of intellectual property protection to incentivize innovation. Characteristics derived from AA should be valued and used as a reference to improve innovation policies.",2024,Business & Economics,0

Recent years have brought numerous debates on limiting the possibility of patent protection for biotechnology inventions for ethical reasons. The existing literature examines bioethical justification in terms of the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice. The primary purpose of this study is to explore the uncertainty of ethics guidelines provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and section 3(b) of the Indian Patents Act 1970 and the applicability of the bioethics principles.",2023,Religion,0
Optimal mix of R&D subsidy and patent protection in a heterogeneous-industry R&D-based growth model,Endogenous growth; Heterogeneous-industry model; Patent protection; R&D subsidies; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; POLICY; WELFARE,"This paper constructs an R&D-based endogenous growth model with heterogeneous industries in which the parameters, including the contribution of R&D to productivity, differ by industry. Using this model to examine the optimal mix of R&D subsidies and patent protection, we obtain the following results. First, R&D subsidies should be set higher (lower) in industries with a higher (lower) contribution of R&D to productivity, whereas patent breadth should be set such that markups are uniform across all industries. Second, we derive the optimal mix in the situation where R&D subsidies and patent protection are uniform across industries and numerically show that the uniform constraint on R&D subsidies involves significant growth and welfare losses and that greater heterogeneity across industries significantly magnifies them.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Why are they hiding? Patent secrecy and patenting strategies,Patent strategy; pre-grant publication; patent secrecy; INVENTORS PROTECTION ACT; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; MARKET; KNOWLEDGE; ACQUISITION; OPPOSITION; DISCLOSURE; FRAMEWORK,"Patents provide a mechanism to protect inventors from having their inventions imitated by competitors in exchange for a detailed disclosure of the patented invention. However, the disclosure requirement might enable any interested and skilled audiences to understand and replicate the knowledge conveyed by the patent document. The enactment of the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA) on 29 November 2000 required US patent applicants to have their patent application published 18 months after the filing date. The AIPA allows patentees to choose the option of keeping their application secret, relinquishing foreign patent protection. This paper investigates what variables are associated with the decisions made by large companies to keep a patent secret until its granting, using a sample of granted patents applied for by publicly traded companies between 2000 and 2009. In particular, we study the effect of technological crowdedness, strategic use of in-house knowledge stock and invention radicalness on the option for the publication of pre-grant patent applications. The variables relate the reason to opt-out of patent application publication to industry characteristics (competition), firm's characteristics (internal knowledge) and innovation characteristics (radicalness). Results show a negative association between technological crowdedness and pre-grant secrecy, as well as between secrecy and the use of in-house knowledge stock. Conversely, radicalness is positively associated with the likelihood of a patent application being secret until its granting.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Intellectual Property Protection and Financial Markets: Patenting versus Secrecy,Trade secrets; Patents; Intellectual property; Stock liquidity; TRIPS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TRADE SECRETS; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; CROSS-SECTION; RIGHTS; INFORMATION; LIQUIDITY; DECISIONS; INFERENCE; WINNERS,"Firms rely on patenting and trade secrecy to protect their intellectual property. We study how changes in the trade-off between patenting and secrecy affect firms' stock liquidity and financing outcomes. We show that an international trade agreement (TRIPS) that strengthened patent protection led to a 10.2% increase in patenting, accompanied by a 14.0%-27.1% improvement in stock liquidity for firms in patent-reliant industries. This in turn allows the affected firms to increase equity financing by 1.9% and reduce leverage by 5.9%. Our results suggest that policies that promote use of patenting over secrecy can reduce informational frictions in equity markets.",2021,Business & Economics,0
Does licensing improve welfare with rent dissipation?,Licensing; Patent competition; Rent dissipation; Welfare; Overlapping research expenditure; Patent protection; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT; SEEKING; INNOVATION; MARKET; SECRECY; RACES; SCOPE; FEE,"Licensing generally improves welfare as markets become competitive with technology diffusion. However, as licensing increases the value of a patent, the welfare gain may be offset by increased rent dissipation from additional overlapping research efforts. We consider Cournot oligopolists engaging in a patent competition for a cost-reducing innovation where the competition's winner may license the patent to its rivals. We show that although licensing always increases the incentive to innovate, it may reduce welfare for minor innovations but generally does not improve welfare for major ones. Our result is consistent with recent policy reforms that patent protection should focus on major innovations.",2021,Business & Economics,0

We find that strengthening patent protection has a positive effect on economic growth and a positive or an inverted-U effect on income inequality when the number of differentiated products is fixed in the short run. However, when the number of products adjusts endogenously, the effects of patent protection on growth and inequality become negative in the long run. We also calibrate the model to US data to perform a quantitative analysis and find that the long-run negative effect of patent policy on inequality is much larger than its short-run positive effect. This result remains consistent with our empirical finding from a panel vector autoregression.",2021,Business & Economics,0
Optimal use of patents and trade secrets for complex innovations,Patents; Trade secrets; Intellectual property rights; Patent-secret combination; ,"This paper studies how an inventor protects a complex innovation that involves multiple complementary components. Each component can be protected through either patent or secrecy protection, so that the entire innovation may be protected through a patent-secret combination. Potential entrants might acquire these components either through costly imitation or licensing. I find that, first, secrecy is optimal when the patent length is relatively short; otherwise, a patent-secret combination is optimal; second, the inventor is over-rewarded compared to an inventor with an innovation that is equivalent except that it involves only a single-component so that the entire innovation can be protected through either patent or secrecy protection; and, third, a policy that precludes the use of a patent secret combination enhances allocative efficiency ex-post but may stifle R&D incentives ex-ante.

The KPIs are based on a literature review and a content analysis of the webpages of IP offices in countries offering UM protection in 2021. Generally, the IP offices highlight UMs to be shorter, simpler, faster, and cheaper protection methods compared to patents but there are differences how these features are highlighted. The differences between UMs and patents lead to multidimensional sorting as economic agents choose within the IP menu which determine the observed differences in characteristics and outcomes of patents and UMs. National differences call for separate context-dependent KPIs for UM systems.",2023,Information Science & Library Science,0

Using a large dataset of Polish patent applications, 2006-2015, and the econometric model of logistic regression with interactions, the article identifies factors contributing to the successful patenting outcomes. Patents are more likely to be granted for applications filed by multiple applicants, particularly if a scientific organization is involved. Industry, region and decisions to apply for international protection were found as relevant variables affecting the patent grants. The involvement of attorneys was found to be a strong predictor of the outcome, and the study considered multiple variables characterizing the prior experience of attorneys, including their performance, effectiveness, work with scientific or business clients and support for patent applications that were also filed for international protection. The findings offer novel insights into sources of patenting success, indicating that it's not only important how the patent applications are drafted and what their detailed contents are, but also who exactly prepares them.",2022,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,0
The reward and contract theories of patents in a model of endogenous growth,Innovation; Patent policy; Patent thickets; Patent puzzle; Trade secrets; Endogenous growth; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; SCHUMPETERIAN MODEL; TRADE SECRETS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; BLOCKING PATENTS; BIG SECRETS; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; COMPETITION,"I develop a general equilibrium model of endogenous growth to jointly analyze two distinct theories of the patent system's social value: (1) that patents stimulate innovation by enhancing private incentives to invest in R&D (reward theory) and (2) that patents disseminate technical information into the public domain through disclosure requirements (contract theory). The model features endogenous innovator selection into patents versus secrecy based on heterogeneous innovation size, the effective cost of disclosure, and expected licensing revenue from holding a patent. Innovation is cumulative, patent rights overlap across industries, and new innovators pay mandatory licensing fees to a subset of previous innovators if those innovators hold a patent. The economy's endogenous patent propensity determines each new innovator's licensing burden, consistent with the concept of patent thickets. The model captures the inherent tension between the two objectives of the patent system. In most cases, I find that stronger patent protection stifles innovation and reduces social welfare.",2022,Business & Economics,0

Depending on these relative effects, protection can in theory increase or decrease markups, imitation, innovation, growth, and aggregate productivity.

Applying the estimation method of conditional average treatment effect by Lee, Okui, and Whang (2017) to Chinese firm data, I show the graphic representation of the non-linearity that characterizes the heterogeneous average treatment effects of patenting and importing activities on firm productivity. The graphic results suggest that the productivity effect of patenting is positively influenced by local IPRs protection, while that of importing is initially negatively and subsequently positively affected by IPRs protection. I also find that overstrict protection of IPRs may diminish the productivity impact of both channels, and private-owned firms rely more on IPRs protection to enhance productivity through filing patents.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Pricing Decision of Closed-Loop Supply Chain to Improve Service Level under Patent Protection,closed-loop supply chain; differential pricing; patent protection; service level; COMPETITION; MODELS,"This paper constructs a two-level closed-loop supply chain system consisting of original parts manufacturers and parts distributors. Based on the different preferences of consumers for remanufactured parts and new parts, four combination models of patent protection and service improvement are constructed. Through comparative analysis, the impact of implementing patent protection policies by original parts manufacturers and improving service levels by parts distributors on the pricing decisions of the closed-loop supply chain is explored.Through the comparison between related models and the verification of calculation examples, it is found that (1) a manufacturer prevents the price of new products from being affected by the price of remanufactured products and upgrading of service level by introducing royalties, which reduces its loss of profit; (2) in the absence of patent protection, the manufacturer's profit decreases as the level of service increases; in the presence of patent protection, the manufacturer's profit increases as the level of service increases; (3) retailers' profits decrease after the manufacturer introduces royalties, which discourages them to improve service levels for remanufactured products; (4) as retailers raise the service level of the remanufactured products, the profits of the manufacturer and third-party manufacturers keep increasing, while the profits of the retailers first increase and then decrease.",2023,Engineering,0
Effective Strategies to Patent Plastic Surgery Ideas and Intellectual Property,; INNOVATION,"Patents are of great importance to plastic surgery, a field fueled by constant innovation. Familiarity with the patent process could promote further innovation by plastic surgeons. By granting proprietary rights to inventors in exchange for publication of their inventions, patents incentivize creativity and innovation while promoting diffusion and transfer of technology. The task of securing patent protection, however, is complex, and begins well before the patent application. Inventors must familiarize themselves with regulations to ensure that their inventions satisfy the criteria for patentability, which can differ among countries. Patents regarding surgical methods should undergo additional ethical deliberation given their potential interference with medical altruism. The patent application must be devised and written thoroughly, as it needs to withstand meticulous examination by patent offices and potential third-party opposition, and professional assistance in doing so should be sought. Filing of the application calls for intricate procedural and timing requirements that bear major benefits if well understood and respected by applicants. Given that patent rights only cover the issuing country's territorial scope, further endeavors must be pursued when seeking patent protection in additional countries. In this regard, two options exist, and the ultimate decision should be tailored to each inventor's personal needs. At every step of the patenting process, financial readiness is key because costs can be unpredictable and escalate quickly. In this article, the authors propose effective strategies directed at plastic surgeons to facilitate patenting of their ideas and protection of their intellectual property.",2023,Surgery,0

We incorporate patent protection into a Schumpeterian growth model in which take-off occurs when the population size crosses an endogenous threshold. We find that strengthening patent protection has contrasting effects on economic growth at different stages of development. Specifically, it leads to an earlier take-off but also reduces economic growth in the long run.",2020,Demography; Business & Economics,0
An overview of patents on therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in Europe: are they a hurdle to biosimilar market entry?,Intellectual property strategies; patents; biopharmaceutical market; monoclonal antibodies; biosimilars; ,"As patents on many high-selling biological medicines are expiring, non-innovator versions, such as biosimilars, may enter this multi-billion dollar market. This study aims to map patents and patent applications for innovator as well as biosimilar monoclonal antibodies in Europe, and investigates legal challenges associated with patenting the innovator product and alleged infringing activities, focusing on consequences for biosimilar developers. Via an exploratory literature review in PubMed and a database analysis in Darts-ip, Derwent Innovation, and Espacenet, an overview of basic patents and exclusivity rights for some of the best-selling biologicals is given, supplemented with a detailed analysis of patents taken during the medicine's life cycle via three specific case studies (trastuzumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab). Case law was used to determine which patents were viewed by biosimilar developers as blocking market entry. For the selected monoclonal antibodies, the key protection instruments appeared to be the basic patent and the additional protection provided by a supplementary protection certificate. We observed that additional patents filed after the basic patent are hard to obtain and often insufficient in blocking market entry of biosimilars, but can in some cases be a substantial hurdle for biosimilar developers to overcome in patent litigation cases or to invent around, creating uncertainty on the launch date of a biosimilar on the market. These hurdles, however, seem to be surmountable, given that many cases were won by biosimilar developers. Also, biosimilars can be protected by filing new patents and these mainly pertain to new formulations.",2020,Research & Experimental Medicine,0

Taking the PPH agreements signed between China and the export destinations as a quasi-natural experiment, we established a difference-in-difference-in-differences model. We found that international cooperation for patent examination caused firms to increase export quality to PPH partners in patent-intensive industries to a greater extent. This effect was more profound among PPH partners with stronger intellectual property protection, differentiated products and core products, and agreements along with the Patent Cooperation Treaty. We also found that PPH agreements increased the number of Chinese patent applications filed in PPH partners, patent applications by PPH partners in China, and the level of innovation, all of which constitute the major channels through which export quality to PPH partners increases. Our findings demonstrate that international patent cooperation has played an important role in promoting international trade quality.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Intellectual property infringement by foreign firms: Import protection through the ITC or court,Intellectual property; Patent infringement; Royalty; International Trade Commission; Import injunctions; Administered protection; RIGHTS,"This paper examines intellectual property litigation as a method of protection from patent -infringing imports. Claims against patent-infringing imports entering the United States may be filed before the International Trade Commission (ITC) or in district court. The ITC applies in-junctions (import prohibitions) that would seem to provide more protection from infringing imports than the standard license fee remedy in court. Settlements prior to legal adjudication are common in both venues. Using a model with Nash bargaining and Cournot competition, we show that an ITC filing may restrict imports by less than in court. This result tends to apply if product differentiation is high and the size of the patented cost-reducing innovation is large.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2023,Business & Economics,0

The results of this paper, in agreement with predictions of current financial theory, indicate that patent real option value increases when the following input factor conditions exist: increased patent asset value, longer time to the expiration of patent protection, higher interest rates, larger variability of future values of the patent asset, decreased patent commercialisation investment, and lower cost of delay in commercialisation investment decisions. Furthermore, patent real option value sensitivities are estimated for each of these input factors of the binomial decision tree model. More broadly, the paper provides a novel valuation tool for the monetary appraisal of patents and contributes to the IP literature on devising timely indicators of innovative activities.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Biopharmaceutical patent protection vs. generic drug competition: Traversing the public policy tightrope,; ,"The Support Technology & Research for Our Nation's Growth and Economic Resilience (STRONGER) Patents Act, introduced in the 115th Congress, focuses on inter partes review (IPR) and post-grant review (PGR) proceedings that challenge patent validity at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB). Quinn, Brachmann, Malone, and Morinville (2018) evaluated patent data for the PTAB covering the first five plus years (through 2017) of the PTAB's operations, and calculate an 82.5% defect rate, i.e., where at least one patent claim is determined invalid and thus the invention not patentable. This finding could signal serious problems either with patent examination quality at the USPTO or with an aggressive PTAB. For recommended future research, further analysis of more recent (2018-21) patent-related validity data should be undertaken, as well as investigating the impact of the recently enacted CREATES Act on the relative strength of biopharmaceutical patent protection.",2022,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0

This study outlines the depository management patterns of microorganisms and information related to their current development and urgency. This research uses comparative legal methods to determine the characteristics of the depository of microorganisms for patent application purposes between the Indonesian Patent Law, the Budapest Treaty, and Nagoya Protocols. It was later discovered that this preparation procedure was correlated with fulfilling patent registration obligations within the framework of legal protection and had the function to protect genetic resources and comply with the provisions of the Nagoya Protocol, which the Government of Indonesia has ratified.

The implementation of China's strict and new Environmental Protection Law provides a quasi-natural experimental setting for examining the causal effect of environmental regulation on corporate green innovation. Based on data of the application for environmental patents of high-polluting firms listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2010 to 2017, this study analyses the change in the green innovation behaviour of firms after the implementation of China's new and stringent Environmental Protection Law using the PSM-DID approach. We find that firms tend to file more applications for environmental patents, including patents for inventions and utility models after the implementation of the new Environmental Protection Law. Further analysis shows that while this effect is stronger for state-owned enterprises, it is weaker for firms headquartered in cities where economies depend more on the secondary industry. Firms in concentrated industries have more incentive to file applications for green invention patents than those in competitive industries. The study has important implications for policy makers on better implementing the environmental protection law in developing countries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

MOTIVES TO PATENT: EVIDENCE FROM ARGENTINE MANUFACTURING FIRMS,patent; appropriability; innovation; protection; competition; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; INNOVATION; APPROPRIATION; PROPENSITY; SMES,"According to the literature on appropriation, firms patent mainly to prevent copy. However, given that innovation and patents form part of firms' broader competitive strategies, patenting can include many other objectives such as blocking, increasing prestige and improving bargaining power, among others. The evidence about this kind of strategic and competitive use of patents is extensive for developed countries but almost null for developing countries. This paper aims to contribute to filling this gap in two ways: firstly, by analysing Argentine firms' motivations for patenting and, secondly, by exploring the determinants of such motivations. The data used comes from the most recent Argentine innovation survey (ENDEI II), which provides information on around 300 manufacturing firms that applied for patents between 2014 and 2016. The findings show that Argentine firms follow one of two composite patenting strategies, the most common one being guided by objectives related to protection, including different types of blocking, and the other being guided by the less technological goals identified by the literature on strategic patenting, such as prestige, bargaining and licences.",2022,Business & Economics,0

We further explore the role of ability of information identification on environmental technology. The results demonstrate that there is a promotional effect of cognitive diversity on acquisition of environmental patent and independent environmental innovation by promoting ability of information identification. Finally, the results of heterogeneity analysis show that cognitive diversity in those environmental protection enterprises with high-level technology has a significant effect on independent environmental innovation.

Location Matters: a Novel Methodology for Patent's National Phase Process,Strategic patenting; Technology transfer; Patent analysis; Patent valuation; Patent license; National phases; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; STRATEGIES; TECHNOLOGY; COUNTRIES,"The patents which never have marketed are unsuccessful innovations. The patent's national phases are an indispensable process for the marketing of innovation. In this process, patent owners decide in which countries they want to get protection. Despite being an essential issue that generates significant competitive advantages over competitors and relevant for technology transfer and patent licence, few discussions are on this issue. Indeed, the institutions for which this is a new practice cannot find much literature guiding them. Thus, the paper provides a novel methodology to identify the potential countries for applying. Overall, the proposed methodology uses patent analysis and market research methods to define the value of a technology, and the target countries to perform patent filings as an international technological strategy. This paper analyses a case to illustrate step by step how it is possible to use affordable market and technology data to select the countries in which a patent must be protected. The methodology for patent's national phases may contribute to (i) define the selection process to establish nations in which patent protection is necessary instead of proposing a set of general recommendations and (ii) how a guide to delineate comparative advantages and market possibilities.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Licensing and secrecy under imperfect intellectual property protection,Patents; Trade secrets; Licensing; Technology transfer; Imitation; Leakage; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; INNOVATION; PERSISTENCE; IMITATION; POLICY; FEES,"I consider a technology holder that has to decide whether to file for a patent or rely on secrecy, and a competing firm that can enter the market through technology transfer or imitation. Acknowledging that imitation is uncertain, imperfect, and takes time to materialise, as well as that intellectual property protection is not absolute, I find that technology transfer will always occur if the technological efficiency to imitate is sufficiently low. This will happen regardless of the protection choice of the inventor. Conversely, highly efficient imitation technologies will lead to imitation instead of licensing. I also consider that a trade secret might accidentally leak and thus lose its economic value, thereby rendering secrecy less preferable to patenting. Additionally, the risk of leakage might also lead to more imitation than licensing. Finally, considering that, in practice, the probability of leakage might increase with the number of firms practising a secret, I suggest an increase in the attractiveness of the patent system.",2024,Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,0

Design/methodology/approachThis paper developed an empirical model by using panel data of 42 China's patent-intensive industries to investigate the economic contribution made by Chinese patent-intensive manufacturing industries. FindingsThis paper found that the intensity of valid patents is strongly positively related to economic growth. The intensity of yearly added patents presented an inverse U-shaped and a U-shaped curve with the economy made by China's patent-intensive industries. The correlativity mainly depended on whether the patent intensity converges near the economic indicators. Meanwhile, from the perspective of input-output efficiency, for China's patent-intensive industries, R&D institutes were overinvested, followed by R&D intensity and R&D staff. Originality/valueInvestigating patent influence on economic development is quite complex research. Existing studies have mainly focused on patent protection in legal systems, but have not provided a definitive answer to what the real influence is. This study sought to narrow this gap from the patent economy perspective.",2022,Business & Economics,0

Using novel survey data on Japanese firms' licensing activities between 2008 and 2010, our empirical investigation finds that more competitors in licensors' product markets lead to more licenses whereas more competitors in licensees' product markets lead to fewer licenses. Further, empirical results also show that patent protection elicits opposite effects in the two stages such that patented technologies are more likely to be licensed but to fewer licensees, compared with non-patented technologies. Finally, the effects of product market competition and patent appear to interact in their joint influence on the number of licenses.",2022,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,0

Outward-bound international patenting is contrasted with domestic patenting and with inward-bound international patenting. The empirical analysis establishes plausible evidence that outward-bound international patenting matters for economic development. The main conclusion, based on empirical research about the patenting profiles of 78 countries over 14 years, is that countries whose residents exhibit a relatively high proclivity for obtaining foreign patent protection for endogenous inventions are likely to enjoy relatively high levels of wealth per person. An implication of this conclusion is that the exploitation by national residents of foreign markets for the commercialization of endogenous technology through the sophisticated use of the intellectual property systems of foreign countries is an important factor for national economic development.",2020,Engineering; Business & Economics,0
The Research Patent,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; UTILITY REQUIREMENT; ECONOMICS; RETHINKING; SCIENCE; NORMS; LAW; INFRINGEMENT; DISCLOSURE; INNOVATION,"The patent system gives courts the discretion to tailor patentability standards flexibly across technologies to provide optimal incentives for innovation. For chemical inventions, the courts deem them unpatentable if the chemical lacks a practical, non-research-based use at the time patent protection is sought. The fear is that an early-stage patent on a research input would confer too much control over yet-unknown uses for the chemical, thereby potentially hindering downstream innovation. Yet, denying patents on research inputs can frustrate patent law's broad goal of protecting and promoting scientific and technological advances. This Article addresses this problem by proposing a new form of intellectual property a research patent. This regime would allow inventors to obtain patents on research inputs and extract their full value through licensing and enforcement. Research patents would impose minimal administrative costs on the patent system and ultimately promote the disclosure, development, and use of early-stage inventions. At a broader level, the proposed regime raises the theoretical question of how allowing patent protection on early-stage inventions like research inputs serves patent law's instrumental justification of promoting scientific progress. It also raises significant normative and policy questions about technology-specific patentability standards and their role in furthering the goals of the patent system.",2021,Government & Law,0

We find a significant increase in patents and patent citations for firms headquartered in cities that have adopted such policies relative to firms headquartered in cities that have not. We further show that patent pledgeability increases corporate patenting by inducing firms to shift from secrecy-based innovation to patent-based innovation, rather than by mitigating financial constraints.",2024,Business & Economics,0

In the 1930s, the Fashion Originators Guild of America (FOGA) created an internal system to protect its members' design work, but in 1941 this system was declared in restraint of trade, and the next best protection option laid in the US design patent system. This research examines the 4,523 dress patents issued in the United States between 1936 and 1942, focusing on the designers and/or manufacturers represented and the process and timing of patent applications. Analysis of select court cases of design patent infringement, including a case study of a patent for The Perfect Dress by leading FOGA member and ready-to-wear dress manufacturer Samuel Zahn, demonstrates the difficulty of protecting a patented dress design and the complicated nature of what constituted an original design.",2023,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,0
Patent eligibility after Alice: Evidence from USPTO patent examination,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; MARKET; INNOVATION; OFFICE; IMPACT,"In a series of decisions over the last decade, the Supreme Court of the United States altered the classes of inventions that are eligible for patent protection-a body of law called subject matter eligibility. One of the more contentious of these decisions, Alice Corp. versus CLS Bank International (Alice), questioned the patentability of a broad class of inventions involving abstract ideas, particularly in digital technologies. Exploiting a quasinatural experiment, we find that the Alice decision reduced favorable patent eligibility decisions by 31% and significantly and persistently increased legal uncertainty in patent examination by 26% for a broad set of technologies. Our analysis quantifies how legal decisions can limit patent protection and highlights the need for further research on how greater legal uncertainty affects upstream investments supporting invention and downstream innovations fueling growth.",2024,Business & Economics,0

In modern times, has become necessary for business organizations to get the patent and intellectual property legal rights for the business. There is a lack of legal regulations in Iraq related to the patent due to the weak judicial system. This study is conducted to understand the important role of intellectual property and patents to improve the business performance in Iraq. The findings of this research demonstrate in Iraq, there is the critical importance of new laws and regulations related to a patent for the protection of businesses' intellectual property to avoid the manipulation of customers. This study concludes patent laws are necessary to protect the intellectual property right of a business to provide sustainable growth.

On Conflicts between Pharmaceutical Patent Protection and the Right to Life and Health Based on a Stackelberg Game,pharmaceutical patent; public health; excess profit tax; Stackelberg game; ,"To solve the conflict between pharmaceutical patent protection and the right to life, health and increased patient satisfaction, drug prices can be regulated by levying an excess profit tax. An optimal tax strategy was formulated that not only could lower drug prices and improve public health and welfare, but also considers companies' earnings. The strategy was based on the Stackelberg game theory as a bi-level mathematical model. In the model, the government is the leader, with patient satisfaction as the main goal, and pharmaceutical companies are the followers, with maximum drug revenue as the goal. The results show that under the premise of ensuring sufficient incentives for patent holders, the optimized tax on excess profit can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of pharmaceutical patent protection, alleviate the failure of market regulation of drug prices, improve patient satisfaction, and increase total social welfare.",2021,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0
Assessment of patentability by means of semantic patent analysis-A mathematical-logical approach,Patentability; Novelty; Non-obviousness; Semantic analysis; Claim features; Claim chart; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; NOVELTY; SEARCH,"To obtain patent protection, a patent must fulfill statutory patentability requirements examined by a patent office. Such examinations are mostly performed manually and are quite time-consuming. Therefore, we suggest a computer-based process for the assessment of patentability by means of a mathematical-logical approach comparing patents with semantic structures. In order to make such an assessment, we compare the feature combinations of patent claims with the pertinent prior art. For proof of concept, the process has been tested successfully on an US-application claiming a method for raising a crane boom which can be categorized as nonpatentable with regard to the requirement of non-obviousness. The result is consistent with that of a USPTO patent examiner, which underpins that at least under certain conditions not only patent examiners but also applicants and third parties can assess the chance and scope of protection for claimed inventions and patent applications with regard to patentability by our process.",2023,Information Science & Library Science,0
"An Orange Book Landscape: Drugs, Patents, and Generic Competition",; PRESCRIPTION DRUGS; PHARMACEUTICALS; APPROVAL; PRICES,"Patents are widely considered to be a critical incentive for drug development because they allow manufacturers to recoup investments in research and development activities. However, patents are also criticized for preventing competition and contributing to higher prices. To better understand the patent landscape for approved drug products and the relationship between patents, other exclusivities, and generic competition, we examined all prescription drug products listed in the Orange Book as of February 2021. Surprisingly, only 31% to 39% of drug products had any remaining patent protection as of this date, meaning the majority of approved drug products are unencumbered by patents. This finding remained true even when regulatory exclusivities were considered. We also found that generic drug approval occurred despite the presence of patent protection in 28% of cases, and that patent expiration was not followed by generic drug approval in 32% of cases. These findings suggest that even valid patents do not necessarily block competition, as is commonly believed, and that dramatic price decreases often cannot be expected when patents expire. As scholars and policymakers craft policies aimed at controlling drug prices, they should seek to better understand how factors other than patents and regulatory exclusivities affect generic competition and patient health.",2022,Food Science & Technology; Government & Law; Nutrition & Dietetics; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0

Patent invalidation during drug development renders data exclusivity the sole source of protection and shifts the period of market exclusivity. In instrumental variables regressions, we quantify the effect of a one-year reduction in expected market exclusivity on the likelihood of drug commercialization. The effect is largely driven by patent invalidations early in the drug development process and by the responses of large originators.

Optimal Patent Protection Length for Vital Pharmaceuticals in the Age of COVID-19,patents; social welfare; innovation; R&D incentives; pharmaceutical industry; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; KNOWLEDGE; INDUSTRY; LIFE,"The highly unequal access to COVID-19 vaccines observed at a critical moment of the pandemic coupled with the considerable profits cashed by the main vaccine producers have brought the debates on patent protection back into sharp focus. The trade-off between the need to encourage innovation through patent protection and the right of populations across the world to access life-saving pharmaceutical products raises important concerns that go beyond innovation stimulation. This paper leans on the inclusion of non-economic considerations based on social identity theory in optimization strategies to analyze the arguments underlying the patent length in the pharmaceutical industry and questions the measurement of social benefits of innovation in the Nordhaus's model in its applicability to the case of vital pharmaceuticals. It proposes some new considerations akin to extra welfarism in the microeconomic analysis of the social welfare underlying traditional arguments in support of long patent protection periods. Simplified comparative statics are employed to show that, from the social welfare point of view, an incentive system in which a reward equivalent to the discounted profits is remitted to the innovator yields higher social welfare than monopoly protection without diminishing the incentive to innovate. These results suggest that in the case of vital medicines such as vaccines and antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment, social welfare is maximized by imposing compulsory licensing and making treatment accessible to all (potentially) infected citizens.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Employing the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA) that accelerated the publication of patent applications, we find that accelerated dissemination of patenting information increases stock price crash risk. This effect is stronger when treated firms are technologically closer to their rival firms and more concerned about proprietary costs. Further analyses indicate that, the heightened crash risk following the AIPA is attributable to managers shifting towards less timely bad news disclosures. Overall, our study documents that accelerated dissemination of patenting information induces managers to strategically withhold negative information, which adds to the comprehension of what and how (un)ethical decisions are undertaken by managers.",2024,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0
What growth policies protect the environment?

Pollution is a by-product of the intermediate goods, and can be reduced by public abatement activities. The results show that, compared to subsidies, stronger patent protection is a more promising tool for achieving a double dividend, i.e., simultaneously enhancing growth and improving the environment. By contrast, a uniform increase in the subsidy rate on R&D and capital stimulates growth but harms the environment, implying a trade -off relationship between growth and the environment. For sector-specific subsidies, an R&D subsidy is superior to a capital subsidy in terms of environmental protection, but this superiority fades away if the productivity of abatement labor or the public abatement expenditure is higher.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Has China Established a Green Patent System?

Changes in economic development strategies affect corresponding changes in the legal system. The green patent system has an important impact on sustainable development. This paper looks for evidence at the system level from the three aspects of patent application protection, patent licensing and patent infringement relief, and proves the penetration of the green principle in the patent system, which is mainly reflected in the following points: (1) in terms of patent application, concrete public interest clauses, exclusion of non-green technologies from patentable objects, and open green channels for green technology patent applications to speed up examination; (2) in terms of patent licensing, exploration of the application of compulsory patent licensing to green patents for environmental protection, and improvement of patent open licensing to encourage the open sharing of green patents; (3) in terms of patent infringement remedies, the introduction of the green principle at an appropriate time to limit the right to stop infringement claims, and the application of punitive damages for intentional infringement and serious damage to the ecological environment. The conclusion is that China is currently working to establish a green patent framework, but the specific details have yet to be perfected, and the impact of legislative changes on green technology development remains to be seen.

Pricing new and remanufactured products under patent protection and government intervention,Pricing; Remanufacturing; Patent protection; Government intervention; Strategic consumer behaviour; Consumers' green preference; LOOP SUPPLY CHAIN; STRATEGIC CONSUMERS; COMPETITION; DECISION; RETURNS,"This study proposes a three-period closed-loop supply chain model framework with remanufacturing, in which an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sells the new products through the entire selling season, and a remanufacturer collects the used products and sells the remanufactured products in the third period to a group of strategic consumers with green preferences. In the basic model, firms determine their respective prices to pursue profit maximization, considering consumers' strategic behaviour and green preference. Then, we extend the model by incorporating patent protection and government intervention and investigate their impacts on firms' operational strategies, profitability, and consumer surplus. Our results show that all the optimal prices increase in the costs of the new and remanufactured products, while the optimal licensing fee strictly decreases in both marginal costs. We further uncover that consumers' strategic behaviour can alleviate but consumers' green preference will exacerbate the effects of marginal costs on product prices. Compared with the basic model, under patent protection and government intervention, one can see that government subsidies help more consumers find an ideal product rather than leave the market with nothing. In particular, it boosts sales of the remanufactured product and improves the performance of the remanufacturer's profitability, although the OEM charges a higher patent-licensing fee. Interestingly, the profit of the OEM also increases in the per-unit government subsidy because the OEM could benefit indirectly from government subsidies through its patent-licensing revenue. Based on the combined effects of patent protection and government intervention, we therefore propose an efficient and easy-to-implement subsidy/tax scheme, which can assist the social planner in encouraging firms to set prices at the level of reaching social welfare maximization.",2023,Operations Research & Management Science,0

We obtain causal estimates by comparing US patents subject to AIPA with twin European patents that were not. Post-AIPA, US patents receive more and faster follow-on citations, indicating greater technology diffusion.

"Patents and regulatory exclusivities on FDA-approved insulin products: A longitudinal database study, 1986-2019",; DRUG,"Background Insulin is the primary treatment for type 1 and some type 2 diabetes but remains costly in the United States, even though it was discovered more than a century ago. High prices can lead to nonadherence and are often sustained by patents and regulatory exclusivities that limit competition on brand-name products. We sought to examine how manufacturers have used patents and regulatory exclusivities on insulin products approved from 1986 to 2019 to extend periods of market exclusivity. Methods and findings We used the publicly available Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) to identify all approved biosynthetic insulin products. Individual products approved under the same New Drug Application (NDA)-e.g., a vial and pen-were considered as separate products for the purposes of analysis. We recorded all patents and regulatory exclusivities listed in the Orange Book on each product and used Google Patents to extract the timing of patent application and whether patents were obtained on delivery devices or others aspects of the product. The primary outcome was the duration of expected protection, which was determined by subtracting the FDA approval date for each product from its last-to-expire patent or regulatory exclusivity (whichever occurred later). We performed a secondary analysis that considered overall protection on insulin lines-defined as groups of products approved under the same NDA with the same active ingredients manufactured by the same company. We also examined competition from follow-on insulin products-defined as products approved with the same active ingredients as originators but manufactured by different companies (approved via a specific drug approval pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). During the study period, the FDA approved 56 individual products across 25 different insulin lines and 5 follow-ons across 3 different insulin lines. Thirty-three (59%) of the 56 products were drug-device combinations. Manufacturers of 9 products approved during the study period obtained patents filed after FDA approval that extended their duration of expected protection (by a median of 6 years). Approximately 63% of all patents on drug-device combinations approved during the study period were related to delivery devices. The median duration of expected protection on insulin products was 16.0 years, and the median protection on insulin lines was 17.6 years. An important limitation of our analysis is that manufacturers may continue to add patents on existing insulin products while competitors may challenge patents; therefore, periods of protection may change over time. Conclusions Among several strategies that insulin manufacturers have employed to extend periods of market exclusivity on brand-name insulin products are filing patents after FDA approval and obtaining a large number of patents on delivery devices. Policy reforms are needed to promote timely competition in the pharmaceutical market and ensure that patients have access to low-cost drugs.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,0

In this paper, we investigate this question using novel product-level data on mobile apps, in which we relate the use of both patents and copyright to (i) revenue performance and (ii) IP licensing. We theorize that these relationships depend on differences in product-level characteristics and that apps differentiated by their design are more likely and effectively to be protected by patents; apps combining elements of differentiated content are more likely and effectively protected by copyright. Our results support these predictions that product characteristics shape the appropriate contingent use of patent and copyright protection in digital products. These patterns are especially relevant to industries where digital products combine elements of differentiated design and differentiated digital content.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Analysis of impacts of climate change on the grant and protection of patents related to the water industry,climate variables; compulsory exploitation license; intellectual property rights; three-stage test; water management; SCENARIOS,"Various inventions are presented in the water industry, essential for the water supply, distribution, treatment, storage, and consumption optimization. It is necessary to confirm their novelty, innovative steps, and industrial applicability to protect water-related patents. However, the impacts of climate change are not considered in the granting of patents, and water-related inventions are registered or rejected regardless of these impacts. For example, an invention that causes greenhouse gas emissions may be patented because it is new. This research addresses this significant challenge using a descriptive-analytical approach and a library-field method. Based on the results, it is necessary to impose strictness on inventions that aggravate climate change (29% of the inventions investigated) and protect inventions that adapt to climate change impacts (71%). Furthermore, it is possible to use the tool of compulsory licensing to adapt to climate change and reduce its negative impacts. Moreover, the patent offices should evaluate climate change impacts by examining innovative steps and industrial applications. An invention that has negative impacts will be deprived of patent protection and considered one of the limitations and exceptions. Also, it is necessary to provide new interpretations of protection elements of the patent system.",2023,Water Resources,0

We also suggest that environmental munificence moderates this nonlinear relationship such that a low-munificent environment accentuates the potentially detrimental (beneficial) effects of low-to-medium (medium-to-high) levels of family ownership on patents.

We find that such increased innovation disclosure helps firms switch lenders, resulting in lower cost of debt, and facilitates their access to syndicated-loan and public capital markets. Our evidence lends support to the idea that public-information provision through patents and private information in financial relationships are substitutes, and that innovation disclosure makes credit markets more contestable.",2021,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,0

Our study shows that information flows from patents measured by forward citations, increased. Interestingly, the degree of localization within geographic boundaries remained unchanged and technological localization even increased moderately.

The systems of public procurement needed to adapt in a very short time to reach agreements with the pharmaceutical industry. OBJECTIVE: Proposing options between the waiving of patent protections and innovative public procurement, principally the European Advance Purchase Agreements (APA). METHODS: A description of the actual situation and the necessary regulatory reforms. The sources are scientific articles, legislative compendiums and opinion pieces and the current press. RESULTS: The debate over the waiving of patent protections at this time is both misleading and ineffective due to the economic and legal problems involved. The path of the APA has proven to be very effective, although some deficits should be corrected, principally regarding questions of transparency and confidentiality. CONCLUSIONS: Among the possible options for the acquisition of the COVID-19 vaccine and its universal access, agreements and cooperation between States and innovative industry are desirable. One successful path is that of the advance purchase agreements utilized by the European Union, another could be that of voluntary licensing.

Which is the most effective innovation protection method for different types of product innovation?Evidence from South Korean manufacturing firms,Legal innovation protection method; non-legal innovation protection method; product innovation; types of product innovation; PERFORMANCE,"Securing appropriation is crucial for firms to retain their competitive advantage. This article empirically examines the effects of different types of innovation protection methods on different types of product innovation. The study considers six types of innovation protection methods which can be used during product development: patents, a utility model, designs, confidentiality, complex designs, and market preoccupation. Four types of product innovation are considered: product quality improvements, product cost reductions, product diversification, and pioneering a new market. The main findings are as follows: (1) Patents have a positive effect on pioneering a new market compared to other product innovation types. This result means that patents are effective for product innovations with completely novel characteristics. (2) Market preoccupation is most effective for improving quality, reducing costs, and enhancing product diversification compared to other innovation protection methods.",2022,Business & Economics,0

Appropriability and basicness of R&D: Identifying and characterising product and process inventions in patent data,; PROCESS INNOVATION; COMPETITIVE PRESSURE; CHOICE; SPILLOVERS; KNOWLEDGE; RETURNS,"We present a database that classifies all patent applications filed at either the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or the European Patent Office (EPO) as being either product patents, process patents or 'mixed patents'. We use the share of claims that refer to either product or process inventions which allows to classify all patent applications along a continuum of pure process patents and pure product patents. We find that process-oriented patents draw more on previous knowledge, are more original and more radical than product patents. Lower breadth of protection is positively associated with pure process patenting, whereas product and mixed variants can be protected more broadly. This characterisation uncovers heterogeneity of patented inventions that allows for a more sophisticated use of patent statistics. It can improve the accuracy of analyses, but also reveal new aspects related to property rights.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
An Empirical Review of Key Glucose Monitoring Devices: Product Iterations and Patent Protection,insulin; glucometer; diabetes; medical devices; patents; METERS,"Introduction: Each year, people with diabetes and their insurers or governments spend billions of dollars on blood glucose monitors and their associated components. These monitors have evolved substantially since their introduction in the 1970s, and manufacturers frequently protect original medical devices and their modifications by applying for and obtaining patent protection.Research Design and Methods: We tracked the product iterations of five widely used blood glucose monitors-manufactured by LifeScan, Dexcom, Abbott, Roche, and Trividia-from information published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and extracted relevant U.S. patents.Results: We found 384 products made by the five manufacturers of interest, including 130 devices cleared through the 510(k) pathway, 251 approved via the premarket approval (PMA) pathway or via PMA supplements, and three for which de novo requests were granted. We identified 8095 patents potentially relevant to these devices, 2469 (31%) of which were likely to have expired by July 2021.Conclusions: Manufacturers of blood glucose monitoring systems frequently modified their devices and obtained patent protection related to these device modifications. The therapeutic value of these new modifications should be critically evaluated and balanced against their additional cost. Older glucose monitoring devices that were marketed in decades past are now in the public domain and no longer protected by patents. Newer devices will join them as their patents expire. Increased demand from people with diabetes and the health care system for older, off-patent devices would provide an incentive for the medical device industry to make these devices more widely available, enabling good care at lower cost when such devices are substantially equivalent in effectiveness and safety. In turn, availability and awareness of older, off-patent devices could help stimulate such demand.",2023,Endocrinology & Metabolism,0

Textual analysis methods are applied to measure the strength of four types of patent policies and assess patent quality. By conducting panel regression and robustness tests, the study reveals significant variations in the effects of different types of patent policies on various aspects of patents. Moreover, it highlights that solely considering the combination intensity of policies while disregarding their balance would result in a decline in patent quality. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for policymakers aiming to develop policies that effectively enhance patent quality in their respective regions.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Intellectual Property Investment at the International Court of Justice After Certain Iranian Assets,Patent Protection; Intellectual Property Investments; World Court; Assets; Interpretation; CONTINUITY; LAW,"In Certain Iranian Assets, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) acknowledges that the protection of patents is part of the broader remit of a corporate entity with legal personality in international law. The case was not about intellectual property investments, nor was it a case about investment protection in the proper sense of that body of law. However, when the Court, in very light form, mentions the protection of patents, the World Court raises the bar for the dynamics of intellectual property investments in international law. This comment seeks to do two things. Frist, it will map out how the ICJ came to acknowledge the protection of patent rights in corporate entities and secondly, it will set out the parameters in which the ICJ develop its own version of investment protection as such. Certain Iranian Assets is an interesting case since it covers a range of issues with a high rate of declarations, separate opinions, and partial dissent on different matters.

We find that the likelihood of Canadian firms' patenting in both the U.S. and Canada is associated with past patenting experience, firm size, profitability and patent scope. While manufacturing firms in export intensive industries are more likely to patent in both countries, firms in Foreign Direct Investment intensive industries are more likely to patent domestically. Finally, Canadian Intellectual Property Office's role as an International Search Authority under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is associated with an increase in the use of PCT by Canadian firms.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Patenting Strategies on Inhaler Delivery Devices,antitrust law; asthma; COPD; Food and Drug Administration; inhalers; patents; ,"BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma and COPD rely on inhalers to control symptoms. Yet, these products remain expensive, in part because brand-name manufacturers have obtained numerous patents on inhalers, including on their delivery devices. Recent antitrust litigation has raised questions about the boundaries of listing device patents with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), particularly when patents do not claim any active ingredients. RESEARCH QUESTION: How have manufacturers relied on device patents to preserve market exclusivity on brand-name inhalers? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified patents on brand-name inhalers approved for asthma and COPD between 1986 and 2020 using the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). We extracted information about patents from LexisNexis TotalPatent One and Google Patents and searched device patents for mention of active ingredients or other prespecified features linking the patent to the relevant drug. For each inhaler, we determined the duration of protection added by device patents. RESULTS: The FDA approved 53 brand-name inhalers for asthma and COPD from 1986 through 2020, 39 of which had at least one device patent. One hundred thirty-seven distinct device patents were in the final cohort, representing 49% of all patents listed on inhalers. Seventy-seven percent of device patents made no mention of active ingredients or their molecular structures, and 72% made no mention of any relevant prespecified feature connecting the device patent to the drug product. For the 39 brand-name inhalers with one or more device patents listed in the Orange Book, device patents extended the duration of market protection by a median of 5.5 years (interquartile range, 0.0-10.5 years) beyond the last-to-expire nondevice patent. INTERPRETATION: Patent and regulatory reform is needed to promote generic competition and to ensure that patients with asthma and COPD have access to affordable medications.",2023,General & Internal Medicine; Respiratory System,0

We find that the FTDA raised treated firms' operating profits and was followed by a spike in trademark lawsuits and lower entry and exit in affected product markets. Treated firms reduced R&D spending, produced fewer patents and new products, and recalled a higher number of unsafe products. Our results suggest that stronger trademark protection negatively affected innovation and product quality.",2020,Business & Economics,0
THE IMPACT OF PATENTS AND R&D COOPERATION ON R&D INVESTMENTS IN A DIFFERENTIATED GOODS INDUSTRY,research and development; investments; patents; cooperation; differentiated goods; RESEARCH JOINT VENTURES; INNOVATION ACTIVITIES; DEVELOPMENT POLICY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; FIRMS; PRODUCTIVITY; TECHNOLOGY; INCENTIVES; SUBSIDIES; COLLABORATION,"In this paper, we consider the impact of patents and R&D cooperation on R&D investments in the oligopolistic industry with differentiated products. Four types of firms' conduct are investigated: R&D competition without patents, R&D competition with patent protection, R&D cooperation, and the full industry cooperation. The obtained results suggest that patents do not necessarily promote R&D investments due to the existence of so called tournament effects. R&D cooperation stimulates R&D investments, but R&D cooperation provides sufficient incentives to create a full industry cartel. Such a cartel works to the detriment of consumers. Our analysis led us to the conclusion that for a relatively low level of R&D spillovers, the policy-makers should promote R&D competition without patent protection among oligopolistic firms. For a relatively high level of R&D spillovers, R&D cooperation enhances innovation, but the regulator should monitor the market for probable collusion.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Morality: An Important Consideration at the Patent Office,; BIOTECHNOLOGY; UTILITY; MARKET,"Recent developments in biotechnology have opened new avenues not only for research but also for patenting. However, recent United States Supreme Court decisions such as Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics demonstrate the interpretive difficulties these new technologies raise in patent law. Many scholars, for example, have argued that rather than using the product of nature doctrine and focusing on the line between human and natural constructs, the Court in Myriad should have ruled based on the doctrine's policy goal: protecting the basic tools of scientific and technological work. Not doing so has led to doctrinal confusion, decreased patent protection, and increased uncertainty in industry. In addition, recent biotechnological developments also raise increased ethical concerns. These concerns should lead us to reconsider the relationship between patent law and ethics. After reviewing the history of intellectual property protection for biotechnology inventions, this Note considers the policy rationale of promoting useful inventions and proposes implementation of a new procedure for ethical review at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.",2020,Government & Law,0

Households can borrow funds from an imperfect international capital market to finance their investment in R&D firms. We show that the economy can reach a higher growth rate if international capital is more mobile. This result is consistent with recent empirical findings. Moreover, we show that the common growth-enhancing policies, such as patent protection and the R&D subsidies, have an additional negative welfare effect when households can access the international capital market. Accordingly, the optimal patent protection and R&D subsidy should be smaller when the degree of international capital mobility is higher.",2023,Business & Economics,0

Supplementary Protection Certificates in Europe: Clarity at Last?,SPCs; patents; pharmaceuticals; medicines; life sciences; Brexit; ,,2021,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0
SPC squatting,; ,"Supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) for pharmaceutical products are an important complement to patent protection which is often inadequate in commercial terms. SPCs are designed to ensure that originators can amortize their high investments in research and clinical trials. But unlike in the USA, for example, the European SPC is not simply a patent term extension. Rather, it is a unique form of intellectual property right whose subject matter is not the overall patented invention, but the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients of a patented and authorized pharmaceutical product. This link between the basic patent and market authorization has led to many questions of interpretation and Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) rulings since the SPC Regulation was adopted. An issue that has not yet been decided by the CJEU concerns the discrepancy between the ownership of the patent and the marketing authorisation under pharmaceutical law. This scenario, in which a patent proprietor relies on the marketing authorisation of a third party (possibly even a competitor) in said patent proprietor's application for an SPC, is also referred to as SPC squatting. The following article discusses the admissibility of such a practice de lege lata, which also becomes relevant in light of current reform efforts by the legislator.",2024,Government & Law,0

Invention pledges involve the open disclosure of patentable inventions without seeking patent protection, unlike patent pledges for which firms waive patent rights after patenting. Competing theoretical views characterize invention pledges either as low-quality inventions with poor organizational fit or as patentable inventions pledged openly by firms with weak firm-specific patent rights and lead-time advantages. We test these theoretical claims using a novel method that compares the quality of subsequent patents citing IBM invention pledges with similar others. Citing IBM invention pledges is positively correlated with patent quality, inconsistent with theories of adverse selection. IBM patents cite its invention pledges on average two years before others, consistent with private benefits of open disclosure. Cited invention pledges spur follow-on innovation, further highlighting their social benefits. We discuss the generalizability of our results obtained using the sample of cited invention pledges to uncited invention pledges. Overall, our results highlight the tradeoffs firms face between knowledge protection and disclosure and generalize to a small number of other disclosing firms.",2024,Engineering; Business & Economics,0
Patent protection in the laws of Iran and the emphasis of European Union on the TRIPS agreement,patent rights; TRIPS Agreement; comparative analysis; Iranian laws; European Union; ,"The patent right and the inventor's exploitation of his own thought and initiative represent a financial right which can be traded. However, as this right is immaterial and intangible, ownership cannot be claimed merely by possessing it physically. Instead, the rightful owner should be the first individual who achieved it through hard work and effort, enabling them to benefit from it exclusively and prevent imitators from utilizing the inventor's efforts freely and without exertion. Registering a patent in the inventor's name becomes crucial as it serves as proof that the holder is the original person who successfully conceived the invention, establishing their rightful ownership. Therefore, patents and other intangible assets play a vital role in establishing the ownership of inventors. The purpose of this article is to familiarize inventors with patent procedures and emphasize the importance of registering their patents to ensure protection. It also reviews and studies the patent protection systems in the laws of Iran and the European Union. The research concludes that in order to accept the TRIPS agreement and join the World Trade Organization, considerable efforts are required, which include aligning domestic laws concerning inventions with international regulations, such as those of the World Trade Organization.

The legal protection of new plant varieties in Algerian and American system,Algerian law; American legislation; innovation; legal protection-property right; new plant variety; patent; plant; ,"The importance of plants in almost all fields yields for a continuous international effort to determine the protection of innovations in plants, especially with the tendency of countries to make huge investments in this area. Though, most of the world's countries agreed to set-up effective protection for new plant varieties, they differ over the type and nature of proper legal protection. This discrepancy in international positions on legal protection frameworks leads the researchers to investigate the most appropriate legal adaptations of innovative new plant varieties; are they inventions or an independent intellectual property right? And what are the suitable ways to protect it? Thereby, a comparative analysis of the national texts with some foreign legislation has been conducted. The study structure is twofold. The first section dealt with the legal protection of plant varieties within an independent legal system: a study in the Algerian law, while the second one presented the possibility of protecting a new plant variety under a patent: a study in the American legislation. The results showed that the adoption of a patent protection system is of great importance.

Benchmarking US university patent value and commercialization efforts: A new approach,University patents; Patent value; Patent licensing; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; PROPERTY; MARKET; PROTECTION; CITATIONS; SHADOW; GROWTH,"Despite the economic significance of patented university research, it is difficult to measure the economic value of academic patented inventions and observe the extent to which universities are able to capture such value through patent licensing. Moving beyond assessing commercialization performance by simple statistics, we propose a new approach to benchmarking university patents and commercialization performance based on comparative corporate patent value. Our procedure involves matching university patents to patents with similar patent characteristics granted to public corporations, then estimating the potential value of these university patents by stock market reactions to grants of the matched corporate patents. These estimated values of university patents can significantly explain the technology-level income from licensing by a leading US research university and the annual licensing income of the member universities of the Association of University Technology Managers' (AUTM). We find that AUTM universities realize an average of 16% of the estimated value of matched corporate patents. We also investigate correlates of university-level potential patent value and suggest avenues for future research.",2021,Business & Economics,0

Utilizing panel data from 284 prefecture-level cities from 2005 to 2021, the spatial Durbin model is employed to analyze the spatial correlation and determinants of IP protection. Findings reveal a notable positive spatial dependence and spillover effects of IP protection. The spatial dependence is more pronounced between geographically adjacent cities than those with close economic ties. Moreover, patent output and the presence of national IP demonstration cities significantly bolster IP protection levels, underscoring the importance of both quality and a balanced quantity of patents. The impact of these factors varies with regional and urban scale heterogeneity, with more pronounced effects in eastern and larger cities. This research underscores the positive spatial effects of IP protection and its role in enhancing regional innovation capabilities, fostering high-quality economic development, and supporting innovation-driven strategies, offering valuable theoretical and practical insights.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Foreign patents for the technology transfer from laboratories of US federal agencies,Invention licenses; Patents; Technology transfer; Federal laboratories; Federal agencies; ,"This paper documents the importance of foreign patents for the technology transfer of inventions created in the laboratories of the U.S. federal agencies. First, we describe the patent portfolios of the 11 federal agencies with 98 percent of the research performed within the laboratories of all U.S. federal agencies. Second, we estimate the distributed lag function showing the effects on license revenue of an agency's history of patent applications for inventions granted U.S. patents. The estimation shows that those effects depend on whether the agency also obtained foreign patent protection for its inventions. Third, we estimate a dynamic panel data model of license revenues as a function of the history of applications and granted patents. The evidence supports the view that an agency that obtains U.S. patents for its technologies but does not obtain foreign patent protection disadvantages the corporations that license the agency's technologies and then face international competition from firms that copy those technologies and compete with lower costs because they do not incur full development costs or pay royalties for licensing the technologies. An increase in foreign patents would increase the willingness of companies to undertake the development costs necessary to have successful commercial products, and technology transfer-with more remuneration to U.S. taxpayers via license royalties-of inventions from the laboratories of U.S. federal agencies would increase.",2022,Engineering; Business & Economics,0

Toward this end, we focus on the passage of the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA), which mandated public disclosure of patent applications. Theoretically, technology disclosure enables CVCs to better evaluate startups and thus, could increase the likelihood of investment relations. Conversely, such disclosure may already satisfy the technology-acquisition objectives of CVCs, reducing CVCs willingness to form an investment relation after disclosure. Our empirical analysis finds that patent disclosure through AIPA increased the likelihood of receiving CVC investments for startups-specifically in industries where patents have higher information significance. We provide evidence that the observed pattern is mainly driven by a reduction of information constraints regarding startups with patent applications. Managerial Summary Receiving corporate venture capital (CVC) funding is an important success factor for technology startups. Would disclosure of a startup's innovation increase or decrease its chance of receiving CVC funding? On the one hand, disclosure by startups would reduce uncertainty and search costs for CVC investors, which could increase the chance of CVC funding. On the other hand, such a disclosure would reveal the startups' technology to the corporations, which would in turn reduce corporate incentive to use funding as awindow to the startup's technology. Thus, disclosure could also reduce the chance of CVC funding of startups. In this paper, we study the above issue by examining the case of the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA), which mandated public disclosure of patent applications. Our results suggest that innovation disclosure significantly improves the likelihood of CVC funding of startups.",2021,Business & Economics,0

Our empirical analysis comprises 555 patents with applications filed between 1999 and 2002. The term of these patents either ended in 2018 or lapsed due to non-payment of the renewal fee. We model the renewal decision of patentee as ordered probit where patent renewal fee increases with the age of the patent. Variables, such as patent family size, technological scope, number of inventors and grant lag, are used as explanatory variables in the corresponding regression. Hence, this paper combines the patentee's renewal decision along with patents' characteristics and renewal cost schedule to estimate the initial rent distribution.

This study uses strategic emerging industries (SEIs) that are important for the future development of the world as examples and constructs a novel dataset of Chinese SEI patents abroad (1993-2017) to explore the spatiotemporal evolution and determinants of the geography of these patents. Our results show that the number of Chinese SEI patents abroad is growing rapidly, and the new-generation information technology industry is increasingly dominating, accounting for approximately 50% of all SEI patents abroad. Chinese SEI patents abroad are highly concentrated in the United States, Western Europe, and East Asia, and their influence is gradually spreading from African countries to developed countries. The host country's intellectual property rights (IPR) protection level, technology market size and imitation risk have significant positive effects on Chinese SEI patents abroad, while the host country's high-tech product market size and competition risk have negative effects on Chinese patents abroad.

However, a high level of remanufacturing design will increase design costs for manufacturers, while also reducing the cost for remanufacturers. Moreover, manufacturers usually use patent barriers to restrict the development of remanufacturers. The main aims of this study were to explore how manufacturers and remanufacturers can benefit each other, taking into account patent protection and carbon emissions. Firstly, we adopted game theory to establish four decision-making models of the manufacturer and remanufacturer regarding DfR. Secondly, we designed a cost-sharing contract for DfR based on the decentralized decision-making model to coordinate a CLSC. The results of this study showed that under the patent-protected market environment, DfR increased the manufacturer's profit but did not necessarily promote the remanufacturer's profit growth. A cost-sharing contract can effectively achieve improvements in the presence of DfR, increase profits for both parties, and improve the economic and environmental benefits of the CLSC.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics,0

Herein, we describe an analysis of more than 26 000 patent publications from 2007-2017 related to the field of entomology. These patents were divided among 8000 patent assignees; however, only 5% of the assignees had >= 10 patents. Corporations accounted for the largest share of patents (59%), with individuals (20%), academic institutions (17%) and government organizations (4%) making up the remaining segments. From 2007-2017 the number of entomological patents increased by 400%, with the largest number being from China. However, unlike patents from Europe, Japan or the US, which target a range of countries, the Chinese patents almost exclusively focus on China. Among the array of subjects covered are transgenic insects and plants, repellents, recombinant insect cells, with the highest proportion of patents focused on insecticides (39%), followed by insecticide mixtures (27%) and formulations (21%). The top 30 patent assignees included companies/institutions from China (18), Europe (3), Japan (6) and the US (3). Among the top 12 entities, IP from the US assignees was distributed across insecticides, mixtures and insecticidal traits while those from China were more focused on mixtures. However, given expanding IP numbers from China it is expected that in the future there will be a greater impact on new insecticides and related technologies.

However, there is little specific guidance documented the link between patent-based measures and patent collateral. Therefore, the purpose of this article attempts to investigate how patent-based measures and patents used as collateral are related. This article employed eight frequently used patent-based measures categorized into three dimensions, i.e., knowledge flow, technological diversity, and legal protection, to analyze which factors increase patent collateral likelihood and patent collateral speed. The results of this article shows that reference count, times cited count, originality index, generality index, claim count, and family size all increase patent collateral likelihood. On the other hand, reference count, nonpatent reference count, originality index, claim count, and family size accelerate patent collateral speed.",2022,Business & Economics; Engineering,0
PABC: A Patent Application System Based on Blockchain,Patent; blockchain; smart contract; Hyperledger fabric; ,"Under the protection of the patent system, an inventor can patent his or her invention, to make an economic profit from the patent, thus encouraging further invention. However, a patent is territorial. To get an international patent, the invention should be patented several times in all target patent offices, even with the help of international conventions like PCT, leading to inefficiency, expensiveness, and uncertainty. Therefore, we construct an international patent application system based on a permissioned blockchain named PABC. Patent applications can be approved or rejected without relying on one patent office. Each patent office in a country or region manages a peer node of the system, reaching agreements of all the applications. First, we build the model of the system and detail the three-layer architecture of PABC Core. Then, we implement PABC on a permissioned blockchain platform - Hyperledger Fabric. In addition, experiments about its throughput, transaction latency, and failure rate were carried out. The results show that PABC can meet current needs.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,0
TRIPS AGREEMENT AND MALAYSIAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS: DATA EXCLUSIVITY v PATENT,Intellectual property; protection mechanism; patent; data exclusivity; TRIPS agreement; INFORMATION; ACCESS,"This study analyses the provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement with respect to the various intellectual property protection mechanisms. The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Malaysia is a TRIPS compliance country and have established intellectual property laws including the incorporation of data exclusivity laws. This study also illustrates that data exclusivity and patent are two different intellectual property protection mechanisms required under the TRIPS Agreement. Moreover, this study clarifies the misconception that data exclusivity and patents are somehow related; such that data exclusivity is an extension of patent rights and that it is often regarded as a TRIPS-plus provision. The study is conducted based on qualitative research, predicated on primary sources such as the TRIPS Agreement and the various laws with respect to intellectual property in Malaysia. It is further supported by secondary sources from journals and information provided on relevant authorities' websites. The results of the study show that Malaysia is a TRIPS compliance country and that data exclusivity is an intellectual property protection mechanism that is established pursuant to Article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement. Hence, this study concludes that member countries of the TRIPS Agreement that have established data exclusivity protection mechanism to protect undisclosed data submitted to their respective authorities for the purpose of marketing approval of pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical products, including Malaysia, are indeed in compliance with the obligation set under Article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement.",2020,Government & Law,0

Towards a More Orderly Application of Proportionality to Patent Injunctions in the European Union,Proportionality; Injunctive relief; Permanent injunctions; Abuse of rights; Equity; Patent assertion entities; Complex products; HOLDUP,"The intensity of IP protection has traditionally been determined by assessing the criteria that need to be satisfied for the protection to be granted, as well as the scope of rights and limitations of those rights. The enforcement stage and the remedies available to right holders have for long been, if not neglected, then certainly treated with lesser attention. The rise of aggressive litigation strategies, especially in the field of patents, has brought the enforcement stage to the forefront of the discussion about the proper level of IP protection in general and patent law in particular. Injunctions provide particularly strong leverage at the enforcement stage, allowing patentees in some cases to obtain royalties that exceed the value of the protected inventions. The principle of proportionality can play an important role as a check on excessive litigation strategies by patentees. Flexibility, however, comes at the price of uncertainty and unpredictability as to the outcome of patent disputes. Therefore, it is crucial to apply proportionality in an orderly and structured manner. For that purpose, the article identifies a set of factors that may be helpful in applying proportionality in patent disputes. That set of factors is well grounded in the traditions of the laws of the EU Member States.",2022,Government & Law,0
Global patent statistical analysis for drug testing technology,Drug detection; patent statistics; patent analysis; development trend; ,"BACKGROUND: In recent decades, illicit drug testing has become a high priority area in law enforcement and forensic analysis. OBJECTIVE: Since patents are the largest source of technical information in the world, patent database analysis for illicit drug testing is extremely important to effectively promote the development and protection of the related intellectual property rights. METHODS: In the present study, we first retrieve a database of 1732 drug detection patents using keywords and logical expressions related to the title, abstract, and claims, and subsequently discuss the current global patent statistics in detail. RESULTS: The relevant patent information is presented, including patent application quantity, filing country, ownership, and technical field. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we summarize the current development trend in drug testing and propose several suggestions focused on the bottleneck of analytical techniques.",2021,Health Care Sciences & Services; Engineering,0
Patent term extensions and commercialization lags in the pharmaceutical industry: A growth-theoretic analysis,Commercialization lags; Patent term extensions; Pharmaceutical R&D; Economic growth; Social welfare; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; BLOCKING PATENTS; GENERIC COMPETITION; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; MODEL; POLICY; LENGTH,"Due to the lags in commercialization, the effective life of a patent is generally less than its stat-utory term. We introduce commercialization lags into the Schumpeterian growth model and explore the effects of patent term extensions on pharmaceutical R&D and social welfare. Our results show that extending patent terms stimulates the consumption of homogeneous goods but generates an ambiguous effect on the consumption of pharmaceuticals. When patent extensions have an inverted-U effect on social welfare, the optimal patent extension increases with the length of commercialization lags but decreases with the input intensity of commercialization lags. Finally, we calibrate the model and find that increasing patent breadth reduces the optimal patent extension.",2023,Business & Economics,0
UNCREATIVE DESIGNS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; COPYRIGHT; CREATIVITY; LAW; HISTORY; FEIST,"It is often said that the standards for patent protection are higher than the standards for copyright protection. Specifically, commentators assert that the copyright requirement of originality is easier to satisfy than the patent requirements of novelty and nonobviousness. And yet, the USPTO regularly grants patents for designs that fall below the low standard of copyright originality set by the Supreme Court in Feist v. Rural. Some may suggest that the existence of these sub-Feist design patents is a result of the USPTO abandoning its duty to scrutinize design patent applications. Or they may suggest that it is a result of the Federal Circuit making it more difficult to invalidate designs as anticipated or obvious. This Article argues that sub-Feist designs exist because the standard for originality (at least, in the sense of minimal creativity) is not really lower than novelty or nonobviousness-it's just different. This has implications for how we think about the law and theory of copyright and patents as well as specific implications for design patent law and practice. Importantly, this suggests that we should take the word original-which is also an explicit statutory requirement for design patents-seriously. We should not assume that a design that qualifies, under the Patent Act, as novel and nonobvious is also original under the Feist standard. And if, as the Supreme Court has held, the Feist originality standard is a requirement of the Progress Clause, we should not let applicants use design patents to evade that requirement",2024,Government & Law,0
Market valuation of international patenting using a real option approach: the moderating role of uncertainty,International patenting; Tobin's q market value model; uncertainty; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT; STRATEGIES; IMPACT; FIRMS; IDEAS,"The article assesses the option value embedded in a firm's patent assets relying on the Tobin's q market value model. In particular, novel empirical evidence on the market valuation of patent strategies is provided with regard to the universe of R&D reporting firms in France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K. The international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty are found to enhance the option value effect significantly more than IP protection pursued through a national patenting strategy. Furthermore, the paper reports that conditions of uncertainty regarding the firm and the market positively moderate the relative impact of the international patent application on market value and that the two sources of uncertainty mutually reinforce the moderating effect. These extended findings with uncertainty are in line with the real option theoretical framework, claiming that the bigger the uncertainty in the decision-making process, the larger the real option value effect. The paper concludes by discussing some relevant managerial implications, that take into the account not only the prosecution and maintenance costs of a firm's IP protection strategy but also the relative flexibility in the decision-making process.",2024,Business & Economics,0

Corporate strategies to protect software innovation: Empirical evidences from South Korea,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION; PATENTS; MECHANISMS; INDUSTRY; RIGHTS,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are blind spots in decision making to protect innovation by examining how formal and informal protection systems affect software innovation. We empirically compared the innovation activities of 218 software companies with 261 information and communication technology (ICT) manufacturing companies in South Korea. Our results confirm that formal protection system alone is insufficient to protect software innovation, but its effect may vary depending on the corporate size. While, combination of patent with complicated designs is effective. More sophisticated policy to complement informal protections for small and medium-sized enterprises with less than 100 employees is needed.",2024,Business & Economics,0
An investigation into the relationship between quality and commercialisation channel of university patents,Patent commercialisation channel; patent quality; selling; licensing; university patent; EXTERNAL TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; MARKET; FIRMS; INNOVATION; IDEAS; PERFORMANCE; PROTECTION; RENEWAL; IMPACT,"We investigate how patent quality is correlated with different commercialisation channels for university patents. A dataset of 2052 university patents, including the market price of patents, is employed for the empirical analysis. We find that patents with more claims are less likely to be sold but more likely to be licensed, meaning that the decision of patent license is focused more on the patent's legal stability. Furthermore, patents with more IPC classes and broader scope are more likely to be sold, meaning that the decision of patent selling is focused more on the potential of the patent to be used in different areas. The price of sold patents is positively correlated with the number of claims, number of IPC classes, scope, and family size, whereas the price of licensed patents is positively correlated with the forward citations they receive and family size. Considering the time effect of patent grants and patent commercialisation, pre-grant patents are more likely to be commercialised by selling them at a price higher than granted patents, and patents with more claims tend to be commercialised for a shorter duration.",2024,Business & Economics,0

In 2004, the European Patent Office (EPO) made the unique move to systematically extend its prior art database by including documents shared among members of standard-setting organisations, but not made available to the general audience. This paper investigates the effects of this policy change. We find that it worked thanks to a significant reduction in granting rates rather than reducing the scope of granted patents. Our study demonstrates how a targeted approach can improve the quality of the patent granting process.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Antitrust Enforcement in the Pharmaceutical Industry: Analyzing Patents Under the Rule of Reason,; ,"American consumers and lawmakers across the political spectrum agree that prescription drug prices are far too high. This Note identifies an antitrust cause of action that could drastically reduce the prices of the most expensive prescription drugs. Under section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (Section 1), all agreements that unreasonably restrain trade are illegal. Patents are agreements between inventors and the public, and under antitrust rule of reason analysis, some patents, i.e., patents covering lifesaving medicines for which there are no close substitutes, may unreasonably restrain trade and therefore violate Section 1. The rule of reason analysis in this Note weighs the long-term economic benefits of robust patent protection against the relatively short-term economic inefficiencies of patent protection. While the benefits of patents almost always outweigh the harms, patents on lifesaving medicines for which there are no close substitutes are economically unique. Demand for these medicines remains immense, regardless of how high prices climb, because patients need them to live. Prices soar, sometimes to millions of dollars per dose, and the public ultimately shoulders the cost. This Note argues that under Section 1 rule of reason analysis, the patents that enable these extraordinarily high prices may unreasonably restrain trade. For now, the antitrust action proposed in this Note is likely unavailable under Supreme Court precedents that appear to immunize patents from antitrust scrutiny. This Note suggests amendments to federal law that would abrogate patents' implicit antitrust immunity and, where a Section 1 violation is proven, provide for compulsory patent licensing to generic drugmakers for a reasonable royalty. These amendments could save Americans billions annually on prescription drugs while preserving pharmaceutical companies' incentives to develop new medicines.",2024,Government & Law,0
SCALPELS OVER SLEDGEHAMMERS: SAVING DIAGNOSTIC PATENTS THROUGH JUDICIAL INTERVENTION RATHER THAN LEGISLATIVE OVERRIDE,; ,"Diagnostic tests have become indispensable in the rapidly growing field known as precision medicine. Precision medicine tailors treatments to individual patients by using these diagnostic tests to identify how a patient may respond to different therapies. Diagnostics are expensive to develop but show promise in optimizing patient treatment and creating healthcare savings. Even as the medical community has heralded precision medicine as the way of the future, the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit have handed down a dizzying array of decisions regarding attempts to patent diagnostics and precision medicine techniques. Subsequently, courts have struggled to apply the test for patent eligibility, leaving the interpretation of patentable subject matter under 101 of the Patent Act in a state of chaos. This chaos has created concerns that diagnostics may be unpatentable, providing minimal protection or incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in their development. To rectify this confusion, legislators have proposed overhauling the longstanding Patent Act and rewriting the patent-eligibility statute altogether. This Note argues that these legislative attempts are misguided. Though some remedy for the current patent-eligibility test is required, that solution should come from the courts, not the legislature. Courts can use a dynamic and nuanced common law approach to create a standard that can adapt to the continuously evolving technologies and scientific advancements that seek patent protection. A legislative override, on the other hand, could leave the patent statute in as much chaos as before. A judicial refinement of the patent-eligibility test would allow for the patenting of meritorious diagnostics, providing the necessary innovation incentives for their continued development.",2021,Government & Law,0

How innovating firms manage knowledge leakage: A natural experiment on the threat of worker departure,innovation strategy; knowlege management; out-of-state noncompetes; patents; worker mobility; TRADE SECRETS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; EMPLOYEE MOBILITY; PATENTS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; ENFORCEABILITY; HETEROGENEITY; COMPENSATION; DISCLOSURE; AGREEMENTS,"Research Summary Knowledge protection strategies are crucial to innovating firms facing the risk of knowledge leakage. We examine the threat of worker departure as a key mechanism through which firms choose between patents and secrecy. We exploit a 1998 California court decision that ruled out-of-state noncompetes were not enforceable in California, thereby creating a loophole limiting non-California firms in their enforcement of noncompetes against their workers. When facing a higher threat of worker departure, firms strategically increased patent filings, exchanging legal protection for public disclosure of the invention. These effects were magnified for large-sized firms and for those in complex and fast-growing industries. Further mechanism tests on the possession of trade secrets, inventor migration, saliency of the decision, and independent inventors support our theoretical account. Managerial Summary Innovating firms may use patents or secrecy, among other mechanisms, to protect their knowledge from leakage. How do firms make this important strategic choice? By using a natural experiment arising from a 1998 California court decision, we show the risk of worker departure can be a key driver. The decision significantly increased the risk of workers departing non-California firms. Our findings show that, in response to the heightened risk, affected firms increasingly relied on patents, seeking legal protection although it meant public disclosure of the invention. The effects were greater for large-sized firms and for those in complex and fast-growing industries. We encourage managers to consider worker mobility and, more broadly, legal environments that govern labor market conditions when formulating knowledge protection strategies.",2022,Business & Economics,0
The Effect of TRIPS Implementation on Indian Patent Law: A Pharmaceutical Industry Perspective: With Special Reference to Healthcare Industry,Pharmaceutical; Patent Law; IPR; Healthcare Industry; Legal Scenario and Policies; ,"The Pharmaceutical Policy, 2002 of the Government of India emphasized upon diluting drug price control by suggesting criteria for price control that will reduce the basket of price control to a bunch of irrelevant or so drugs. The kinds of drugs that would be left under price control are mostly irrelevant to public health. The World Trade Organization (WTO) enacted the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to provide reasonable standards of protection for each of its Member Countries. The TRIPS Agreement is a basic standards agreement that gives Members the option to offer more comprehensive intellectual property protection if they so choose. Members are free to choose how to apply the Agreement's provisions in accordance with their respective legal framework and practices. Since India joined the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the country's patent system has experienced substantial modifications. Product patent protection was made mandatory for developing nations in 1995. The TRIPS Agreement establishes basic requirements for patent protection, and when it was put into effect, the economic businesses underwent a significant transformation. Since its creation, the World Trade Organization's (WTO) member countries' intellectual property (IP) regime has changed and modified.

Although major countries have promoted pro-patent policies, there are significant differences in patent infringement awards among jurisdictions. This article comparatively analyzes determinants of patent infringement awards in the US, Japan, and China using 880 court decisions between 2000 and 2014. We find that Japan's judges attach more weight to a litigated patent's technological importance, whereas judges in the US and China prioritize its private economic value. Besides, damages ruled by US juries are almost unpredictable, while judges provide the most predictable decisions. We also find that the jury system can explain both the variation in the US patent infringement awards and the difference with awards in Japan, but the treble damage system can only explain the former. These results provide novel empirical evidence for public policy debates on patent protection and practical insights for intellectual property professionals.",2020,Information Science & Library Science,0

It proposes that patents make inventions both excludable and alienable, in contrast to secrecy which only makes them excludable. A survival analysis finds that 10% higher complexity of patent descriptions is associated with 9% higher patent transfer hazard. This suggests that inventors more often patent complex inventions for the alienability motive - as opposed to the excludability motive. Small inventors transfer their patents less likely, but they do so sooner than other inventors. This suggests that patents enable an exchange of inventions that would otherwise be kept secret, but small inventors may not benefit from this function disproportionately more than others. These findings have implications for the conceptualization of innovation.",2023,Business & Economics,0
COPYRIGHT AND PATENT PROTECTION OF CLOuD STORAGE SOFTWARE IN THE BRICS MEMBER STATES,copyright; intellectual property; BRICS; Russia; China; India; Brazil; South Africa; ,"In the BRICS Member States, serious attention is paid to Information Technology develop-ment in terms of both technology and law. These countries are at the forefront in the development of the digital economy and digital innovations. Cloud storage software is an important element in this sector and is intensively applied in civil law transactions. The processes of approval, storage and sorting of documents are being automated on the basis of the relevant computer programs. This helps companies and government agencies to systemize their operations. At present, the most pressing issues are those related to copyright and copyright holders of computer programs since software code may be copied, even illegally or unconscientiously, and used as the basis for another software product. Cloud storage software is copyright-protected, but, depending on the scope of its use, additional patent protection may be required. Given the rapid development of the IT sector, a software product may be one of the components in an invention subject to patenting. The article focuses on the relationship between copyright and patent protection of software and offers a comparison of the approaches taken by the BRICS countries.

Reconsidering Conflicts over Gene Patents in View of Taiwan Patent Law,gene patent; compulsory license; Myriad; research exemption; Taiwan Patent Act; patient access; patent eligibility; ,"This article discusses the legal and policy issues arising out of gene patents in light of the United States Supreme Court's Myriad decision. There are alternatives to an outright ban on all gene patents. This article proposes recommendations to accommodate the competing interests of patient access to beneficial technologies and gene patenting. In order to balance the competing interests of encouraging innovation while making gene-based medical treatment more accessible, a research exemption from patent infringement and compulsory licensing of a gene patent is suggested by referring to the Taiwan Patent Act. These solutions would ensure scientists and other groups the opportunity to use gene-related patents for the public interest or noncommercial purposes. The research exemption enables research on patented genes without the risk of being held liable for infringement, thereby promoting further advancement in the gene-related industry. The framework of a compulsory license ensures patient access to genetic treatment. These solutions, on the one hand, solve primary concerns surrounding gene patents, and on the other hand, maintain gene patent protection and the incentives needed to promote the progress of gene-related technologies.",2020,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0
Patenting Genetic Information,; INNOVATION; AMPLIFICATION; BIOLOGICS; ECONOMICS; INDUSTRY; THERAPY; HISTORY; GENOME; IMPACT; PRICE,"The U.S. biotechnology industry got its start and grew to maturity over roughly three decades, beginning in the 1980s. During this period genes were patentable, and many gene patents were granted. University researchers performed basic research- often funded by the government-and then patented the genes they discovered with the encouragement of the Bayh-Dole Act, which sought to encourage practical applications of basic research by allowing patents on federally funded inventions and discoveries. At that time, when a researcher discovered the function of a gene, she could patent it such that no one else could work with that gene in the laboratory without a license. She had no right, however, to control genes in nature, including in human bodies. Universities licensed their researchers' patents to industry, which brought in significant revenue for further research. University researchers also used gene patents as the basis for obtaining funding for start-up enterprises spun out of university labs. It was in this environment that many of today's biotechnology companies started. In 2013, the Supreme Court held that naturally occurring genes could no longer be patented. This followed a 2012 decision that disallowed patents on many diagnostic processes. These decisions significantly changed the intellectual property protections in the biotechnology industry. Nevertheless, the industry has continued to grow and thrive. This Article investigates two questions. First, if some form of exclusive rights still applied to genes, would the biotech industry be even more robust, with more new entrants in addition to thriving, well-established companies? Second, does the current lack of protection for gene discoveries incentivize keeping such discoveries secret for the many years that it can take to develop a therapeutic based thereon-to the detriment of patients who could benefit from knowledge of the genetic associations, even before a treatment is developed? The Article concludes by analyzing what protection for discovering genetic associations, if any, will most increase social welfare.",2023,Government & Law,0

"Private and social functions of patents: Innovation, markets, and new firms",; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; INCENTIVES; SPILLOVERS; STRATEGIES; PROTECTION; RIGHTS,"This article provides a review of the private and social functions of patents using data and evidence from the economic and management literature. While patents provide incentives to invent by providing private protection to appropriate the returns on inventions, they also have broader effects. For example, in this paper we focus on the fact that they provide signals about the value of new firms, disclose information about the invention, and encourage the exchange of inventions and ideas in markets for technology. In order to better understand the relative importance of the implications of patents, patent agencies and stakeholders should invest to a greater extent in data collections or in creating the conditions for research designs and experiments that nail down causal effects and mechanisms. Available data are not created with these identification strategies in mind, which limits the questions that scholars can ask. Systematic studies that identify different effects of patents can provide the basis for rigorous evidence-based management and policy about patents. This would imply a wider shift from a world in which managerial and policy analysis is distinct from practice, to a world in which analysis and implementation are increasingly co-produced, and there is greater integration between them.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Patent characteristics for leishmaniasis treatment as a basis for freedom-to-operate analysis,Leishmaniasis therapy; Intellectual property right; Patent; Claim; Bolar exemption; ,"Among the main zoonoses with the highest morbidity burden is leishmaniasis. The parasite of the genus Leishmania is its etiological agent. There are three forms of the disease: cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral. Pentavalent antimonial drugs are used for leishmaniasis treatment, however toxic side effects and parasite resistance have been detected. Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) protect inventions that promote benefits to society, and patents are particularly notable for preserving advancements in biotechnology. To introduce innovative technologies, it is necessary to analyze the elements and processes involved in the development of products that may be protected by IPRs. This process consists of product deconstruction into its elements for an intellectual property analysis to contemplate commercial viability, and to determine strategies to avoid infringing third party rights (Freedom-to-Operate approach). In this project, a sample of patents protecting treatments directed against leishmaniasis were evaluated in order to know their characteristics, and to establish useful elements for Freedom-to-operate strategies. Open access patent databases were used (The Lens, Google patents, Patentscope, among others), and relevant characteristics such as claims, owners, technology protection region, or year of application for protection were determined. The sample obtained includes patents from 1967 to 2023. The majority of patents were found to be located in countries such as Brazil or the United States, and described developments focused on compounds derived from chemical synthesis, polypeptides, extracts, antigens, or structural components of the parasite. There are several patents that have already expired and whose information can be freely used. The Bolar exemption would allow the use of information from these patents for regulatory compliance purposes.

The patent buyout price for human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine and the ratio of R&D costs to the patent value,; ,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for almost all of the 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer and approximately 311,000 deaths per year. HPV vaccination is an integral component of the World Health Organization's (WHO) global strategy to fight the disease. However, high vaccine prices enforced through patent protection are limiting vaccine expansion, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. By limiting market power, patent buy-outs could reduce vaccine prices and raise HPV vaccination rates while keeping innovation incentives. We estimate the global patent buyout price as the present discounted value (PDV) of the future profit stream over the remaining patent length for Merck's HPV vaccines (Gardasil-4 and 9), which hold 87% of the global HPV vaccine market, in the range of US$ 15.6-27.7 billion (in 2018 US$). The estimated PDV of the profit stream since market introduction amounts to US$ 17.8-42.8 billion and the estimated R&D cost to US$ 1.05-1.21 billion. Thus, we arrive at a ratio of R&D costs to the patent value of the order of 2.5-6.8%.

A Feasible Pathway for Open Access to Human Embryonic Stem Cell Patents-With China's Open License for Patent as the Entry Point,Human embryonic stem cell (hESC); open license for patent; open access; patent; China; PATENTABILITY,"China has entered the second stage on how to give full play to the value of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) patents, and the key to the issue is the open license instead of setting up the patent thicket. China has added the open license for patent to its patent law and multiple provincial-level administrative regions, including Beijing and Shanghai, have successively carried out open license pilot programs and achieved phased achievements. China's bold innovation in the open license for patent may have a positive impact on promoting the open access of hESC patents. From the perspective of patentees, it provides policy incentives and enhances the protection of rights. In terms of licensees, it reasonably determines the license fee and safeguards stable contract validity. From the higher strategic level, China's open license for patent can provide a beneficial model for various countries of open access of hESC patents.",2024,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0
Empirical insights into industrial policy's influence on phytoprotection innovation,intelligent phytoprotection; industrial policy; patent; DID; empirical view; ,"Intelligent Phytoprotection is an important direction for the modern development of plant protection related disciplines, and its essence is the innovative application of new generation information technology industry, high-end equipment manufacturing industry, and digital industry related technologies in the traditional plant protection field. This article first identifies 224 International Patent Classification (IPC) Main groups in the field of intelligent phytoprotection technology based on the International Patent Classification System. And then combines with China's industrial policy practice, we explore the impact of industrial policy on the application number of invention patents in the field of intelligent phytoprotection technology using the Difference-in-difference (DID) method and the Synthetic DID method. The study results showed that the implementation of industrial policy can significantly promote the patent application activities in the intelligent phytoprotection treatment group, with an average increase of 517 invention patent applications compared to the control group that is not affected by the policy. The research conclusion of this article suggests that for countries and regions, industrial policies are an important tool for promoting the innovation and development of intelligent phytoprotection related technologies.",2023,Plant Sciences,0
Quali-quantitative synthesis of the global scenario of patent families about leprosy,Leprosy and patent; ,"The work presents the analysis and synthesis of patent families about leprosy worldwide in the last 20 years. Three technological aspects were defined for the study of both portfolios, thus defined: diagnostic, drug/treatment and vaccine. Three thousand and three hundred twenty-three (3323) patent families were identified (790 for diagnostic, 1515 for drug and 1018 for vaccine). Fifty-eight (58) patent holders were identified and analyzed, with the most expressive portfolio of patent families, distributed in 13 countries. For the recovery of patent families, the ORBIT Intelligence (R) system from QUESTEL (R) was used. Using quantitative and qualitative analysis and synthesis, the patterns of five strategic indicators on the global patent scenario about leprosy were observed, namely: holders of patent families; the years of filing for unionist priority for patent families; countries of unionist priority for patent families; the legal status of filed patent families; and the legal status of patent families by country of protection. It is suggested that new public policies be created to encourage synergy between patent families and the social determinants of neglected populations, in order to induce a safe path to technological independence and better performance in the fight against leprosy in the Brazil.",2021,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",0
Patents on Environmental Technologies and Environmental Sustainability in Spain,patents; environmental innovations; sustainability; carbon emissions; Spain; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; CO2 EMISSIONS; INNOVATION; TRADE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT,"Through an in-depth evaluation of the potential effectiveness of intellectual property protection on environmental technologies, the aim of the present research is to investigate the effect of patents on environmental innovation, energy use, GDP, and trade openness on environmental deregulation in Spain using nonlinear ARDL techniques. Specifically, the study findings indicate that patents on environmental technologies enhance environ-mental sustainability in Spain, as evidenced by the novel results from the nonlinear ARDL. Secondly, our study reveals that Spain's growing economy degrades the quality of the environment. Based on the findings of the study, positive changes in trade openness could have positive effects on Spain's environmental sustainability, suggesting that better productivity, more international trade, and increased economic openness could facilitate an improvement in Spain's environmental impact. Lastly, this study provides evidence demonstrating that Spain's environmental quality could suffer due to excessive energy consumption. In the light of this study's policy recommendations, the policymakers and the Spanish government should encourage collaboration between private and public partnerships on environmental technologies to address global climate change or regional pollution. It is necessary for research and development to contribute to the development of technological progress in the Spanish energy sector; however, promoting patenting should be prioritized. By expanding patent protection, eco-friendly technologies that can combat carbon emissions can be developed swiftly in Spain, which will enable life to be more sustainable by lowering the use of energy and resources. A strong patent protection sys-tem will foster environmentally-friendly technologies and economic development while reducing CO2 emissions in Spain.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
DO PATENTS DRIVE INVESTMENT IN SOFTWARE?,; LEGAL PROTECTION; INNOVATION; DESIGNS; TROLLS; START,"the wake of a quartet of Supreme Court decisions which disrupted decades of settled law, the doctrine of patentable subject matter is in turmoil. Scholars, commentators, and jurists continue to disagree sharply over which kinds of invention should be patentable. In this debate, no technology has been more controversial than software. Advocates of software patents contend that denying protection would stymie innovation in a vital industry; skeptics argue that patents are a poor fit for software, and that the social costs of patents outweigh any plausible benefits. At the core of this disagreement is a basic problem: the debate is predicated on various claims about how and whether patents incentivize innovation, but like much of patent law, these claims rest on meager empirical foundations. This Article bolsters these foundations by testing one important claim: that patents serve to attract investment in new inventions. Using a novel quasi -experimental approach and an original dataset, I investigate whether the grant of a patent makes a business -methods software startup more likely to attract early -stage venture capital investment. In contrast to prior scholarship, I find no evidence that patents play a role in channeling investment to these startups, nor that they lead to more successful downstream outcomes such as acquisitions and initial public offerings. These findings have important implications for both patent policy and scholarship. First, this Article provides new evidence on the perennial controversy over whether business -methods software should be patenteligible. As Congress continues to contemplate new legislation to clarify the law of patentable subject matter, the results call into question a leading justification for granting patents in this area. Second, in light of previous scholarship which finds a relationship between patents and investment in other areas of technology, I demonstrate the importance of developing industry -specific evidence on the role that patents play in stimulating innovation.",2024,Government & Law,0
Early Disclosure of Invention and Reduced Duplication: An Empirical Test,AIPA; duplicative research; knowledge disclosure; patents; PRODUCT MARKET; PATENTS; SPILLOVERS; IDEAS,"Much work on innovation strategy assumes or theorizes that competition in innovation elicits duplication of research and that disclosure decreases such duplication. We validate this empirically using the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA), three complementary identification strategies, and a new measure of blocked future patent applications. We show that AIPA-intended to reduce duplication, through default disclosure of patent applications 18 months after filing-reduced duplication in the U.S. and European patent systems. The blocking measure provides a clear and micro measure of technological competition that can be aggregated to facilitate the empirical investigation of innovation, firm strategy, and the positive and negative externalities of patenting.",2020,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,0
Pledging Patent Rights for Fighting Against the COVID-19: From the Ethical and Efficiency Perspective,Patent pledges; Distributive justice; COVID-19; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; POOLS; INNOVATIONS; PRINCIPLES; THICKETS; BUSINESS,"In response to the great crises of the COVID-19 coronavirus, virtually all new technologies protected by patent rights have been used in practice from diagnostics, therapeutic, medical equipment, and vaccine to prevention, tracking, and containment of COVID-19. However, the moral justification of patent rights is questioned when pharmaceutical patents conflict with public health. This paper proposes a revised approach of deciding on how to address the conflicts between business ethics and patent protections and then compares the different mechanisms of clearing patent thickets. Our findings highlight that patent pledges may not only contribute to achieving the maximized substantive justice of the public but also help patent pledgors fulfill procedural justice. The advantages of patent pledges have attracted many patent holders to make public statements during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the disadvantages of a free license may make patent pledges not sustainable for a long time without the related supporting measures. Our findings will be helpful for policymakers or company managers to make an appropriate decision on rationally utilizing patent portfolios for fighting against public health crises.",2022,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0

The degree of IPR protection in two countries differs in terms of patent breadth, which determines the markups of Northern firms and their Southern affiliates, respectively. In this model, stronger IPR protection in the South leads to a permanent decrease in the North-South wage gap, a temporary increase in the Northern innovation rate, and a permanent increase in technology transfer. By contrast, stronger IPR protection in the North leads to a permanent increase in the North-South wage gap, ambiguous effects on the Northern innovation rate, and a permanent decrease in technology transfer. Finally, we perform a quantitative analysis by calibrating the model to the US-China data, and the numerical results support these policy implications in addition to a welfare implication such that strengthening patent pro-tection in one country leads to sizable welfare improvements in both countries.

Intellectual property rights (IPRs) are becoming more important in a wide range of industries. In the same way, a country's intellectual strength can be judged by how many patents it has and how much research and development it does. The Cox-PH model and the accelerated failure time (AFT) model are used in this study to determine the patent's worth across the five major technology groups and ownership status. The final sample for survival analysis is made up of 40132 patents that were obtained from the Indian Patent Office between 1995 and 2005. (IPO). We find that broad academic patents don't last longer, but that the patent's ability to be used internationally makes it last longer. In contrast, institutional patents are geographically restricted. The collaboration appears to have a greater impact on patent value.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Can IP tribunals increase firm patent applications?-Empirical evidence from China,Property rights protection; Intellectual property tribunal; Firm innovation; Institutional change; China economy; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; PROTECTION; LAWS; INVESTMENT; OWNERSHIP,"This paper aims to examine whether property rights protection can enhance firm innovation. To address the endogeneity problem and establish a causal relationship, we adopt the establishment of Intellectual Property Tribunals (IP Tribunals) in China as a natural experiment and employ the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach for estimation. By measuring firm innovation via patents and invention patent applications, we find that establishing IP Tribunals can significantly boost firm innovation. Furthermore, we investigate the heterogeneity of our baseline results and discover that privately-owned firms, smaller-sized firms, non-high-tech firms, and firms located in less marketized areas experience a larger improvement in innovation. This finding suggests that this institutional improvement provides greater protection to disadvantaged firms. Breaking regional protectionism and relaxing firm financing constraints are two possible mechanisms through which IP Tribunals can enhance firm innovation. Our results provide new evidence on how institutional change affects economic growth in China.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Patenting patterns in Artificial Intelligence: Identifying national and international breeding grounds,Artificial intelligence; Digitalisation; Patent analysis; International comparison; Specialisation; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION,"This paper identifies countries at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development and proposes two novel patent-based indicators to differentiate structural differences in the patterns of intellectual property (IP) protection observed for AI across countries. In particular, we consider (i) the extent to which countries specialise in AI and are relevant markets for corresponding IP protection ('National Breeding Ground'); and (ii) the extent to which countries attract AI from abroad for IP protection and extend the protection of their AI-related IP to foreign markets ('International Breeding Ground'). Our investigation confirms prior findings regarding substantial changes in the technological leadership in AI, besides drastic changes in the relevance of AI techniques over time. Particularly, we find that National and International Breeding Grounds overlap only partially. China and the US can be characterised as dominant National Breeding Grounds. Australia and selected European countries, but primarily the US, are major International Breeding Grounds. We conclude that China promotes AI development with a major focus on IP protection in its domestic market, whereas the US sustains its AI progress in the international context as well. This might indicate a considerable bifurcation in the structural patterns of IP protection in global AI development.",2020,Information Science & Library Science,0
"Protection of patent law objects, created by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies",patent law; invention; patentability; human inventor; artificial intelligence (AI) inventor; ,"The aim of the article is to solve the scientific problem of outlining the issue of protection of patent law objects created using artificial intelligence technologies, and to establish whether it is possible to recognize artificial intelligence technologies as inventor at the present stage of development of legal systems. Philosophical, comparative-legal and system-structural methods were used in the research process. Based on the analysis of the European Patent Convention, the main generally accepted conditions of patentability of the invention are determined: novelty, inventive step, industrial applicability. It has been established that inventions created by artificial intelligence technologies will meet such criteria provided that certain requirements are met. In the context of the study, the case of the invention of artificial intelligence DABUS is analyzed and the results of its consideration in the European Patent Organization, the United Kingdom and the United States are summarized. In particular, it has been established that artificial intelligence technologies are currently not considered as inventors in either the Romano-Germanic or Anglo-Saxon legal systems.",2021,Social Sciences - Other Topics,0
Early Patent Disclosure and R&D Investment in Family Firms,; SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH; CORPORATE DISCLOSURE; PERFORMANCE; OWNERSHIP; PROPRIETARY; AGENCY; PUBLICATION; INFORMATION; INNOVATION; SUBSIDIES,"This paper shows that the American Inventor's Protection Act, which introduced the disclosure of patent applications after 18 months, that is, before a grant decision is taken and, hence, before it is known whether the respective technology will receive legal protection, is associated with a reduction of family firms' research and development (R&D) investment. This suggests that early disclosure of patent applications is perceived as a threat to family firms' innovation activity and discourages their R&D investment. This finding deserves our attention because family firms account for a large share of the US economy, and a reduction in their R&D investment can have long-term consequences.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Patented innovation and left-tail risk: Evidence from China,innovation; left-tail risk; patent; R&D; stock market; GROWTH; RIGHTS; CONSTRAINTS; INVESTMENT; STABILITY,"This study investigates the impact of patented innovation on the left-tail risk of stock price, measured as the 1% value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES). Using the sample of all listed firms in the Chinese A-share market from 2007 to 2020, we find that the quantity and quality of patents significantly decrease left-tail risk. Second, the effect is more pronounced for firms in regions with patent pledge systems or stronger intellectual property rights protection. Short-selling constraints and the engagement of retail investors hinder patented innovation from reducing left-tail risk. Third, we further explore the mechanisms and find that patented innovation enhances financial performance, mitigates financial constraints, and attracts long-term institutional investors, thereby decreasing left-tail risk.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Is Legal Harmonization Always Better? The Counter-Case of Utility Models,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; FEDERAL CIRCUIT; PATENT SYSTEM; LAW; MYTH; APPROPRIABILITY; PROTECTION; INNOVATION,"Policy makers and international institutions have long maintained that the global business environment is best supported when countries harmonize by adopting substantially uniform legal structures. This is particularly true in the context of intellectual property rights. When such national systems are similar, we believe that investment is undergirded and market participation is facilitated. However, this assumption may be incorrect in some cases. Marginal disharmony in certain intellectual property rights may provide countries space for experimentation while not impeding effective management of global intellectual property portfolios at the firm level. As evidence, we look to the utility model. This long-standing form of invention right is conspicuously and surprisingly unstandardized across the world, yet our analysis, using PATSTAT data, reveals that firms are able to negotiate this disharmony effectively. We employ a novel empirical method that tracks U.S.-priority patents to establish that firms use utility models to optimize their overall appropriability needs by region. Our study finds evidence that a firm may choose standard patent protection in one region and utility model protection in another, even though standard patent protection is available in both settings. We propose that a zone of appropriability preference exists when utility models and standard patents overlap, and this zone provides important strategic opportunities to firms with global intellectual properly portfolios. Our study thus provides an important counter-case for harmonization of national intellectual property laws. As a result, we suggest that such efforts be undertaken with more caution; in some cases, harmonization may do more harm than good.",2021,Business & Economics; Government & Law,0
Can China's national Five-Year Plan for environmental protection induce corporate green innovations?,Five-Year Plan for environmental protection; Corporate green innovations; Subsidy availability; Financing availability; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; COMPETITIVENESS; DIFFUSION; POLICY; COST; US,"This study investigates the effect of China's national Five-Year Plan for environmental protection (FYPEP) on corporate green innovations based on the two-way fixed effect model and panel data about the green patents of China's publicly listed corporations during 1990-2020. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of these green innovations is further discussed with reference to the types of innovation, enterprise ownership, and the location of the corporations. It is found that FYPEP significantly induced corporation green innovations at regional and industrial levels. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the inductive effect of FY PEP is stronger on green utility model patents than on green invention patents. State-owned enterprises react to green innovation policies more significantly than do private businesses. The inductive effect of FYPEP is stronger in Eastern China than in mid- and Western China. From the perspective of government intervention, this research renders a new framework for the formulation of policies of national environmental protection and corporate green innovation.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Data exclusivity and patent monopoly extension: A view from Australia,access to medicines; data exclusivity; patent; pharmaceutical monopoly extension; ,"Data exclusivity and patents are important to the pharmaceutical industry, and both these regimes coexist in the pharmaceutical landscape. Both data exclusivity and patents provide market exclusivity through monopoly periods. Because data exclusivity and patents can protect the same pharmaceutical, beginning at different times in the pharmaceutical lifecycle and having different durations, these terms may not coincide, and each can extend the effective market exclusivity period of the other. For example, when data exclusivity persists beyond patent expiry for a pharmaceutical, subsequent entrant access to the market is restricted and the period during which originators can charge high prices is extended. This article seeks to eliminate the situation where patent monopolies have expired, but data exclusivity remains in force by proposing a method to ensure that data exclusivity and patent terms expire simultaneously. Further, the proposal maintains the protection to innovators afforded by both data exclusivity and patents, recognising that these regimes protect different things in pharmaceutical development.",2024,Government & Law,0

Using a panel dataset of Chinese manufacturing firms, we find that VC-backed firms outperform non-VC-backed ones in patenting activities, new product sales, and exports because of the ex-ante selection and ex-post value-added effects of VC investment. Firms with better performance in innovation are more likely to get VC support, and such outperformance is magnified after the VC investment is made. Moreover, the impact of VC investment on firm innovation is greater when the protection of IPR is stronger. In addition, firms backed by more experienced VC firms (VCFs) generate more commercialized innovation but are less productive in patenting activities than firms backed by less experienced VCFs. Finally, firms backed by state-owned VCFs outperform in patenting activities but underperform in commercialized innovation those backed by other types of VCFs.

This study quantifies the knowledge exploration distance of individual patents using network embedding methods and citation analysis. First, a technology ecology network is constructed to identify technological association relationships between technical elements. Second, network embedding method is employed to represent technical elements as fixed dimensional vector, preserving the structural information. Next, the individual patents are vectorized based on the technology classification code information and pre-trained embedding values. Finally, by comparing the position between a citing patent and cited patents in the vector space, the knowledge exploration distance of the patent is obtained. This knowledge exploration distance indicates the novel degree of technological association between technical elements of a citing patent and those of cited patents. The case study covering artificial intelligence technology-related patents is conducted to illustrate the process of calculating knowledge exploration distance. Besides, this study showed that the proposed measure has significant relationships with patent-based indicators related to protection coverage, prior knowledge, and patent value.",2022,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,0

Patenting trends of such technologies are an indicator of the pace of innovation at the invention stage. Empirical studies looking at the real-world patenting activity can provide valuable evidence to help assess and guide policy proposals related to intellectual property rights (IPRs), innovation and governance of quantum technologies. In this paper, we report the results of a study designed to map the patent landscape of quantum technologies. We evaluate the patenting trends over the last 20 years to determine: (1) the growth of quantum technology patents, (2) the technology breakdown and classification of patenting activity, (3) the choice of priority patent office, (4) the types of patent claims and strategies, (5) the subject matter of recently awarded patents, (6) the top patent owners, (7) the dominant patent portfolios, and (8) the geographical distribution of this patent activity. Based on our patent landscape study, we critically examine if patent protection is posing a problem in the technical field of quantum technologies.

Therefore, this study aims to suggest a predictive model for patent transaction considering a wide range of decision variables. For this purpose, this study highlighted two considerations-technological impact of technology donor and technological proximity in previous patent transactions. Six factors are employed for developing our predictive model-technological strength, knowledge accumulation, technological protection scope, technological jurisdiction, technological strength of companies, and previous history of patent transfers. Five machine learning techniques are employed. As a result, we find that technological strength of companies and previous transfer history significantly affect technology transfer.

Regional financial support and necessary IPP are vital to the sustainable patent output of SMEs. However, empirical evidence to investigate the role of RRDI and intensity of IPP is insufficient. Therefore, this study aims to reveal the effect of RDFS on the sustainable patent output of SMEs and analyze the role of RRDI and intensity of IPP in the relationship between RDFS and SMEs' sustainable patent output. We collected data from the R&D activities of SMEs in 30 provinces of China and performed maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of six equations. The empirical results show that RDFS have a positive impact on the sustainable patent output of SMEs. Besides, RRDI plays a mediating role in the relationship between RDFS and the sustainable patent output of SMEs. Third, the mediating role of regional R&D personnel input (RRDPI) is more obvious than that of R&D fund input (RRDFI). Finally, the intensity of IPP significantly moderates the direct effect of RDFS on the sustainable patent output of SMEs and the mediation effect via RRDI.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Standard-essential patent legal protection in China's telecommunication industry: an international trade and economy perspective,Standard-essential patents; FRAND principles; patent hold-up; licence fee rates; anti-suit injunction; ,"Standard-essential patents (SEPs) are specific types of patents that protect the technology incorporated in a standard. China has one of the world's largest telecommunication markets, and its legal policies and practices regarding SEP protection profoundly influence the competitive environment of the Chinese telecommunication market, international economic and trade cooperation, and global telecommunication technology innovation. Recently, frequent disputes in the communication sector surrounding SEPs in China's judicial practice revolved around the fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) principles, embodying three key issues: patent hold-up, licence fee rates, and anti-suit injunction. Regarding the patent hold-up and hold-out of SEPs in the telecommunication industry, a balance of interests between SEP holders and implementers in licence negotiations should be achieved under the guidance of the principles of FRAND from the perspective of legislation, administrative management, and the judiciary. Concerning licence fee rates, billing benchmarks should be judged based on individual cases, utilizing a comprehensive approach combining comparable licence agreement methods and top-down methods to determine a fair and reasonable licencing fee acceptable to all parties.

The core assumption of this paper is that the occurrence of firm patenting is positively related to innovation strategies. As a result, we place the emphasis on the diverse ways to innovate and we identify their effects on a firm's probability to patent.

"Patent policy, imitation incentives, and the rate of cumulative innovation",Patent policy; Patent validity; Patent length; Imitation; Litigation; Cumulative innovation; SEQUENTIAL INNOVATION; LITIGATION; PATENTABILITY; PERSISTENCE; SETTLEMENT,"We study an infinite-horizon cumulative innovation model, in which patents are characterized by their length and the likelihood of being ruled valid in a patent infringement litigation. Strengthening patent protection via a greater validity or length has two opposing effects on innovation: 1) a negative litigation effect due to increasing the litigation threat for future innovators; and 2) a positive competition effect due to reducing profit-eroding imitation by competitive firms without innovation capacity. The optimal innovation-maximizing patent policy balances these two opposing effects. For moderate patent validity, longer remaining lifetime increases innovation due to the competition effect. The opposite is true for higher validity, for which the litigation effect dominates. Moderate validity and infinite patent length maximizes innovation when future profits are subject to greater discounting and R&D costs are low, while strong validity and finite length stimulates more innovation under lower discounting and higher R&D costs.

We then conduct the analysis using the large-scale, comprehensive annual Inventors Survey database (ISDB) collected by CNIPA, which consists of 12,869 firms linked to 30,693 patents granted between 2010 and 2012. We find that the median and average revenues from firms' implementation of their patents are RMB 0.75 million and 8.04 million respectively. Furthermore, we find that patents involving higher R&D investments, invention patents, patents essential to standards and belonging to patent pools command a higher value. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) produce lower value patented inventions relative to domestic private firms and foreign firms. Larger firms and those with intellectual property departments and aggressive in patent litigation have higher value inventions. Our findings yield important theoretical, methodological and policy implications.",2021,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0
Landscape of Genome Editing Technology Patents in the European Patent Office with a Focus on CRISPR-Related Opposition Proceedings,genome editing; CRISPR-Cas9; EPO; opposition; appeal; RNA,"In technologies for editing genomic DNA, cellular repair mechanisms are employed which facilitate manipulation of the genomic DNA. When a double-stranded DNA break is introduced at specific sites in the genome, the cellular repair mechanism takes over and facilitates targeted genome editing via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), thereby creating so-called insertion or deletion mutations (indels) at the cleaved target site. Alternatively, if a suitable donor polynucleotide is present, the donor can be integrated at the cleaved target site in the genome via homology-directed repair. In the last decades, four major DNA cutting tools were developed that paved the way for successful genome editing, i.e., meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) (CRISPR-Cas9) systems. Patent protection for each one of these genome editing tools was obtained at the European Patent Office (EPO). In the last decade, since its elucidation in 2012, several parties tried to obtain broad patent protection for CRISPR-Cas9. This article focuses on the genome editing tools, patents that were granted for these technologies and, particularly, on opposition proceedings regarding CRISPR-Cas9 patents that relate to CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing.",2023,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0
Applying Deep Learning Technologies to Evaluate the Patent Quality with the Collaborative Training,; ,"As the country vigorously promotes the development of science and technology and tries to enhance independent innovation capabilities, more and more attention is paid on the protection of technology ownership. In recent years, China has developed rapidly in many scientific and technological fields, and the number of patent applications increased year by year. However, various patent quality problems including immature patent technology and low patent authorization rate appear. The indicators of patent quantification and quality evaluation are studied in this paper. First, we quantify the patent quality evaluation indicators and combine the content of the patent text to build a patent evaluation model. US patents with patent grade labels are used for training with multitask learning technology. Second, the evaluation model is transferred from the English patents to the Chinese patents, in which the active learning technology and transfer learning technology are used to minimize the work of manual labeling. Finally, a Chinese patent quality evaluation model based on collaborative training was designed and implemented. Methods used in this experiment have notably improved the prediction effect of the model and achieved a better migration effect. A large number of experimental results show that the Chinese patent quality evaluation model has achieved good evaluation results. This research uses deep learning and natural language processing technology to carry out research on patent quality evaluation models from different perspectives, to provide patent decision support for related companies, and to point out research directions for research institutions and patent inventors.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,0
Protection heterogeneity in a harmonized European patent system,Patent litigation; Patent systems; Harmonization; National courts; Unified patent court; LITIGATION; SELECTION; SCOPE; UK,"This study proposes a divergent expectation model for patent infringement disputes, where both litigation and settlement are driven by patent quality. Under the model, patent quality depends on both broadness and definiteness of the patent. The model predicts that technologies where the definiteness attribute can be estimated with high accuracy will have higher settlement rates. At trial, it is rather the assessment of the patent quality by the judge which decides the outcome. In its empirical section, the paper evaluates over a thousand hand-collected and hand-coded patent infringement and counterclaim decisions rendered by courts in the three largest patent granting European countries-Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The paper utilizes empirical methods to investigate whether the characteristics of the patents or the country of litigation predict the outcome of litigation. Examination of the patent characteristics is guided by the factors of our model, in that the patent quality, and underlying technology and industry are tested. The findings provide evidence of the continuing heterogeneity of the patent systems in Europe, despite the harmonization efforts. Demonstrated was the lack of importance of the characteristics of the litigated patent; rather, it was the forum to which the case was brought that was decisive. At the dawn of the Unified Patent Court, our study provides for a window into the extent of heterogeneity still prevailing and a starting point for monitoring the further development of European patent harmonization.",2020,Business & Economics; Government & Law,0

Improving the Patent Notice System: Replacing the Duty to Mark with a Unified Patent-Product Database,; ,"The U.S. patent system is deficient in giving the public proper notice of what technologies are under patent protection. The current system relies on patent marking, which involves imprinting products with patent information that cover the product, to give constructive notice to the public. Recent data indicates that marking products with a website-called virtual marking-is not widely used. The problem lies with the overall costs, risks, and impracticability of marking certain products. Given the already dubious nature of constructive notice, the lack of virtual marking is a sign that patent law should improve its notice system. The lack of notice contributes to innocent infringement and an overall high societal cost that cuts against innovation. This Note argues that a unified patent-product database would improve notice to inventors to prevent infringement and generally encourage innovation. The database could borrow ideas from an effective database like the Food and Drug Administration's Orange Book, a well-established drug database for the pharmaceutical industry. This Note also looks into how other components of the Patent Notice System would be improved, including the current U.S. patent database and the patent disclosure system.",2021,Government & Law,0

This, however, does not imply that only he or she is capable of understanding the descriptions (here: that only a tailor is capable of understanding the descriptions of cuts and seams), save for exceptional situations.The interpretation of a patent is to be carried out according to principles of hermeneutic rationality, according to which, the literal meaning of the technical words used in the claims and their logical meaning shall be taken into account, according to both the overall sense of the content of the patent and the criterion of the balance between protection for the owner and legal certainty for third parties.For the purpose of verifying infringement by equivalence, first it is necessary to determine the scope of protection conferred by the patent by analytically identifying the various features of the invention, as they are expressly claimed in the patent text and interpreted, including on the basis of their description and the accompanying drawings. It is then necessary to ascertain whether each element in the claims is found in the allegedly infringing product, even if only by equivalence.",2024,Government & Law,0
"Trade Secret Protection on a Publicly Sold, Patented Spinal Implant Device: Life Spine, Inc. v.

Aegis Spine, Inc., 8 F.4th 531 (7th Cir. 2021), an important decision providing trade secret protection on a publicly sold, patented spinal implant device. For an implant comprised of multiple components and subcomponents, the precise measurements of the implant's components and subcomponents can be protectable as trade secret information, even though a patent has disclosed the implant's structure. Life Spine teaches that a patent covering such an implant reveals nothing about how to measure precise dimensions of those components or subcomponents, that public displays of an implant product must be done with limiting a visitor's ability to observe the product, that an implant product is sold through non-public channels directly to surgeons or hospitals, and that delivery and surgical use of an implant product must be done with forbidding others who have no confidentiality duties from examining the implant product.",2023,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,0

The results show that local governments' environmental emphasis has a significant positive impact on the number of green patents of enterprises. More importantly, local governments' environmental attention mainly plays its role by improving the environmental protection awareness of corporate executives and increasing environmental protection subsidies. In addition, the effect of local governments' environmental emphasis is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises, firms with low financing constraints, and heavily polluting firms. Further research finds that local governments' environmental emphasis has a significant role in promoting the number of green invention patents and non-invention patents, but only green invention patents enhance the intrinsic value of enterprises.",2022,Business & Economics,0
How to Exploit Patents for Innovation?

Many solutions are recommended to foster the integration of research and development, and intellectual property such as recycling, water cleaning, treatment of poisonous exhausted air, energy saving, green technology for conserving ecosystems. To have more inventions and patents, Vietnam needs to protect its intellectual property rights (IPRs) involving all its various sectors and entities more. However, the current status of IPRs protection in Vietnam shows limitations in this field due to lack of appropriate legal rules on civil and criminal sanctions. This article will give an overview of IPRs protection in Vietnam and then analyze some current provisions relating to civil and criminal sanctions for IPRs infringement based on the experiences of some foreign countries. It will also recommend some solutions for overcoming these challenges.",2024,Government & Law,0
Named Entity Recognition of Traditional Chinese Medicine Patents Based on BiLSTM-CRF,; ,"With the growing popularity of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the world and the increasing awareness of intellectual property protection, the number of TCM patent application is growing year by year. TCM patents contain rich medical, legal, and economic information. Effective text mining of TCM patents is of great theoretical and practical significance (e.g., the R&D of new medicines, patent infringement litigation, and patent acquisition). Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing and a crucial step before indepth analysis of TCM patent. In this paper, a method combining Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural network with Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM-CRF) is proposed to automatically recognize entities of interest (i.e., herb names, disease names, symptoms, and therapeutic effects) from the abstract texts of TCM patents. By virtue of the capabilities of deep learning methods, the semantic information in the context can be learned without feature engineering. Experiments show that the BiLSTM-CRF-based method provides superior performance in comparison with various baseline methods.",2021,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,0
Direct foreign investment and intellectual property reform in the South,foreign direct investment inflows; intellectual property reform; post-TRIPs implementation; PATENT PROTECTION; RIGHTS; INNOVATION,"We study the association between intellectual property (IP) reform in developing countries and their foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows over 2004-2015, after their transition period under the World Trade Organization. Using conditional difference-in-differences estimation, we find unambiguous evidence that stronger IP rights spur FDI inflows. Further, this response is heterogenous across countries and time. Whereas the effect of a unit increase in IP protection on the percentage increase in FDI$$ FDI $$ inflows remains about 0.50 for countries with small magnitudes of knowledge assets (roughly 15 'international patents'), it declines to about 0.25 for countries with larger knowledge capital (say, 5000 'international patents').

"Patent infringement litigation, executive team risk appetite and corporate innovation",Patent infringement litigation; corporate innovation; executive risk preferences; dynamic competition; innovation investment; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; UPPER ECHELONS; CONSEQUENCES; ORGANIZATION; INDUSTRY; RIVALRY; RIGHTS; TRADE,"Comprehensively deepening the trial mechanism of patent infringement litigation is important for optimizing law environment for scientific and technological innovation. However, the growing frequency for patent infringement lawsuits significantly impacts the corporate innovation. The existing literature focuses on the direct relationship between patent infringement litigation and corporate innovation without exploring the mechanisms. Based on this, this paper analyzed the effect between patent infringement litigation and innovation and heterogeneity using a fixed effects model on the theoretical model basis. The study found that patent infringement litigation has a positive impact on innovation investment; patent infringement litigation promotes innovative activity through foreign direct investment; executive team risk appetite negatively moderates the relationship between patent infringement litigation and firms' innovation investment. Patent infringement litigation has a more significant incentive effect on the innovation activities of state-owned enterprises, more open regions, and in the northeast and east regions. This paper not only reveals the mechanism that judicial litigation affects innovation activities but also provides a reference basis to solve patent disputes.",2024,Business & Economics,0
The Divisional Game: Using Procedural Rights to Impede Generic/Biosimilar Market Entry,Divisional patent applications; Procedural rights; Pharmaceutical patents; Double patenting; PATENTS,"Despite being used frequently by practitioners in a wide array of technical fields, divisional patent applications (divisionals) seldom attract scholarly attention. The lack of scholarly attention is an error, particularly in the pharmaceutical field. Recent case law in the UK reveals that after generic/biosimilar manufacturers successfully revoke patents standing in the way of market entry, divisionals claiming protection for similar subject-matter as the patent that has just been revoked can crop up, hindering generic/biosimilar medicines from entering the market. Moreover, right before or after proceedings start, rightsholders de-designate countries to avoid a negative judgment that may affect a court elsewhere, meaning generic/biosimilar manufacturers initiated legal proceedings for nothing. Such practices demonstrate that divisionals deserve our attention. This article thus fills the scholarly gap by showing how divisionals are (mis)used in practice, before arguing that patent reform is necessary to prevent this from occurring.",2022,Government & Law,0
Climate disasters and processing of green patents,climate disasters; patent examination; salience bias; UNITED-STATES; TEMPERATURE; SENTIMENT; SALIENCE; OFFICE,"Using Chinese data, this paper reveals that climate disaster events have a positive impact on the granting of green invention patents. The occurrence of climate disasters leads the patent-granting officials to overestimate the likelihood of disaster recurrence, strengthens their perception of environmental protection as urgent, and consequently increases the number of patents that they grant. Salience bias, the tendency to overestimate probabilities due to the occurrence of salient events, is widely studied in psychology and behavioral finance. This paper extends this research by examining the influence of salience bias on people's behavior in processing green invention patents, with a specific focus on climate disaster events in Beijing, the headquarters of China's patent examination authority. In addition to the overall positive impact on granted patent numbers, the paper finds that (i) the influence of salience bias is temporary, with a more pronounced effect on energy-saving patents than on other categories of patents, and (ii) the primary effect is on green invention patents filed by firms in Beijing, with the effect of salience bias rapidly diminishing as the distance of the application city from Beijing increases.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Economic policy uncertainty and industry innovation: Cross country evidence,Economic policy uncertainty; External finance; Information asymmetry; High-tech; Innovation; Investment; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY; FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; INVESTMENT; IMPACT,"We use the fixed effects identification strategy to examine the impact of economic policy uncertainty on innovation using cross-country industry data and how country institutions moderate this relationship. Our findings show that economic policy uncertainty impedes innovation across all five innovation proxy measures; patent counts, patenting entities, citations per patent, patent originality, and patent generality. Our study uncovers three economic mechanisms that potentially explain the negative relationship between economic policy uncertainty and technological innovation. We show that patent counts, patenting entities, patent citations, patent originality, and patent generality fall following high economic policy uncertainty episodes via the risk-tolerance, financial, and information channels. We also provide evidence that the adverse effects of economic policy uncertainty on innovation are moderate in countries with higher levels of transparency, more liberalized financial markets and higher property and patent rights protection. Our paper provides evidence on the real effects of economic policy uncertainty shocks on the economy. (C) 2022 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this respect, the study was conducted to understand patentability nature and prosecution timelines for patent protected indigenous dairy technologies. Investigators had examined 28 herbal pharmaceutical patent grant(s) from grassroots innovators/outstanding knowledge holders. Patent applications were filed between 2007-2014, prosecution were held and accorded patent grant during 2019-2022. The study noted that Section 3 (d), (e) and (p) were principal factors involved while defending veterinary pharmaceutical patent applications. About 46 percent did not have Section 3 (d) objections inferring these medicinal practices followed by dairy farmers were unique. It was observed that majority of patent grants were in product category illustrating transformation of national patent regime from process patent to product-patent grant system. Overall time taken for availing grant was about ten years with an average prosecution period of 2.6 years. Therapeutic efficacy, synergistic action and suitable claim amendments are pertinent features in responding to prosecution stages. These pharmaceutical product patents from social innovation are of interest to dairy industry.

The study is motivated by the evidence from the Korean data showing the existence of two groups of sectors where firms in the one group tended to file more trademarks than patents. We find that in the first group of sectors, like food, apparel, and pharmaceuticals, trademarks have been the most applied form of the IPRs with a much larger number of their registrations than patents from the initial stage of development until recently, whereas in the second group of sectors, like electronics and automobiles, the main IPR form has been patents. Regressions on the determinants about this bifurcation find that the trademark groups are those sectors involving more tacit knowledge and/or domestic market orientation associated with slow progress in technological capabilities. The results are important because it implies the existence of alternative path of economic development by the latecomer firms in different sectors, beside the patent-driven path which is already verified in Kim et al. (2012). Appropriate intellectual property protection and economic growth in countries at different levels of development.

Exploring SureChEMBL from a drug discovery perspective,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; CHEMICAL-STRUCTURE; PATENT LANDSCAPE; IDENTIFICATION; SOLUBILITY; TARGET,"In the pharmaceutical industry, the patent protection of drugs and medicines is accorded importance because of the high costs involved in the development of novel drugs. Over the years, researchers have analyzed patent documents to identify freedom-to-operate spaces for novel drug candidates. To assist this, several well-established public patent document data repositories have enabled automated methodologies for extracting information on therapeutic agents. In this study, we delve into one such publicly available patent database, SureChEMBL, which catalogues patent documents related to life sciences. Our exploration begins by identifying patent compounds across public chemical data resources, followed by pinpointing sections in patent documents where the chemical annotations were found. Next, we exhibit the potential of compounds to serve as drug candidates by evaluating their conformity to drug-likeness criteria. Lastly, we examine the drug development stage reported for these compounds to understand their clinical success. In summary, our investigation aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the patent compounds catalogued in SureChEMBL, assessing their relevance to pharmaceutical drug discovery.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0

We illustrate that due to weak protection of intellectual property rights in China, firms rely on external legal resources, which are found to be positively related to patenting performance in terms of the capability of external patent law expertise, but negatively related in terms of knowledge diversity. The marginal effect of the level of external patent law expertise on patenting performance is positive when research and development (R&D) invest-ment is low and negative when it is high, illustrating the negative interaction between R&D investment and the level of external patent law expertise. Furthermore, institutional pressure and support moderate the effect of the level of external patent law expertise on patenting performance. This study advances the under-standing of the impact of patent institutions on patent strategies in transition economies and provides novel implications for policy and patent management.

Nonobvious Design,; PROCESSING FLUENCY; VISUALLY COMPLEX; PRODUCT DESIGN; PACKAGE DESIGN; PRINCIPLE; NOVELTY; PERCEPTIONS; CHALLENGES; EXPERIENCE; PREFERENCE,"To earn patent protection, a claimed product design must be nonobvious. Yet while nonobviousness has been described as the heart and cornerstone of the utility patent system, in the design patent context, the term has become next to useless. Instead of actually policing nonobviousness in design, modern courts grant patent rights to any work that is not an exact replica of another. The problem, judges maintain, is that comparing one visual design against another demands the use of aesthetic judgment and aesthetic judgment is an instinctual, subjective process incapable of legal definition. Recent neuroscientific studies of aesthetic judgment dispel some of the mystery surrounding perception of industrial design. These studies show, contrary to longstanding judicial assumptions, that design innovation tends to reduce visual enjoyment. We prefer the aesthetic middle: the range of designs comprised of not the avant-garde or the tried and true, but something in between. New insight into the functioning of the aesthetic middle shows the need for a reevaluation of the nonobviousness standard and offers guidance for returning the standard to its former place as a meaningful limit on design patent protection.",2023,Government & Law,0

The role of political ties and political uncertainty in corporate innovation,Political connections; Corporate innovation; R & Patents; Board of directors; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; POLICY UNCERTAINTY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; CONNECTED BOARDS; DARK SIDE; DIRECTORS; OWNERSHIP; MODELS; CHINA; CONSTRAINTS,"We examine the relationship between firms' political connections and corporate innovation in a European context. We also consider the moderating effect of political connections on the relationship between political uncertainty and firms' innovation. We use two different metrics of innovation: R&D (an input measure), and patent counts (an output measure). We find that firms with former politicians on their board of directors invest less in R&D than their counterpart firms. However, the presence of this type of director on the board is positively associated with the number of a firm's patent applications. It seems that, although political ties reduce the amount of resources devoted to R&D activities, they increase the effectiveness of intellectual rights protection. Results also show that political uncertainty decreases R&D investment but exacerbates the need for legal protection of innovation through patents. According to our results, political connections attenuate the effect of political uncertainty on firm innovation such that the negative (positive) effect of uncertainty on R&D intensity (patents) weakens when the firm is politically connected.",2022,Business & Economics; Development Studies,0

"Patent Term Extension (PTE) Regime in Australia: Amendments and Analysis of Granted, Pending, and Refused PTE Applications",Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods; Federal Court of Australia; Patent Term Extension; Pharmaceutical Substance; Therapeutic Goods Administration; ,"Patents are governed by the Patent Act 1990 in Australia. The adoption of Trade-Related Aspect of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement in 1995, raised the standard patent term from 16 to 20 years in Australia. For pharmaceutical innovators, 20-year term may found to be insufficient to recoup the investment in research and development (R&D), because a substantial time is required for regulatory review process before approval of the pharmaceutical product and thus, start of its actual marketing. To address this concern, the possibility of extension of the patent term beyond 20 years was introduced in Australia in 1998 by amending the Patent Act 1990. This patent term extension provision came into effect on 27 January 1999. No separate or sui generis right came into existence; rather, the duration of the patent was increased by a particular period of time, referred to as 'Patent Term Extension(s)' (PTE) in Australia and United States of America (USA), 'Certificate of Supplementary Protection' (CSP) in Canada, and `Supplementary Protection Certificate' (SPC) in Europe. Since the implementation of PTE regime in Australia, a few changes took effect. This article provides an in-depth evaluation of PTE in Australia and other relevant changes. It also covers comparative analysis of number of PTE applications granted, pending, refused, and withdrawn in Australia. It was found that during these years, about 92% applications were awarded PTEs, 4% were refused and the remaining applications are awaiting decision. About 70% PTE applications cited product patents, while about 31% applications cited combination/composition patents and remaining 8% applications cited method of use patents. About 57% of granted PTEs received an extension of more than 4 years to 5 years. This article also provides analysis of type of patents referred in the PTE applications, the applicants and term of granted PTEs. Comprehensive summary of Federal Court of Australia and Full Federal Court of Australia cases is provided. These cases are related to challenges filed by PTE applicants over refusal of their applications, revocation of granted patents and challenges to the validity of granted PTE by the Commissioner of Patents, Intellectual Property Office, IP Australia, and these cases are providing directions to the Commissioner of Patents and has potential to act as precedence for future decisions on PTE.

Intellectual property laws like copyright, patent, and confidential commercial information law facilitate can increase business outputs, economic growth, and green production standards. The objective of the article is to analyze copyright, patent, and confidential commercial information laws in Saudi Arabia to see the availability of these laws in encouraging and protecting energy -efficient innovation while contributing to achieving sustainable development. Content analysis, doctrinal research method, and comparative legal analysis were used to achieve the research objective. The research findings demonstrate that the three selected legislation could be extended to protect energy -efficient innovation in Saudi Arabia though there is a need to amend some of the provisions of the existing laws. However, creating public awareness of the availability of laws and proper implementation of the laws are necessary to protect energy -efficient innovation. The article proposes recommendations to the policymakers about the need for further improvement of the law and its enforcement. The findings of this research could fill the gap in the literature on the assessment of intellectual property law to protect energy -efficient innovation in Saudi Arabia.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0

As the diffusion of innovation is generated outside the region, patent transfer may have a promoting or crowding out effect on urban innovation quality. We analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of China's urban patent transfer network. This empirical study, considering the heterogeneity of cities and patents, found that patent introduction in developed cities will promote substantive innovation measured by the proportion of invention patent. Additionally, the patent outward transfer has a crowding-out effect on the sustainable innovation of underdeveloped cities. Further analysis shows that when the institutional threshold of intellectual property protection is exceeded, the promotion of patent introduction and outward transfer in developed cities to local substantive innovation will be significantly enhanced. Conversely, in underdeveloped cities, the impact of patent outward transfer on substantive and sustainable innovation will change from promoting effect to crowding-out effect, that is, it induces the market failure of local technological innovation.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Do cross-border patents promote trade?,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; CURRENCY UNIONS; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; GRAVITY; EXPORTS; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT,"While we would expect that cross-border patents are used to protect a technology that is made available in another country, that technology could either be produced locally or imported. International patent filings could therefore be either complements or substitutes to international trade. This study combines data on patenting and trade for 149 countries and 249 industries between 1974 and 2006 with a three-way panel data model that addresses several biases emphasized in the trade literature in order to provide a systematic analysis of how bilateral trade responds to cross-border patent filings. We find that cross-border patents have a positive (complementary) overall effect on the patent-filing country's exports to the patent-granting country and no effect overall on imports flowing in the opposite direction. These effects vary substantially across industry groups, with patents promoting significantly more export growth in industries with a high demand elasticity and in industries that are relatively more downstream in supply chains. We also find that patents, once obtained, are associated with increased trade even in jurisdictions with weak intellectual property regimes.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Open science in play and in tension with patent protections,Ethics; intellectual property protections; open science; policy; qualitative research; KNOWLEDGE,"The open science (OS) movement has garnered increasing support in academia alongside continued financial and reputational incentives to obtain intellectual property (IP) protections over research outputs. Here, we explore stakeholder perspectives about intersections between OS and IP to inform the development of institutional OS guidelines for the neurosciences in Canada. We held six focus groups and three interviews with 29 faculty members from a major research and clinical center in Canada. The semi-structured interview guide probed perspectives on the respective roles of patents and OS in neuroscience-related research. We applied thematic content analysis to the transcript data, and extracted 12 major themes and 30 subthemes. Participants perceived a conflict between OS ideologies and the inherently restrictive nature of patents, and highlighted the importance of autonomy, justice, and respectful, culturally safe research practices in any future adoption of OS. Overall, the data suggest that a hybrid OS-IP policy model supported by local expertise may be best suited to meet the priorities and values of the community while mitigating perceived threats. This model includes expanded education about patenting, incentivized data sharing and collaboration, and tangible resources to support implementation of OS that includes skilled support in digital research infrastructures.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,0
Brain Patents as a Legal or Societal Challenge?,Brain patents; Neurolaw; Neuroethics; Human rights; Ordre public; Misuse; ,"Patents relating to the human brain and its functions regularly fulfil the general patent requirements. In some cases, however, the inventions in question reveal considerable risks for the rights of individuals, but also for society as such, which have a hitherto unknown dimension and which have not been discussed so far. Due to the limited scope of application of the ordre public clause, patent law is fundamentally not in a position to respond adequately to the challenges that exist here. The ratio of patent law and the lack of resources and also, above all, competence of the patent offices for a more extensive ethico-legal analysis mean that patent law is not the right setting for dealing with the existing challenges. Instead, the international organisations responsible for the protection of human rights and their relevant bodies are in particular demand here, although they have so far been unaware of the difficulties that are evident in the area of brain patents. What is needed is the development and establishment of mechanisms that enable the flagging and communication of critical patents, so that the responsible bodies are enabled to fulfil their tasks.",2023,Government & Law,0
A New Patent Mediation and Arbitration Centre for Europe,; ,"With the Unitary Patent (UP) and Unified Patent Court, some Member States of the European Union are creating a new system that reaches beyond the existing European Patent (EP). The goal of the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court is to reduce fragmentation and provide more uniform territorial patent protection by establishing a centralized patent court. In an effort to promote alternative dispute resolution, the Agreement also provides for the creation of a Patent Mediation and Arbitration Centre. This is the first statutory mechanism that recognizes the availability of arbitration for resolving certain types of intellectual property (IP) disputes at an EU-wide level. With thirteen states having ratified the Protocol on Provisional Application, the entry-into-force clause has been triggered and the last part of the preparatory work has commenced. The new system is expected to be fully implemented in early 2023.This article first introduces the new Centre and its role within the framework of the Unitary Patent System (section 1). It then explains the operation of the Centre (section 2) and analyses the Centre's impact on the arbitrability of claims relating to patent invalidity or scope (section 3).",2023,Government & Law,0
Patent transformation opportunity to realize patent value: Discussion about the conditions to be used or exchanged,Heterogeneous network; Transformation opportunity; Transformation condition; MODEL,"Innovation-driven development worldwide is driving scientific and technological (Sci-Tech) progress. As an important form of Sci-Tech achievements, patents provide effective protection and transformation opportunities for Sci-Tech innovations; this includes using and exchanging of patents to realize their value. However, realizing patent value involves some challenges: (1) discovering the transformation opportunities and (2) determining the conditions needed to realize patent transformation. To solve these challenges, we introduce a heterogeneous network-based transformation prediction model to discover transformation opportunities and explain the transformation conditions. The model includes: (1) construction of a heterogeneous network, (2) a heterogeneous network-based transformation opportunity prediction method, and (3) a heterogeneous network-based transformation conditions explainable method. The results obtained show that the proposed model can discover transformation opportunities with high evaluation measurements and explainable transformation conditions.",2021,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,0

We demonstrate that linking frequency of patenting abroad and FDI participation increased, and that the bi-directional causal relationship between patentees and official foreign direct investment (OFDI) is strongly heterogeneous with some positive effects. This indicates causality from international patenting to FDI and not vice versa. Hence, the number of patents registered by foreigners helps FDI investors to conduct investments.",2024,Business & Economics,0
"Hello, World? Domestic Software Patent Protection Stands Alone Due to Uncertain Subject Matter Eligibility Jurisprudence",; NEED; LAW,"In the last sixteen years, software-related inventions have encompassed the majority of all utility patents issued in the United States. Further, studies estimate that spending within the global information technology market will grow to $4.6 trillion in 2023, as industries such as data security, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence continue to innovate and expand at alarming rates. Needless to say, software is a crucial and ever-expanding industry for the global economy. In a series of recent cases, however, the Supreme Court injected unpredictability into the patenting of software and computer-implemented inventions by overhauling the long-standing patentable subject matter doctrine. Embodied in 101 of the Patent Act, the patentable subject matter requirement for patent protection refers to the basic substantive categories of invention that Congress and the courts have considered to be appropriate for patenting. The Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence has massively expanded subject matter eligibility restrictions under 101, thereby making it more difficult to obtain patent protection for certain types of inventions-notably, software inventions. As software patents have become more difficult to obtain and even more difficult to protect, the current patentable subject matter jurisprudence disparately harms small-scale inventors and startups who are reliant on the patent system to obtain crucial private capital from investors to support further innovation. Such issues are made glaringly apparent when comparing the domestic patentable subject matter jurisprudence to that of other technologically developed foreign nations, whose patent systems are more predictable and rewarding for software inventors. The Supreme Court's recent pivot has been met with substantial criticism by members of the intellectual property community across the political spectrum. Politicians, academics, district court and Federal Circuit judges, inventors, and former United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Directors have criticized the Supreme Court's framework and have urged Congress to act. Sparked by a recent denial for rehearing en banc wherein the Federal Circuit was evenly divided on the contours of 101, followed by the Supreme Court's refusal to grant certiorari, senators and prominent law organizations pitched legislative proposals on the Senate floor to abrogate the Supreme Court's framework and better protect emerging technologies, including software. This Note pushes the need for legislative revision to counteract the negative effects of the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence on the software industry and better align the United States with consistent global standards. Specifically, this Note thoroughly analyzes the history of the patentable subject matter doctrine, domestic proposals aimed at dismantling the current jurisprudence, and the way foreign patent systems handle patent eligibility restrictions for software inventions, to argue that domestic software innovation is disparately and negatively harmed by the Supreme Court's evolving framework for evaluating subject matter eligibility. Software innovation is paramount to the development of modern society, and thus the patent system should stand to support the patentability of software inventions, rather than hinder it.",2023,Government & Law,0

In the economy, there are cash constraints on R&D investment and the step size of innovation is endogenous. Within this framework, innovation policies affect economic growth through the arrival rate and the quality size of innovation. We find that with an endogenous innovation size, each of the three innovation policy instruments may have an inverted-U-shaped effect on growth. Moreover, we calibrate the model and quantify the interactive effects of innovation policies. Our results show that the interaction of different innovation policies significantly influences the growth effect of a single policy.",2022,Business & Economics,0

However, it is empirically questionable to distinguish the impact of discriminatory patent policy from the effect of the liabilities of foreignness. Therefore, international intervention to eliminate discriminatory treatment has been controversial. In this paper, we try to solve this conundrum by proposing a game-theory model to simulate the effect of strategic patent policy. The simulation results suggest that strategic patent policy measures are more likely to impede foreign patents that are (1) associated with R & D-intensive industries, (2) related to sectors where local firms' absorptive capability is weak, and (3) registered in other countries. These hypotheses are then tested empirically by using patent data bases of six major economies in the world. The empirical analysis provides evidence of the possible existence of strategic patent policy against foreign companies in Japan and China, especially in high-technology and medium-high-technology industries.",2023,Business & Economics,0

For identification, we exploit exogenous variation in patent right enforcement arising from the 2004 EU Enforcement Directive. This major policy reform strengthened IP rights and, thus, raised patent owners' asset position. We find that patenting firms significantly increase their use of debt and benefit from lower interest rates in response to the amendment, especially if they own valuable patent portfolios. These effects are most pronounced for relatively small and financially constrained firms, emphasizing the importance of the legal framework in fostering debt financing activities of innovation -oriented firms.",2024,Business & Economics,0
"Gender, occupational diversity of R&D teams and patents generation: an application to Spanish firms",; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; DIFFERENCE; VARIETY; MODELS; IMPACT,"This paper studies the relationship between gender and occupational diversity in R&D teams and their capacity to generate patents. It is based on an extensive sample of 4,085 firms from the Spanish Community Innovation Survey over the 2004-2014 period. Applying an exponential Poisson regression that controls for endogeneity through the generalised method of moments, the empirical results show that gender diversity has an ambiguous effect. Although it affects patents negatively, this impact is non-significant for patents with international protection. Patent generation is however positively affected by the diversity of categories in the R&D teams. Hence, the key question is not gender per se but rather the occupational status of the R&D teams.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Supplemental experimental data in Chinese pharmaceutical patent practice: acceptable or not?,supplemental experimental data; post filing data; medical innovation; pharmaceutical patent; ,"Experimental data is of great importance for pharmaceutical patents.

It is found that both the CNIPA and the courts hold that supplemental experimental data should be examined and can be accepted if the data meet the requirement of 'obtainable from the original disclosure'. It is suggested that the acceptability of supplemental experimental data be determined on a factual and factor basis in patent prosecution and judicial review. And it is envisioned that reasonable acceptance of supplemental experimental data would enhance the patent protection of pharmaceuticals and promote innovations in the health industry.",2022,Government & Law,0

This study uses data from 220 start-ups from different industries to evaluate the role of size, location, collaboration partners and financial means in patenting activity. Our results show a quadratic effect of size on patenting likelihood for start-ups, and patenting level reaches a tipping point for mediumsized start-ups. The findings also show that patenting likelihood is higher, regardless of the industry, when: (i) start-ups are located in international clusters or near other start-ups; (ii) start-ups collaborate with specialized research institutes; and (iii) start-ups are financed through crowdfunding campaigns. Location in co-working spaces seems, however, to be associated with lower patenting likelihood. These results help to illustrate the context in which start-ups value patents as protection instruments vs. as strategic resources to achieve other goals, such as reputation, or access to networks or financial capital. Analysing the reasons why start-ups patent is crucial due to the growing relevance these companies gain when they introduce innovations in the current economy.",2021,Business & Economics,0
Settled: Patent characteristics and litigation outcomes in the pharmaceutical industry,Pharmaceutical drugs; Patent protection; Paragraph IV settlement; INNOVATION,"A pharmaceutical company that seeks to produce a generic version of a brand drug before patent expiration can trigger a Paragraph IV litigation. However, generic and brand companies may avoid litigation through settlement, which sometimes involves payment to the generic company to delay generic entry. This behavior would be problematic if the settlement option was used to protect patents with low social value. This study explores the relationship between Paragraph IV litigation characteristics and the probability of a Paragraph IV settlement. Examining Paragraph IV settlements from 2003 to 2020, we find that the number of patents being litigated and the years of remaining market exclusivity are the strongest predictors of settlement. Moreover, we find no statistically significant relationship between active ingredient patents and settlement. This information may be helpful to regulators intending to promote the goals of the Hatch-Waxman Act.",2023,Business & Economics; Government & Law,0

However, when we controlled the impacts of certain factors, we found that the IP courts do not demonstrate a pro-patent propensity in their judgments. Furthermore, IP courts have not shown significant advantages in their judgments in aspects of speed, the rate of appeals, and the avoidance of mistakes.

The effect of intellectual property treaties on international innovation collaboration: a study based on USPTO patents during 1976-2017,Intellectual property rights; International treaties; Patent collaboration; Innovation system; Social network analysis; O35; ,"Purpose Studies have indicated that international innovation collaboration has promoted technology transfer and knowledge spillover between countries. The conclusion of various international intellectual property (IP) treaties has played an essential role in optimizing the international innovation and collaboration environment. This study investigates the effect of IP treaties on international innovation collaboration and whether international IP treaties can promote collaboration between a country and other economies in the world. Design/methodology/approach After collecting and extracting the patent record data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), a final dataset of 3,213,626 cooperative patents and 465,236 pairs of collaborations between two countries or regions is established. Based on the international patent collaboration data of 192 countries during 1976-2017, the changes in patent collaboration indicators after these countries joined 23 IP treaties are analyzed. Findings International IP treaties have significantly increased the number of patent cooperation countries of a country and its importance in international cooperation networks. The role of IP treaties is more manifested by the increased opportunities for a country's international innovation cooperation than its influence on global innovation; this is of extreme significance for developing countries to introduce advanced technologies. Originality/value Ginarte and Park (1997) have confirmed that IP treaties have helped to raise the level of IP protection. In this study, the increase in the degree centrality of the international innovation network is evidence of IP treaties to promote innovation cooperation.

Taking stock of a long-term empirical evidence on the pharmaceutical sector in the US, we can hardly support IPRs intended as an innovation rewarding institution. According to our analysis, pharma patents have constituted legal barriers to protect intellectual monopolies rather than an incentive and a reward to innovative efforts. Patenting strategies appear to be quite aggressive in extending knowledge borders and enlarging the space protected from the possibility of infringement. This is also witnessed by the fact that patent applications are very skewed in the covered trade names and patent thickness expands over time. Conversely, the ratio of patents protecting new drugs approved by the FDA which draw upon government-sponsored research - as such, a mark for quality - falls.

Early Certainty in patent cases involving by opposition proceedings,Quality; EPO; Legal status; Opposition; Examination; QUALITY,"To obtain certainty about the validity and enforceability of a patent one has to go to court for a ruling. It is very important for patent owners and for their competitors to make decisions on product development based upon assumptions about the validity and enforceability of patents before it reaches court. If you are in court after developing a product then something went wrong in that process. An opposition at the EPO seems to be a good idea to test the arguments of invalidity, if you are a third party worried about the scope of the patent. If an opposition is filed against a patent then the time taken until a final decision gives additional uncertainty about the scope of patent protection and may diversely affect what you may or may not do in any national proceedings. The additional time period of uncertainty caused by EPO opposition procedures is explored in this study and compared with the expected time for nullity actions at a national court, exemplified for the German patent court.",2020,Information Science & Library Science,0

This article addresses this lacuna, examining the legal, commercial, and ethical implications of patenting de-extinct animals under European patent law. The article is organized into four parts. Part I explores the reasons why patents are relevant and may be applied for in this context. Part II provides an overview of the scientific techniques currently being used in de-extinction projects, setting the foundation for the analysis of patentability which follows. Part III then critically assesses whether recreated animals would qualify as patent eligible subject matter under European patent law. It also investigates the extent to which European patent exclusions such as those on animal varieties, essentially biological processes, and the morality provisions might apply and whether recreated animals would meet the novelty requirement for patentability. Part IV concludes by highlighting the possible ramifications of patenting such animals, elucidating the chasm between the cultural and symbolic significance held by such animals, and their lack of differential treatment in the patent law sphere. It argues that de-extinction reignites questions around the scope of patents, and the role of ethical considerations within patent decision-making which warrant urgent reconsideration.",2021,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,0
How to Maximize the Patent Value: Base on the Patent Trust in Taiwan,Patent Licensing; Patent Financing; Trust of Patent; Invention Patent; ,"As knowledge-based economy is developing in the global environment, knowledge innovation changes quickly and dramatically. Related technology, management and legal protection mechanism based on intellectual property becomes the core competence of the company. The mechanism of maximizing patent value is not only effective for patentee to raise fund to fulfill the strong funding demand used in research and development (R&D) , but also motivates the R&D worker and improve the patent quality, which drives the industry development and increases core competence of nation. It is pity that the majority of patentees are R&D workers who specializes in developing new technology, but have rare understanding about patent maintenance and how to exercise patent right, not to mention how to maximize the patent value, including transference of patent right, patent licensing, patent financing and other options about patent entitlement. Most of local high-tech companies in Taiwan are original equipment manufacturers (OEM) or original design manufacturers (ODM), therefore, they are not available to drive continuous innovative research and development for patent with large capital to obtain competitive advantage by patent right and seize the opportunity to maximize the patent value, which is the method international original brand manufacturers (OBM) adopted. In the framework of trust of Patent Act, this study adopts comparative research methodology to analyze trust of patent becomes the dilemma and potential opportunity when maximizing the patent value. Eventually, the study have some findings: 1. Patent term for pharmaceuticals is longer than that for other inventions, and that's why the competitiveness of trust of patent for pharmaceuticals is better than the trust of other inventions' patent. 2. The objective way to measure the value of patent right might depends on the evaluation purpose. After calculating individual patent value, then transforming the different types of intellectual properties into the various trust equities categorized by the patent evaluation purposes, and trust equities might be an option when making decision for investors. Briefly speaking, taking advantage of the characteristic of patent and working with financial system to make trust of patent have much more market-based incentives would make the trust of patent as an opportunity rather than a dilemma for maximizing the patent value.",2021,Government & Law,0
Commercialisation of Intellectual Property: A Comparative Analysis of Georgia and Estonia,Georgia's and Estonia's legislative frameworks in IP commercialisation; intellectual property; IP commercialisation; INNOVATION,"Commercialisation of intellectual property (IP) constitutes a vital part of a state's economy and signifi cantly contributes to the development and success of any innovative project. At the same time, commercialisation of IP is directly linked to the adopted legislation on patent rights as it regulates the protection and exploitation of IP. This article seeks to compare the IP commercialisation frameworks in Georgia and Estonia and identify the challenges encountered in patent protection mechanisms in Georgia. Estonia and Georgia are both located in the Eastern European region and share similar legal systems and constitutions. By aligning its legislative framework with European Union standards and supporting universities and fostering a culture of innovation, Estonia sets a notable example in IP commercialisation. However, Georgia's legislative framework still lacks certain elements that are crucial for developing IP commercialisation. The low number of registered patent applications in Georgia indicates the challenges and obstacles in this fi eld. The comparison of legal frameworks and practices in these countries can provide important insights into the challenges and solutions in IP commercialisation. The article examines how inefficient legislative framework leads to inconsistent patent protection mechanisms in Georgia, creating barriers in IP commercialisation, while underlining Estonia's success in innovation and the establishment of a progressive IP commercialisation landscape.The article also presents a set of recommendations for Georgia to align its framework with EU standards, initiating joining the European Patent Convention, strengthening IP enforcement, and promoting open IP policies in universities, following Estonia's model.",2024,Government & Law,0

As firms' exposure to cybersecurity risk increases, managers' reliance on trade secrets declines, as they seek to protect their firms' intellectual capital under the umbrella provided by patent and intellectual property laws. In particular, we document that firms exposed to cyber threats file for simpler patents to accelerate their innovation cycle. This strategic adjustment is not costless, as it causes firms' returns to research and development (R & D) investments to decline significantly.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Does intellectual property rights protection affect UK and US outward FDI and earnings from FDI? A sectoral analysis,Intellectual property rights; Patents; Foreign direct investment; Multinationals; C23; F21; F23; O34; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION; IMPACT; DETERMINANTS; INNOVATION; COUNTRIES,"Purpose Despite decades of research, the relationship between intellectual property rights (IPRs) and foreign direct investment (FDI) remains ambiguous. Using a recently developed patent enforcement index (along with a broader IPR index) and a large sectoral country-to-country FDI dataset, the authors revisit the FDI-IPR relationship by testing the impact of IPRs on UK and US outward FDI (OFDI) flows as well as earnings from outward FDI (EOFDI). Design/methodology/approach The authors use disaggregated data for up to 9 distinct sectors of economic activity from both the US and UK for OFDI flows and EOFDI, for a panel of up to 42 developed and developing countries over sample periods from 1998 to 2015. The authors employ a panel fixed effects (FE) approach that allows exploiting the longitudinal properties of the data using Driscoll and Kraay's (1998) nonparametric covariance matrix estimator. Findings The authors do not find any consistent evidence in support of the hypothesis that countries' strength of IPR protection or enforcement affects inward FDI, or that sector of investment matters. The results prove robust to sensitivity checks that include an alternative broader measure of IPR strength, analyses across sub-samples disaggregated according to the strength of countries' IPRs as well as developing vs developed economies and an extended specification accounting for dynamic effects of the response of FDI to both previous investment levels and IPR (patent) protection. Originality/value The authors make use of the largest most granular sectoral country-to-country FDI dataset employed to date in the analysis of the FDI-IPR nexus with disaggregated data for OFDI and EOFDI across up to 9 distinct sectors of economic activity from both the US and UK The authors employ a more sophisticated measure of IPR strength, the patent index proposed by Papageorgiadis et al. (2014), which places emphasis on the effectiveness of enforcement practices as perceived by managers, together with the overall administrative effectiveness and efficiency of the national patent system.",2022,Business & Economics,0

Given the large scale and fast growth in international patent filings, understanding the motivations of international patenting behaviors has attracted much attention. This study extends prior literature by exploring additional important determinants of international patenting behaviors and the heterogeneity in international patenting across technology and assignee categories. This study focuses on the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry, which is a major sector in the renewable energy industry and plays a key role in achieving energy transition. As a critical application for semiconductors, PV technologies have grown into a substantial field of research and development through strong patents. In this study, we found that the quality and applicability scope of a patent, as well as the market size, manufacturing capacity, and imitation threats in a destination country, can impact international patent extensions in the solar PV industry. We also found that the strength of these motivators varies based on different types of technologies and assignees.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,0
The Problems with Trade Secret Protection/Overprotection in Asia,Trade secrets; Non-competition; Economic espionage; Mobility; Breach of confidence; PRINCIPLE; EQUALITY; ARMS,"Trade secret protection law has been an important complement to patent law and has gained increasing importance over the last three decades, not least in Asia. Major Asian countries are now at a crossroads, as some (Japan, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and China) are following the US approach to criminalizing trade secret infringement and imposing harsher penalties on economic espionage (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China). This paper identifies many of the problems associated with trade secret protection, provides indicators of the overprotection of trade secrets, and warns against its many side effects. It then points out the crossroads that Asian economies are now at and provides some suggestions for Asian jurisdictions to consider: basing trade secret protection on commercial realities, working trade secret protection in tandem with the patent regime, and learning from the German model of moderate criminal punishment for trade secret infringement and protecting employee mobility by limiting non-competition clauses.",2022,Government & Law,0
Patent network analysis in agriculture: a case study of the development and protection of biotechnologies,Genetically modified organisms; patent citation networks; technological trajectories; intellectual property; patent litigation; MAPPING TECHNOLOGICAL TRAJECTORIES; INNOVATION; CITATIONS; PATTERNS; GROWTH,"Plant biotechnology has consolidated itself as a radical agricultural innovation, boosting the patenting activities of universities, biotechnology firms, and seed & agrochemicals corporations. We use patent citations networks to study the appropriability efforts that affected the emergence and dynamics of the technological trajectories (TTs) of the genetically modified organisms. Our methodological contribution consists of combining new procedures to identify TTs with the study of the characteristics of scale-free networks. This paper also proposes legal enforcement indicators that attempt to assess the economic importance of patents that make up citation networks. We identify two TTs that include patents on biotech traits and enabling technologies. These patents were both effective in collecting royalties from farmers and deterring potential entrants, particularly through intellectual property (IP) litigation. The results also show that these litigated patents have impacted merger and acquisition activity in seed industry. We conclude that IP lawsuits may have contributed to delaying the R&D investments of new entrants, thus preserving the monopolistic position enjoyed by the pioneering company and restricting the scope of crop innovations.",2021,Business & Economics,0
Global R&D Collaboration in the Development of Nanotechnology: The Impact of R&D Collaboration Patterns on Patent Quality,patent quality; global research and development (R&D) collaboration; nanotechnology; UNIVERSITY; PERSPECTIVE; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; UK,"Nanotechnologies have been regarded as general-purpose, and interdisciplinary technology converged with different implications of technologies. This paper aims to explore the global Nano collaboration of research and development (R&D) by patent analysis to realize the sustainable development of nanotechnology and investigate the influence of global R&D collaboration on patent quality. The primary findings indicated that the number of issued patents grew sharply since 2002, and the major collaborative fields in terms of nanotechnology are nanoelectronic and nanomaterials. Finally, the collaboration among star assigners, global partnership, and the indicator of patent centrality had a positive impact on patent quality, except that university-industry collaboration did not show a significant effect on patent quality. One part of the reason is that industries have not yet fully recognised nanotechnology opportunities with a risk-averse attitude toward market uncertainties. Overall, the relationship of global R&D collaboration is an essential factor in promoting the sustainable development of the patent quality of nanotechnology. An effective patenting strategy and high-quality application of nanotechnology R&D could secure protection for innovations to reinforce core competitiveness in the business.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

This paper examines the evolution and dynamics of international patenting networks (IPNs) using data on cross-border patent grants from the World Intellectual Property Organization database. Employing social network analysis and a quadratic assignment procedure (QAP), the study analyzes IPNs from 1995 to 2020. The findings reveal a significant globalization of patents, with a shift in the centers of gravity for outward-bound international patenting from the West to the East. The IPNs exhibit a small-world phenomenon, illustrating the interconnectedness and efficiency of patent flows globally. Asian countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, have gained increasing importance in patenting activities, reflecting the evolving landscape of economic globalization. However, a few countries still dominate worldwide patent activity, leading to an asymmetrical international patent relationship between high-income (HI) countries and non-HI countries. Developed countries serve as expanders, while developing countries primarily act as absorbers of patented technologies. QAP analysis indicates that trade, institutional, language, and technological proximities were all found to contribute to the formation of outward-bound IPNs, while political and economic proximities had varying effects. Surprisingly, geographical proximity exhibits a counterintuitive positive effect. These findings provide important implications for international economic policy.",2024,Engineering; Business & Economics,0

The intellectual property rights (IPR) regime as it exists does not optimize the global flow of technology and know-how for the attainment of the sustainable development goals and is in need of updating. Some features of the Fourth Industrial Revolution imply that the current system of patents is even more in need of reform than before. COVID-19 vaccines and therapies and the vast inequality in access to these has highlighted the costs of inaction. We recommend several policy changes for the international IPR regime. Broadly, these fall into three categories: allowing greater flexibility for developing countries, reassessing the appropriate- ness of patents for technologies that may be considered public goods, and closing loopholes that allow for unreasonable intellectual property protections.",2023,Public Administration,0

Key characteristics are that patent citations are aggregated by patent family, and that not all citations are considered equal. To each family citation a weight is assigned that is proportional to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the countries in which protection is requested, to take into account the costs and expected benefits of patenting, and inversely proportional to the number of cited references in a patent family, as a way to correct for differences in citation frequencies in patent applications among technological fields. Around one third of journals indexed in Scopus have at least one citation from patent applications in a 5-year citation window. The distribution of the technological impact scores among journals can be modelled as a power law distribution, with the slope being a little smoother than that of common scientific impact indicators SJR and JIF. However, the correlations between technological and scientific impact indicators are mostly low or moderate, which shows that they measure quite different aspects of journal or research performance.",2021,Communication; Information Science & Library Science,0
What do firms gain from patenting?

We exploit matched financial accounts and patent grants in 2009-2017 by 179,660 companies in 39 countries. Preliminarily, we find that less than 2% of larger firms are responsible for 89% of the grants. We propose a quasi-experimental strategy that first controls for reverse causality and then separates the impact of IPR protection from the innovative content of inventions making use of exogenous variation at the patent offices. We find that patents have a considerable impact on market shares and the size of smaller companies (31.7% and 30.7%, respectively) in the first year after the grants, which is mainly due to IPR protection. Most of the bigger firms' gains fade away after controlling for reverse causality and endogeneity. Notably, we never observe a direct impact on profitability for any firm size category. Eventually, we argue that IPR reform proposals should consider firms' heterogeneity and improve IPR access for smaller companies to enhance competition.",2024,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0
The impact of the new environmental protection law on eco-innovation: evidence from green patent data of Chinese listed companies,New Environmental Protection Law; Eco-innovation; Difference-in-difference; Policy evaluation; ,"Innovation is an imperative way of harmonizing the relationship between environmental protection and economic growth. Reasonably creating institutional pressure to stimulate the innovation vitality of enterprises is a crucial issue in promoting the modernization of ecological environment governance systems and governance capacity. This paper considered China's new environmental protection law (NEPL) as a quasi-natural experiment to evaluate the impact of environmental regulation on enterprise eco-innovation in a difference-in-difference (DID) framework. It also identifies the conditions of the NEPL that encourage enterprise eco-innovation. We found that the NEPL significantly hinders the level of enterprise eco-innovation. This inhibition is mainly associated with invention patents with high degrees of innovation rather than utility model patents, resulting from tightening financing constraints. Further, when considering enterprise heterogeneity in terms of ownership, size, and cost transfer ability, private and small-sized enterprises and enterprises with higher cost transfer ability are more affected by the implementation of the NEPL. Furthermore, enterprises with a better business environment are more likely to perform innovation activities. Our findings have valuable implications for evaluating the effects of policy implementation more scientifically and comprehensively, and consequently, promoting the innovation compensation effect of environmental regulation.",2022,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Temporal Trends in the United States Patent Landscape: Innovation in Cardiology Across Industry and Academia,Patent; Cardiology; Innovation; Temporal trends; ,"Background: Novel approaches to diagnostics and therapeutics in medical care reflect the scientific community's evolving understanding of disease states and their clinical implications. Marketable and valuable innovations are generally patented for protection of intellectual property. Here, we explore the landscape of cardiology-related patents in the United States.Methods: All United States patents granted between 2005 and 2020 were included in this study. Keywords filtering was used to identify patents related to cardiovascular medicine. Statistical inference was conducted with the Mann-Kendall trend and analysis of variance tests. The results in this report are entirely reproducible with Python and R scripts available in a publicly accessible repository.Results: Of the 4,453,733 patents issued by the USPTO between 2005 and 2020, 31,048 (0.7%) were identified as cardiology-related patents. We identified the top 10 institutions within the for-profit and not-for-profit categories that were assigned the most cardiology-related patents in this time period. Distributions of number of patents per inventor were heavily right-skewed, with a small number of inventors responsible for a large number of patents each. Patents in the cardiac imaging subgroup took the longest to gain approval after submission (median delay: 3.6 years). Conclusions: By studying the patent universe, we are able to identify underexplored areas within cardiovascular medicine. Obstacles such as long delays between patent application and approval can hamper innovation within a field. As a next step, we aim to use these results to predict the next area within cardiovascular medicine to undergoexplosive research and innovation.",2023,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,0

Using a panel dataset of 2908 companies from 2011 to 2020, we use textual analysis and entropy weighting on corporate annual reports to construct a yearly corporate digitalization index. Our findings show that corporate digitalization promotes green innovation, as evidenced by patent applications and grants. This relationship is stronger for firms with fewer financial constraints and in provinces with strong intellectual property protection. We also find the national digital policy of the Internet Plus strategy has a stronger positive effect on corporate green innovation for corporations with a higher degree of digitalization.

Data mining patented antibody sequences,Patents; data mining; therapeutic Antibodies; ,"The patent literature should reflect the past 30 years of engineering efforts directed toward developing monoclonal antibody therapeutics. Such information is potentially valuable for rational antibody design. Patents, however, are designed not to convey scientific knowledge, but to provide legal protection. It is not obvious whether antibody information from patent documents, such as antibody sequences, is useful in conveying engineering know-how, rather than as a legal reference only. To assess the utility of patent data for therapeutic antibody engineering, we quantified the amount of antibody sequences in patents destined for medicinal purposes and how well they reflect the primary sequences of therapeutic antibodies in clinical use. We identified 16,526 patent families covering major jurisdictions (e.g., US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and World Intellectual Property Organization) that contained antibody sequences. These families held 245,109 unique antibody chains (135,397 heavy chains and 109,712 light chains) that we compiled in our Patented Antibody Database (PAD, ). We find that antibodies make up a non-trivial proportion of all patent amino acid sequence depositions (e.g., 11% of USPTO Full Text database). Our analysis of the 16,526 families demonstrates that the volume of patent documents with antibody sequences is growing, with the majority of documents classified as containing antibodies for medicinal purposes. We further studied the 245,109 antibody chains from patent literature to reveal that they very well reflect the primary sequences of antibody therapeutics in clinical use. This suggests that the patent literature could serve as a reference for previous engineering efforts to improve rational antibody design.",2021,Research & Experimental Medicine,0
Impact of patent rights on innovation: A meta-analysis,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PROTECTION; LEVEL,"Research shows that the enforcement of patent rights (PRs) play a significant role in countries' innovation and technological development.

This study intends to test whether the findings are sensitive to various measures employed and identify possible policy implications across countries. Our analysis suggests that certain aspects of measuring innovation are crucial in explaining the significance of these findings. This study finds that countries' strength in PRs plays a significant role in determining its innovation. We also find that there is a distinction in PRs' contribution to domestic innovation across developed and developing countries in the existing primary studies.",2020,Public Administration,0

We show that under reasonable conditions (such as the government's inability to customise the tax rate for each firm), patent protection is preferable to a tax/subsidy scheme if the marginal costs of the imitators are sufficiently higher than that of the innovator. Otherwise, the tax/subsidy scheme is preferable. These results hold under Cournot and Bertrand competition with product differentiation, but not for the case of Bertrand competition with homogeneous products. We rationalise these findings as the results of a trade-off between the distortions induced by monopoly under patents and production inefficiency under the tax/subsidy scheme.",2021,Business & Economics,0

While a patent filed by government scientists decreases the rate of follow-on patents in a technological area that overlaps with the areas of the focal patent, it increases the rate of follow-on patents in non-overlapping technological areas. The increase in follow-on inventions is attributed to risk-taking inventions, that is, inventions involve a high chance of resulting in either impactful or failure patents, rather than incremental inventions. It is also characterized by inventions with a high level of originality. Inventors in distant locations in terms of geographical and technological proximity are most affected by the patents filed by government scientists. The patent effect is pronounced when the government scientists involved in the focal discovery have fewer social connections and when the scientific field is less familiar in the industry. These findings are consistent with the idea that patenting by government scientists helps facilitate the dissemination of technological information or potential of scientific discoveries in government laboratories. Policy and managerial implications are also discussed.",2022,Business & Economics,0

However, the increasing size of patent information as well as the inherent fuzziness of patent infringement risk make the early warning of this risk a knowledge-intensive engineering activity. In this study, a novel patent infringement early warning methodology based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) is proposed to accurately evaluate and classify patent infringement risk for its management. First, a hierarchical indicator system of the methodology is established, including indicators of regional judicial and administrative protection. Then entropy weights for IFSs and intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric (IFWG) operators are utilized to objectively and automatically aggregate indicator data on early warning patents and their similar patents to evaluate IFS results, which is a multi-layer data processing structure. Finally, the normalized Euclidean distances are used to classify risk levels. In a case study, Huawei's historical patents are taken as the test data, and the methodology is verified by comparing the output results and classification with the actual litigation status. Managerial implications for design engineers and patent attorneys are discussed corresponding to various technological innovation stages.",2022,Computer Science; Engineering,0

Patent citation is a new and informative signal. We hope this signal can help auditors reduce the lack of professional knowledge and reduce the audit input of innovation quality. By examining Chinese non-financial firms between 2011 and 2019, we use patent citation as the proxy of patent quality and find that firms with higher patent quality have lower audit input at the same level of R&D expenditure. Further tests show that the signaling effect of patent quality is limited. Patent quality signals will work when the audited firm is a high-tech enterprise, or when the Key Audit Matters (KAMs) involve items such as R&D expenditures. But the auditor industry specialization can replace the influence of patent quality. Our results imply that auditors can use patent quality as a signal to reduce the difficulty of obtaining information and risk evaluation. Firms should focus on the quality of patents and display their innovation capabilities through the intellectual property (IP) market. China should strengthen the protection of private rights and continuously enhance the supporting mechanism of IP market.",2022,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,0

Theoretically grounded in the awareness-motivation-capability framework of competitive dynamics, this article contributes to the literature on patent strategy and international market entry by looking at how, in a complex product industry, the intensity of patent litigation in a country affects a firm's decision to enter that country. Our results show that the intensity of patent litigation in a country is a deterrent for potential entrants and has a negative effect on a firm's likelihood of entering that country. We also show that a firm's previous experience with patent litigation (awareness component), the share of a firm's current patent applications in a target country (motivation component), and the size of a firm's patent stock (capability component) moderate the relationship between a country's patent litigation intensity and a firm's likelihood of entering that country. We thus shed light on the joint effect of macro- and micro-level patent-related variables on a firm's market entry decisions.

Based on detailed price data, our difference-in-differences estimates imply that design protection increases prices by about 5-8%, with large differences between carmakers. We then link our findings to the literature on deviations from the law of one price. We document large cross-country price deviations for identical spare parts and provide evidence that a part of these price devia-tions can be explained by the lack of harmonization of design protection in combination with carmakers' pricing-to-market strategies.

Therefore, an analysis of which source disclosure model is applicable to the patent protection of genetic resources is ofgreat importance. The economic approach ofgame theory is used to analyse the game of interests between patent applicants and the patent examination authority. It is found that the patent examination authority is required to introduce source disclosure rules and that the optimal equilibrium for patent applications can be achieved by requiring companies to comply with a voluntary source disclosure model under intense examination pressure. Based on this, the legislative policies of typical resource-rich countries are selected for analysis to verify the validity of the game conclusions. Finally, policy recommendations for source disclosure requirements for genetic resources in China are proposed based on the game conclusions.",2023,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,0
Patentology of chitinous biomaterials. Part II: chitosan,Biomaterials; Chitin; Chitosan; Patent; Patentology; NANOPARTICLES,"Cationic chitosan is recognized as the most widely studied derivative of chitin, one of the main and the most evolutionary ancient structural biopolymer in nature. The multi-functionality of chitosan, due to its specific physicochemical properties, biodegradability and biocompatibility, is a fundamental factor in the patentability of this biopolymer in diverse fields of modern science and technology. It is shown that the chitosan-related patents were categorized mainly under biomedical, material science, biotechnology, and chemical directions; while a very small portion of the patents were mentioned under food, cosmetics, environmental protection, and agri-cultural fields. For the first time, the review provides a detailed analysis on the background and scope of the patents reported on chitosan so far.",2023,Chemistry; Polymer Science,0
Determinants of innovation outcomes: The role of institutional quality,Innovation; Institutions; Patent enforcement; Unconditional quantile regression; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; DOMESTIC INNOVATION; NATIONAL SYSTEMS; COUNTRIES; IMPACT,"This paper uses unconditional quantile regression analysis to interrogate the effects of institutional quality on innovation outcomes. We assess important determinants of innovation such as property rights (including enforcement of intellectual property rights), human resources within R&D and high-technology exports. Regarding intellectual property rights, while most previous research focuses on patent strength (de jure or book law), we focus on de facto patent enforcement. Using data from the World Bank, the Heritage Foundation and a new patent enforcement index, we construct a panel of fifty countries covering 1998-2017. Our analysis reveals important new insights including the strongly negative impact of patent enforcement and human resources within R&D on less innovative economies, and the varying impacts across quantiles for key variables such as high-technology exports. We find that both stronger institutions and patent enforcement are not necessarily the best route to boosting innovation, especially in economies where existing innovative capacity is weak",2022,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,0
"Tacit knowledge, localization push, and diffusion of science: Evidence from Singapore",tacit knowledge; basic research; localization; knowledge diffusion; Singapore; PATENT CITATIONS; TRIPLE-HELIX; SPILLOVERS; GEOGRAPHY; INNOVATION; FLOWS; US,"We propose localization push, as an alternative to tacit knowledge, to explain the localization of knowledge diffusion. Sponsors of scientific research enact policies and create institutions for locally-produced knowledge spillovers. We hypothesize that localization necessitated by tacit knowledge renders the local diffusion of such knowledge more productive than distant commercialization. However, this is not the case when the localization push is the primary reason for the localization. We empirically investigate the hypothesis using data on knowledge diffusion in SingaporeOur main findings are as follows: (1) The diffusion of basic research, measured by journal articles cited in patents, is localized, but this is almost exclusively accounted for by Singaporean public institutions; (2) Local patents citing papers authored by Singaporeans are less significant than foreign patents citing such papers; and (3) Singaporean public patent applicants are more willing to seek multijurisdiction patent protection despite the ineffectiveness of their commercialization efforts.",2021,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,0

We find that lenders construct stricter contracts for firms filing more patents, consistent with lenders imposing more oversight on firms when they enter the commercialization stage after having demonstrated their inventiveness. Our results hold under propensity score matching and entropy balancing, and when exploiting the American Inventors Protection Act as a shock affecting unrelated banks' access to patent filing information. The relationship we document is stronger when the lender has more expertise and for firms with higher default risk. We demonstrate that borrowers' patent filings are associated with more future R&D and capital investment and with a higher likelihood of their acquiring firms in the industry of their patent filings. Our results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that lenders interpret patent filings as indicative of high inventive potential that requires stricter discipline and oversight by lenders in order to be converted into actual business success, and with them designing debt contract terms accordingly.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Study on the Technological Inductive Effects of Product Information Label: Evidence From the Energy-Efficiency Labeling System in China,product information label; energy efficiency labeling system; technological progress; patent data; INNOVATION; POLICIES; GROWTH,"Under the dual goals of achieving carbon peak and carbon neutralization, it is of great practical significance to explore the impact of product information labeling on technological innovation. As an essential element in improving energy performance in consumer products, energy-efficiency labels (EEL) have played a vital role in the government's portfolio of energy-efficiency improvement, technological progress, and carbon emission mitigation. We estimate the extent of the inductive effects of varying patent types on the relationship between the EEL system and technological innovation in a panel differences-in-differences framework based on the panel data of energy-saving patents and electricity-saving patents from 1998 to 2013 in China. Results indicate that the EEL system helps firms improve the ratio of energy-saving and electricity-saving patents to water-saving patents, and the rate of energy-saving and electricity-saving patents to all patents in the region. In another word, the EEL has a significant directed technological inducing effect. As for the role of the heterogeneity of patent types, the positive effects of the EEL system on invention patents are significantly suppressed in patent-for-utility models. Thus, it is suggested to improve the existing EEL system, gradually expand the product coverage of the EEL system, and increase the protection scope of utility model patents for achieving technological progress and sustainable development of society.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics,0
Quick or Broad Patents? Evidence from US Startups,D23; G24; L26; O34; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; SCOPE; PROTECTION; QUALITY; POLICY,"We study the effects of patent scope and review times on startups and externalities on their rivals. We leverage the quasi-random assignment of U.S. patent applications to examiners and find that grant delays reduce a startup's employment and sales growth, chances of survival, access to external capital, and future innovation. Delays also harm the growth, access to external capital, and follow-on innovation of the patentee's rivals, suggesting that quick patents enhance both inventor rewards and generate positive externalities. Broader scope increases a startup's future growth (conditional on survival) and innovation but imposes negative externalities on its rivals' growth and innovation.",2022,Business & Economics,0
"R&D, patents, and financing constraints of the top global innovative firms",Financing constraints; Firm innovation; Patents; R&D; PANEL-DATA; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS; CASH FLOW; EQUITY; SENSITIVITY; PROTECTION; SIGNALS; IMPACT,"Highly innovative firms face unique financing constraints because there is often a greater degree of information asymmetry between firms and potential lenders. Prior literature indicates that patents provide a quality signal to external investors that potentially help mitigate internal liquidity constraints. In this paper, we study the joint impact of firms' patent stocks and operating profit margin, which acts as a proxy for internal funds, on R&D expenditures in a panel of the top 20 0 0 corporate R&D performers worldwide. We find that patenting activity lessens the impact of negative internal liquidity shocks on innovation for relatively smaller firms. In contrast, patenting activity does not have an attenuating effect for relatively larger firms. The results are consistent for high and medium-high technology firms and are robust to country specific controls.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Patents and gender: a contextual analysis,patent law; knowledge governance; gender; women; STEM; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SCIENCE; WOMEN; FEMINISM; LAW; TECHNOLOGY; ECONOMICS; INVENTION; EQUALITY,"Patent law is considered to be an objective law, dealing with the objective subject matter of the 'technical arts'. Yet, empirical studies show that patenting rates around the world are gendered. This article analyses the roots of the gender patent gap, and how this correlates to the invention and innovation processes. It shows that the gendered nature of the patent-regulated knowledge governance system forces women into traditionally male spaces and fields in order to partake in the extant patent game. Yet, when they enter those spaces and fields, they often find themselves unwelcome and subject to institutional, structural or organizational biases, which impinge upon their ability to invent, patent and commercialize. This article re-frames the discourse around women inventors. It argues that we have to stop focusing on the 'women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)' narrative, because it is a distraction from the underlying problem that the Western knowledge governance system reflects the hegemonic powers at play. Instead, we need to re-think the knowledge governance system and the ecosystem it creates, in order to ensure egalitarian knowledge production and protection.",2020,Government & Law,0
From Innovation to Standardization: Unraveling the Impact of R&D Strategies on Standard-Setting Processes,Patent indicators; standard essential patents (SEPs); technological innovation; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PATENT LITIGATION; KNOWLEDGE; MARKET; PERFORMANCE; SPEED; DETERMINANTS; DIVERSITY; CITATION,"The unprecedented proliferation of standard-essential patents (SEPs) has exerted a transformative impact on the evolution of standards, fueling global technological innovation. Recognized as a linchpin for enabling rapid and widespread innovation diffusion, SEPs have become pivotal drivers of contemporary business strategies. While the superior value of SEPs vis-a-vis non-standard-essential patents (non-SEPs) is widely acknowledged, the intricate process underlying the transformation of patents into SEPs warrants a comprehensive investigation. Drawing on an extensive analysis of 4859 SEPs and 775 669 non-SEPs granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office from 1976 to 2014, this study employs a rigorous examination of ten commonly utilized patent indicators, delineating four critical dimensions: 1) collaboration, 2) knowledge, 3) diversity, and 4) legal protection. Through a strategic lens, this study shed light on the multifaceted factors that amplify the likelihood and hasten the speed of SEP declarations. The empirical findings of this study compellingly illustrate the predominantly positive influence exerted by most indicators on SEP declaration likelihood, effectively expediting the declaration process.",2024,Business & Economics; Engineering,0
The innovation consequences of mandatory patent disclosures,Patent disclosure; Innovation; Spillovers; Proprietary costs; Corporate disclosure; PUBLICATION; PROPRIETARY; INFORMATION; DIFFUSION; ECONOMICS; SHOULDERS; GIANTS; MARKET,"We investigate the effect of patent disclosures on corporate innovation. Using the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA) as a shock that increased patent disclosures, we find an increase in innovation for firms whose rivals reveal more information after the AIPA and a decrease in innovation for firms whose own disclosures are divulged to competitors as a result of the law. These findings suggest patent disclosures generate both spillover benefits and proprietary costs. Our findings provide justification for patent disclosure requirements by demonstrating positive externalities: rivals' disclosures facilitate a firm's innovation. However, we also highlight that mandatory patent disclosures can impose proprietary costs on firms. These results broadly contribute to our understanding of the real effects of disclosure, such that forcing firms to share proprietary information can be privately costly but beneficial to other firms.& nbsp; (C)& nbsp;2020 The Authors.

Access to Pharmaceutical Patents in the COVID-19 Emergency: A Case for Government Use in Nigeria,Pharmaceutical patent; public health; COVID-19 vaccines; compulsory licence; government use; Patents and Designs Act; ,"The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to exert enormous pressure on public health policies and systems, with far-reaching implications. The race for vaccines has raised important intellectual property rights issues. These are evident in the need to advance the public interest and in the obligation of governments to address the challenge of access to vaccines, especially in sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria with relatively underdeveloped healthcare and innovation ecosystems. While the Nigerian Patents and Designs Act (PDA) establishes a compulsory licence regime that affords access to patented drugs, existing public healthcare is severely challenged in providing access to new medicines. This article examines the framework for patent protection of pharmaceuticals designed to meet public health challenges, such as those presented by the pandemic. It recommends the implementation of a government use provision under the PDA, with a view to addressing the challenge of access to COVID-19 vaccines.",2021,Government & Law,0
Reaching for mediocrity: Competition and stagnation in pharmaceutical innovation,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INCENTIVES; PATENTS,"We model how risk-neutral firms' ability to obtain substantial private returns on marginal new tech-nologies causes them to reach for mediocrity by investing in socially suboptimal projects, even in the presence of competition and new entrants. Focusing primarily on pharmaceutical innovation, we analyze various policy interventions to solve this underinvestment problem. In particular, we describe a new approach for a value-based patent system, which ties patent protection to an underlying invention's social value, and we show how such a system could incentivize socially optimal innovation.

BETWEEN SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS: ADDRESSING SOFTWARE PATENT ELIGIBILITY IN EARLY-STAGE LITIGATION,; ,"The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International established a two-step inquiry for determining the eligibility of a patent claim for protection. The test has faced criticism for its inconsistency, particularly when evaluating software-related patents. These inconsistencies are exacerbated when the test is applied during the early stages of litigation to address motions made under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(c), as the test often requires an in-depth technical analysis of the claims.First, this Note examines the current approach to software patent eligibility and the various points of inconsistencies and tension. This Note then argues that incorporating claim construction-the process of interpreting patent claims from the perspective of someone skilled in the relevant field-into the pleadings stage can help litigants identify factual disputes and avoid making premature technical decisions.",2023,Government & Law,0
Big Data Analytics for Venture Capital Application : Towards Innovation Performance Improvement,Data panel model; Big data; Innovation performance; INVESTMENT; COMPLEMENTARITY; BEHAVIOR; GROWTH; FIRMS,"By using the panel date of Chinese enterprises, this paper analyzes the influence of venture capital on innovation performance. In this paper, the number of patent application and the patent quality(invention patent applications, number of effective patents, IPC number of international patent classification, and patent claims) are used to measure the innovation performance of enterprises, and the regression results show that the innovation performance is significantly promoted by the venture capital; for industries with higher dependence on external financing and high technology intensity and areas with better protection of property rights, venture capital promotes innovation performance more significantly. In this paper, it further distinguishes the characteristics of venture capital institutions, and finds that the promotion effect of non-state-owned venture capital on innovation performance is significantly greater than that of state-owned venture capital; the venture capital institutions with high reputation and high network capital play a more significant role in promoting innovation performance.",2020,Information Science & Library Science,0
Patenting trends in the mining industry,Patent families; Foreign-oriented families; Patent family size; INNOVATION,"This article focuses on patenting in the mining sector during the period of 1970-2018. Information from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) mining database allows studying innovation trends of mining technologies, where the unit of interest is patent families. The latter are classified by filing year, applicant's origin, entity type (i.e., companies, educational institutions, research centers, and individuals), intellectual protection type, and patent family size. The evidence shows: (i) only a small percentage of families is foreign-oriented, suggesting a limited international scope of mining inventions. (ii) Most families are first filed within the same geographic region of origin. (iii) The mining innovation surge, starting in the mid-2000s, has been driven, in absolute terms, by Chinese companies, individuals, and educational institutions. However, China's relative specialization in mining has consistently decreased over time, in contrast with that of Australia and the Russia Federation. And, (iv) mining firms rely heavily on service providers' inventions, particularly in what regards to mine operation and mineral processing.",2021,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
"The interplay between innovation, standards and regulation in a globalising economy",Innovation; R&D; Patents; Regulation; Standardization; Globalization; PRODUCT MARKET REGULATION; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; TRADE; IMPACT; PATENTS; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; GOVERNANCE; MOTIVES,"To examine the different roles of regulation and standards in the age of globalisation, we hypothesize and investigate the relation of regulation and national and international standards on the one hand with innovation input (R&D expenditure) and innovation output (patents) on the other hand. The analysis is based on data of 26 high-income countries between 1998 and 2018. There are two main results. Firstly, international standards outperform both de-regulation and national standardisation as they are positively associated with R&D expenditure and patenting. On the other hand, national standards - once believed a source of competitiveness - are negatively related to patents and hence seem to localize economies and slow-down innovation. Secondly, deregulation does not correlate positively with R&D expenditure, but with increased patenting. We argue the former suggest businesses did not - as assumed - spend freed up resources on R&D, but instead strategically used patenting to replace lost regulation-based protection with patent fences. This casts doubts on the added social value of de-regulation induced innovation.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Dapagliflozin Formate Decision of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea 2 February 2023-Case No. 2022Hu10210,Person of ordinary skill in the art; Components listed in the claims; Equivalent infringement; Convenience of composition change; Trial for confirmation of the scope of patent right; Scope of protection; ,"Even when the components listed in the claims and the corresponding components of the allegedly infringing product are not the same in the literal sense, if they are evaluated to be in an equivalent relationship, they are considered to fall within the scope of protection, and infringement is thus acknowledged. Considering the purpose of recognising equivalent infringement, it is reasonable to conclude that materials published between the filling of the patent application and the infringement can be taken into account when determining the convenience of composition change. The trial for confirmation of the scope of patent right is not a procedure to definitively determine the legal relationship between the parties to a dispute, nor is the judgment of the trial binding on the infringement lawsuit. If there are any changes in the composition of the invention to be confirmed compared to that described in the claims of the patented invention, it is possible to determine whether the changes are such that an ordinary person skilled in the art can easily conceive of it by referring to the materials published after the application of the patented invention, but before the time of the trial judgment. It is not sufficient to conclude that all components existing between the pre- and post-reduction structures have been intentionally excluded from the claimed scope based solely on the fact that a reduction in the claimed scope occurred during the application process. Instead, a comprehensive analysis of various factors is required. When determining whether an invention to be confirmed falls within the scope of protection of the patented invention, each constituent element described in the claims of the patented invention must be included entirely in the invention subject to confirmation, along with the integral interrelationship among these constituent elements.",2024,Government & Law,0
Patent law harmonization and international trade,Intellectual property rights; Patent law; Gravity model; Bilateral trade; F14; F15; O34; TECHNOLOGY; PROTECTION; VARIETY; GRAVITY; RIGHTS; IMPACT,"Global harmonization of intellectual property rights (IPR) system is one of the major challenges in multilateral or regional trade negotiations. It remains even unclear as to whether the harmonization of the IPR system spurs international trade. The present study argues that institutional harmonization in terms of knowledge production plays an important role in trade of patent-sensitive goods, considering the fact that trade in patent-sensitive goods is heavily concentrated in trade between developed countries. This study empirically examines the relationship between harmonization of patent rights systems and international trade flow based on world bilateral trade data during 1995-2010. Differently to methods of previous studies on this topic, this study uses a structural gravity model based on a translog demand system that is more flexible than constant elasticity of substitution type preferences. The results reveal that institutional distance in terms of patent law has an inverted U-shaped relationship with bilateral trade share in patent-sensitive industries, suggesting similarity in patent systems of exporters and importers raises bilateral trade. This result is robust to the model with additional variables that affect trade costs.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Value creation and value capture from patents: Theory and implications for patent strategies,Patent deployment strategies; Appropriability strategy; Biform model; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; MARKET; APPROPRIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; IDEAS; FIRM; DETERMINANTS; COMPETITION,"This study uses biform game models to examine firms' patent deployment strategies that involve a choice between appropriating a patented technology to gain a unique competitive advantage or licensing the technology to a competitor in the product market. It addresses the question of under what circumstances firms use a patent appropriation strategy over a licensing strategy, or vice versa. By incorporating competitive and cooperative settings, this study develops theory and propositions to illustrate the mechanisms by which patent deployment strategies are chosen by an innovator or follower in a product market as a function of the characteristics of innovation, transaction costs, bargaining power, strategic interactions, and other market conditions. This study contributes to the literature by distinguishing between patent appropriability and value appropriation in a transactional network under rivalry. The model and its extensions provide new insights into appropriation strategies for patent portfolios, which are important intellectual assets in a knowledge-based economy.(c) 2023 The Authors.

We find that a loss of social credit can result in a significant decline in patent quality. The result remains robust to a series of sensitivity checks, including using the alternative measures of key variables and exploiting the number of missionary universities established since the Opium War as an instru-ment for social credit. The possible mechanisms for the effect of social credit on patent quality are further verified, including attenuating external financing constraints and enhancing the innova-tion incentive.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Patent Clearinghouse and Technology Diffusion: What is the Contribution of Arbitration Agreements?,biotechnology industry; vertical contract; arbitration agreements; patent clearinghouse; L14; Q16; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION; INCENTIVES; ACCESS,"One of the acknowledged advantages of patent clearinghouses is that they favor the diffusion of technology. In traditional clearinghouses, patents are usually bundled in pools and sold at a pre-set price. Recently, in the biotechnology industry a new form of clearinghouse has been observed, where patent tariffs are instead bargained over by the clearinghouse members. Exchange is then guaranteed by arbitration agreements to which the negotiating parties are bound, should their bargaining reach a dead end. This paper assesses the effect on technology diffusion of this new type of clearinghouse. We show that such arbitration agreements, through their effect on the outside options, may reduce the incentives of a member of the clearinghouse to license to non-members. This result highlights the role of such arbitration agreements in the diffusion of technology outside the clearinghouse.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Intelligent pharmaceutical patent search on a near-term gate-based quantum computer,; ,"Pharmaceutical patent analysis is the key to product protection for pharmaceutical companies. In patent claims, a Markush structure is a standard chemical structure drawing with variable substituents. Overlaps between apparently dissimilar Markush structures are nearly unrecognizable when the structures span a broad chemical space. We propose a quantum search-based method which performs an exact comparison between two non-enumerated Markush structures with a constraint satisfaction oracle. The quantum circuit is verified with a quantum simulator and the real effect of noise is estimated using a five-qubit superconductivity-based IBM quantum computer. The possibilities of measuring the correct states can be increased by improving the connectivity of the most computation intensive qubits. Depolarizing error is the most influential error. The quantum method to exactly compares two patents is hard to simulate classically and thus creates a quantum advantage in patent analysis.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
Flipping the paradigm of weak patent rights: from theories to evidence,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ASSERTION ENTITIES; ROYALTY STACKING; INNOVATION; MARKET; WORLD; TECHNOLOGY; ADVANTAGE; STANDARDS; QUALITY,"In recent years, we have been confronted with complex challenges requiring coordinated global responses, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change. At the same time, a negative sentiment towards IP rights (IPRs)-and patents in particular-has gained momentum. Sceptics claim that patents hinder the technology adoption needed to tackle these global crises, and proposals to weaken patent rights have intensified. A closer examination of these efforts reveals that they are generally expressed in two ways: on one side, anti-patent advocacy is backed up by popular, although empirically shaky, theories aimed at questioning patents' effectiveness; on the other, the paradigm of weak patents is put forward through more incremental and-only at first glance-subtle policy changes that can potentially undermine the foundations of a balanced patent system. We address and review both efforts. Firstly, we examine the 'first-mover advantage' theory and we find it inadequate as a substitute for patent protection. Secondly, we focus on the cellular connectivity sector where efforts to weaken the patent system are intense. We discuss three common policy proposals: (i) royalty-free licensing for standard essential patents (SEPs), (ii) limiting injunctive relief under the proportionality principle and (iii) narrowing patent transfers and technology markets. We demonstrate that these seemingly minor changes can destabilize the patent system, and we explore the importance of a balanced licensing framework for the emergent Internet of Things (IoT). Ultimately, we highlight how a strong, efficient and balanced patent system remains crucial for fostering research and development (R&D), incentivizing innovators and effectively addressing the global challenges of our current times.",2024,Government & Law,0
Vietnam's Regulation on Intellectual Property Rights Protection: The Context of Digital Transformation,Digital transformation; Copyright; Patents; Intellectual property rights; ,"Vietnam is home to a prospering technology community and numerous enterprises that range from small start-ups to development giants. Virtually all public services are offered online. In fact, the country even has a system for e-residency and data embassies. This achievement derives in part from the nation's transparent and enduring political preferences, but more importantly from Vietnamese law and its regulatory system regarding information, the digital general public, and intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. In this examination of the most pertinent aspects of Vietnam's digital economy legislation, this study explores the nation's regulatory structure regarding copyright and patents within the context of digital transformation. The study discusses the relationship between foreign and national regulations in terms of IPR protection and the advancement of digitalization. Research on Vietnamese regulations and the practical application of major patent and copyright regulations has revealed that in many respects, the nation is highly reliant on the effective operation of a broader foreign institutional and legal framework.

Experimentation and appropriability in early-stage ventures: Evidence from the US software industry,appropriability; entrepreneurship; experimentation; learning; software; TRADE SECRETS; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; ENTREPRENEURIAL; PATENTS; TECHNOLOGIES; STRATEGIES; BUSINESS; IMPACT; ENTRY,"Research SummaryThis study examines the tension between learning and appropriability that arises as early-stage ventures experiment in the market. When formal intellectual property protection is weak, the learning benefits of experimentation may be offset by the imitation risks. I test this argument on a hand-collected dataset of 1,203 US-based software ventures, using the software release life cycle terminology to measure experimentation and the 2014 US Supreme Court decision Alice Corp v CLS Bank International as a negative shock to patent protection. Following this ruling, treated ventures are less likely to engage in experimentation. This pattern is stronger for ventures facing low uncertainty or strong competition. Overall, the evidence suggests that ventures perceive the tension between learning and appropriability and adjust their strategy accordingly.Managerial SummaryThe Lean Startup suggests that entrepreneurs should rely on experimentation in bringing their products to the market. However, the return to experimentation also depends on its costs. One potential cost is the risk of imitation. I study whether ventures perceive the trade-off between learning about the market and the risk of imitation. I hand-collect data on over 1,200 US-based software ventures. I analyze the effect of the US Supreme Court decision Alice Corp v CLS Bank International, which weakened patent protection for firms building financial software. I find that, once patent protection becomes more difficult, ventures conduct less experimentation in the market. Therefore, ventures appear to perceive this trade-off and take it into account in designing their strategy.",2023,Business & Economics,0

We find that stronger intellectual property (IP) protection has a sharper impact on the demand for managerial skill for technologically advanced firms. Firms that were a-priori above the industry median (in terms of technology adoption, more so for R&D expenditure) witness a rise in the share of managerial compensation by 1.3%-8.3% higher than the rest. This effect is completely driven by firms between 5-8th decile with no effect on firms below the median or at the very top of the technological ladder. This observed snail-shape in the firms' response to the IP shock is rationalized in a model where firms within an industry compete for patents by investing in managerial inputs. The observed increase in wage inequality can partly be attributed to a stronger performance pay for high-tech firms. Associatedly, high-tech firms invested more in technology adoption, started to produce more product varieties at higher quality, and filed for more product patent claims.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Co-Opetition Strategy for Remanufacturing the Closed-Loop Supply Chain Considering the Design for Remanufacturing,remanufacturing; closed-loop supply chain; design for remanufacturing; co-opetition; COMPETITION; QUALITY; PRODUCT,"The co-opetition strategy between manufacturers and remanufacturers is a key problem of the closed-loop supply chain, especially for the manufacturers often facing decision-making dilemmas when undertaking the environmental responsibilities of the design for remanufacturing (DfRem). Since DfRem is thought to be advantageous for recycling and remanufacturing, it will lower the production costs for remanufacturers but raise them for manufacturers. On the other hand, manufacturers cannot abandon the DfRem because of environmental responsibilities. This work thus formulates three two-period game models of the competition model with patent protection, the competition model without patent protection, and the cooperation model, which consists of a manufacturer and a remanufacturer, to investigate the decision of the manufacturer and remanufacturer co-opetition strategies. The price, the level of DfRem, the recovery rate, the profit, and other factors are compared across the three models using reverse induction and numerical simulation. In addition, we analyzed the influence of different equilibrium solutions on customer willingness to pay for remanufactured products. We find that cooperation not only contributes to the improvement of DfRem but is also the best choice to ensure the stable development of the supply chain system. Manufacturers, in particular, prefer to work together wherever feasible and actively pursue collaboration rather than advocating for patent protection to fend against remanufacturers, even when they have patent rights.",2022,Social Sciences - Other Topics,0
"Geographic isolation, trade secrecy, and innovation",Innovation; Patents; Geographic isolation; Travel time; Trade secrecy; FACE-TO-FACE; HYBRID CORN; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; LOCAL SEARCH; TECHNOLOGY; FIRM; AGREEMENTS; ECONOMICS; MOBILITY; DETERMINANTS,"This paper studies the impact of geographic isolation on innovation. Geographically isolated regions have lower access to distant knowledge and, thus, may be less effective in producing innovation. In addition, this effect may be moderated by frictions in the labor market, such as trade secrecy protection, that hinder access to local knowledge. To explore this argument, we build a comprehensive dataset of US CBSAs for the period 1971-2014, combining data on travel time, trade secrecy protection, and patenting activity. We find that geographic isolation has a substantial negative impact on innovation quantity and quality. This relationship is at least partially explained by lower access to existing knowledge, as geographic isolation hinders collaboration and, to some extent, mobility. The negative effect is especially pronounced in regions characterized by strong trade secrecy protection. Overall, the evidence suggests that the combination of geographic isolation and trade secrecy protection is detrimental to the innovation performance of regions.",2023,Business & Economics,0
"Pharmaceutical Patents, Innovation, and the Right to Health",Right to Health; Pharmaceutical Patents; Covid-19; Pandemic; TRIPS; ,"There have been rapid strides in developing laws related to pharmaceutical patents in recent years at the global level. The scope of patentability of pharmaceutical patents has increased and has been codified under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The adoption of the TRIPS Agreement resulted in significant changes to the laws related to patents for developing countries, which are the ers of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The developed nations have contended that patents in the medical field are essential for the promotion of research and innovation. They believe that only a strict patent protection regime catalyzes the development of better medicines and techniques. However, this often results in excessive patenting and monopoly over certain drugs. This drives the prices of the drugs up and makes them inaccessible to a large section of the population, particularly in developing and least-developed countries (LDC's). The scenario regarding vaccine-related patents during the Covid-19 Pandemic was grim since profits were prioritized over people's Health. The pharmaceutical companies were inclined to secure profits and protect their research from being used elsewhere. This amplifies the debate between the protection of Intellectual Property Rights and the Right to the Health of people. The developed countries have contended that the exceptions provided under TRIPS are sufficient to safeguard the health rights of the general populace in developing and LDC's. However, the experiences of the developing countries with the implementation of the exceptions to the TRIPS have yet to be fruitful, with developed countries repeatedly pressuring them into protecting patents at the expense of the Health of their citizens. Geopolitical tensions could further aggravate this. This is evidenced by the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West, which stares at a situation in which Western Pharmaceutical Companies can deny it access to medicines. The unavailability of modern medicine can adversely impact the Human Rights of its citizens in such a scenario. The tensions between different nations can flare over anytime, and the rigid application of TRIPS can be catastrophic to the health rights of the citizens. The article analyses the exceptions under TRIPS and their Effectiveness in protecting the Right to Health. It also suggests modification in the existing Intellectual Property Regime related to pharmaceutical patents to ensure that the Right to Health is not compromised.",2023,Government & Law,0

Scholars have investigated factors that facilitate or hinder the use of such IP protection strategies by identifying related country, sector, and firm characteristics. However, the extant literature has overlooked the role of the characteristics of a firm's founding team on the choice of an IPPM strategy. Using data from a large cross-sectional sample of European small, young, and innovative firms, we show that controlling for firm size, R&D intensity, and other firm and market effects, founding team characteristics, such as gender and education, greatly influence the choice of a strategy. In particular, in line with the general finding that women patent less, we find that firms with more women in the founding team patent less than firms with more male founders; but contrary to the literature that has primarily focused on large firms, we find that as the number of female founders increases, small, young entrepreneurial firms tend to use less informal IPPMs rather than formal IPPMs. We also find, within the context of entrepreneurship policy, that the education and not experience of founding team members is a main predictor of IP adoption.",2021,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,0
Redesigning Copyright Protection in the Era of Artificial Intelligence,; RIGHTS,"How to protect the creations of artificial intelligence (AI) systems through copyright law is one of the most significant and complex legal issues of our time. Debated by stakeholders around the world, the issue has so far evaded consensus. However, a series of administrative and judicial rulings has altered the landscape. In 2019, a Chinese district court affirmed the copyrightability of a news article written by an AI-powered robot, clarifying that it was the AI developer that should be deemed copyright owner of the news article. In 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, and the United Kingdom High Court prominently denied patent applications designating an AI system as an inventor. This Article reveals the profound implications of these recent AI rulings for copyright protection of AI-generated works. It examines how these rulings shed new light on the nature and scope of authorship and ownership, two legal issues that are central to deciding whether and how AI-generated works merit copyright protection. Drawing on its in-depth study of the recent AI rulings, the Article proposes a broad-based, forward-looking approach to protecting AI-generated works through a two-tiered legal mechanism. It suggests that legislators may consider awarding sui generis rights to AI works generated with human contributions, while those generated autonomously by AI systems without such contributions should be placed in the public domain without copyright protection.",2022,Government & Law,0
The big push to a knowledge-based economy with intellectual property rights protection,big push; intellectual property rights; technological change; PATENT PROTECTION; INDUSTRIALIZATION,"This study examines the reasons some developing countries would not enforce intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. In a country with low IPR protection, firms have much incentives to imitate better technology. Therefore, the enforcement of IPR protection is necessary to prohibit imitation. However, given a state in which many agents are imitating technologies, it is difficult to enforce IPR protection because these agents have no incentives to protect IPR. Considering such a situation, we investigate the interaction between IPR institutions and technology choice. Furthermore, we discuss policy issues to achieve IPR protection.",2020,Development Studies; Business & Economics,0
Protection of intellectual property and human rights during health emergencies: an assessment of the patent waiver proposal,COVID-19; Vaccine; Patent waiver; TRIPS; Compulsory licensing; Intellectual property rights; EXTERNALITIES; JUSTIFICATION,"Purpose- Several countries, such as South Africa and India, believe that intellectual property rights (IPRs), including patents, impede the efficient increase in vaccine production to inoculate the global population as they scramble to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Their proposal at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to waive these pharmaceutical patents has been met with resistance from a few developed countries, who believe that the abrogation of IPRs is unnecessary, even during a pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the impact of a potential waiver of medical patents at the WTO versus the status quo of IPR laws in the global economy.Design/methodology/approach- This study examines key arguments from economic and moral standpoints regarding the provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and other related international agreements and their validity based on the premise of the internalisation of positive externalities posed by vaccines.Findings -The effectiveness of the TRIPS agreement in securing medical access is weak on account of the ability of profit-making multinationals to secure IP rights and on account of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral agreement that supports patent evergreening and a period of protection on test data which challenges the access to medicines and the fundamental human right to health.Originality/value-This study examines international IPRs through the lens of human rights and proposes a new system that balances the two.",2024,Health Care Sciences & Services,0

Design/methodology/approach This paper analyzes the decisions of the original manufacturer, the retailer and the third-party remanufacturer of two periods, using Stackelberg game and obtains the equilibrium solutions of the three parties. Findings The study finds that consumers' focus degree to the remanufacturing degree has a negative correlation with the equilibrium unit patent-licensing fee, the retail price of remanufactured products, the remanufacturing degree of remanufactured products and the wholesale price of new products in the first period, but has a positive correlation with the retail price of new products in the second period. Originality/value (1) Consumers' focus degree to the remanufacturing degree has a negative correlation with the equilibrium unit patent-licensing fee, the retail price of remanufactured products, the remanufacturing degree of remanufactured products and the wholesale price of new products in the first period, but has a positive correlation with the retail price of new products in the second period.

"Intellectual property protection, infringement disputes, and, corporate innovation investment persistence",infringement disputes; innovation investment persistence; intellectual property protection; PATENT PROTECTION; RIGHTS,"To examine the important role of regional intellectual property (IP) protection, we empirically check the impact of infringement disputes on corporate innovation investment persistence. We document that IP protection enforcement can significantly and negatively mitigate the infringer's innovation investment persistence but positively enhance that of the infringed firm. This effect is more pronounced for non-high-tech or non-state-owned firms. Moreover, IP protection mainly reshapes a firm's perceptions of innovation investment persistence through the efficiency and fairness of law enforcement. Our findings provide insights into optimizing the IP protection environment, especially for emerging economies.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Stringency of environmental regulation and eco-innovation: Evidence from the eleventh Five-Year Plan and green patents,Environmental regulation; Eco-innovation; Green patents; Difference-in-differences; TECHNOLOGY; INCENTIVES,"Using the variation in pollution reduction targets across provinces and time variations (before and after the eleventh Five-Year Plan), we examine the impact of stricter environmental regulation upon the production of green patents by firms in China. We find that Chinese manufacturing firms, located in provinces with stricter pollution targets, produced a higher volume and intensity of green patents. Our results suggest that stricter environmental regulatory frameworks in emerging economies are not only combating pollution, but also shifting the innovation activities of manufacturing firms towards building a stock of knowledge in environmental protection. This process, undoubtedly, has the potential to generate disruptive eco-innovations. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Patented product remanufacturing and technology licensing in a closed-loop supply chain,Supply chain management; Remanufacturing; Patented product; Technology licensing; COMPETITION; DECISIONS,"In practice, the OEM may license technology to a remanufacturer to help the remanufacturer carry out rema-nufacturing activities while charging patent licensing fees. This kind of cooperative behavior has a significant impact on the environmental and economic benefits brought by remanufacturing activities. However, the patent licensing behavior will also improve the quality of remanufactured product produced by remanufacturer, and increase their competition with OEM's products. So, how do consumers' quality preferences for products affect OEMs' patent licensing decisions? What kind of patent license contract can bring more profits to the OEM? Which patent license contract is more beneficial to environmental protection? To answer these questions, this paper examines the best production strategies and the best technology cooperation mode of the supply chain member companies, with considering the influence of consumers' quality preferences. Via the Cournot duopoly model, three common licensing strategies are investigated and compared, and the following conclusions are drawn. (i) When the OEM does not license the patent, if the quality of the remanufactured product is relatively low compared with that of the new product, the remanufacturer will not enter the market to carry out rema-nufacturing activities. (ii) The OEM will benefit from the quality-improved remanufacturing patent license, and will be willing to license the patented technology to the remanufacturer only if the unit cost gap between the new and remanufactured products is not very large. The higher the quality of the remanufactured product prior to patent licensing, the lower the patent licensing fee that the OEM can charge, and the lower the profit that the OEM can obtain through the patent licensing. (iii) Two-part tariff licensing is always the best patent licensing strategy for the OEM, regardless of the quality level of the remanufactured product prior to patent licensing. This study elucidates the optimal patent licensing strategy options for the OEM and provides some theoretical con-tributions and practical implications.",2022,Computer Science; Engineering,0
Strategic use of patent opposition safeguard to improve equitable access to innovative health technologies: A case study of CAR T-cell therapy Kymriah,Civil society; gene therapy; Kymriah; patent opposition; public health; ,"Kymriah is an innovative cancer therapy which works by removing disease fighting T-cells from patients, genetically modifying or reprogramming the immune cells to attack cancer, and re-infusing them back into the patients. It treats childhood blood and bone marrow cancer. The cost of this new hope-giving gene therapy is CHF 450,000 per treatment. This exorbitantly high price set by Novartis, in exercise of its exclusive rights resulting from patent protection, undermines the real-world impact of this revolutionary therapy. On December 16, 2019, Novartis relinquished its European patent on Kymriah as a result of a successful patent opposition lodged by 'Public Eye' and 'Medicins du Monde'. This case study of Kymriah highlights the potential role of civil society in improving equitable and affordable access to innovative health technologies by using the procedural safeguard of patent opposition.

Interpretational Dilemma on Divisional Patent Applications in India,patent application; divisional patent application; division of patent application; Indian patent law; ,"A patent grants a limited monopoly to the patent applicant in lieu of disclosing his invention to the public. The scope of protection available to a patent applicant is decided entirely based on the claims of the patent, and hence, what is being claimed forms a critical aspect of the strategy. Further, a patent application may disclose different embodiments of the same invention and/or distinct inventions having different inventive concepts. Ideally, claims could be included for both the different embodiments and the distinct inventions. However, sometimes, due to business considerations or huge costs incurred by including additional claims, patent applicants may claim only some of the different embodiments and/or distinct inventions. During the examination stage, the Controller of Patents may raise an objection in the event he opines that the claims of the patent application relate to multiple distinct inventions, with the remedy under Section 16(1) being available to divide the patent application (now referred as parent application) into one or more further applications during the pendency of the parent application. However, is there a remedy available to the patent applicant if he desires to voluntarily divide his parent application to cover any embodiment/distinct invention that was not claimed in the parent application? Using the doctrinal method, the paper analyses the language of Section 16(1) by applying rules of interpretation, and while additionally taking into account the legislative intent behind Section 16, ascertains whether the true import of the said section, as it stands today, is actually what has been decided by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) or if the language of Section 16 does provide some leeway to the patent applicants to file voluntary divisional applications for any matter that has been merely disclosed in the parent application and not claimed.",2022,Government & Law,0
Analysis of Patented Homeopathic Products and Medicines in Brazil,Homeopathy; Homeopathic medicines; Pharmacy; Property Intellectual; Patents; ,"Objectives: This study was to carry out a prospective study on the patents reports of homeopathic formulations in the brazilian intellectual property bank, the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI). Methods: This is a prospective research of patents referring to homeopathy products and medicines carried in May 2020. Searches were made for patents deposited with homeopathic purpose with the terms homeopathy and homeopathic from the first document until the last one deposited in 2019. We have found thirty-eight deposits with the search terms cited above, after exclusion of duplicates we selected twenty four. Results: Among the 24 patent reports selected, 15 (62.5%) were patents of invention. Among the classification of products, we highlight those of type A61K with 19 (79.1%). Twenty-four deposits were selected with the search terms homeopathy and homeopathic. 20 (83.3 %) deposits with the term homeopathic and 4 (16.66%) to the term homeopathy. Among the reports stand out patents of homeopathic formulations 14 (58.3%). There were a greater number of deposits in the years 2009 and 2013, both with 4 (16.6%) deposits. Conclusion: After analyzing patents on homeopathic products at the intellectual property bank in Brazil, it is concluded that most are related to new formulations.

Artificial intelligence and patents in Brazil: Overview on patentability and comparative study on patent filings,Artificial intelligence; Industrial property indicators; Patents; Intellectual property; ,"Innovations related to artificial intelligence (AI) can impact many technological fields and gather attention of several sectors from industry. Brazil is a developing country with a large territory and consumer market, attracting investment from foreign companies, including AI technologies. In the present work, we carry out a review of the Brazilian IP Law, Guidelines and Resolutions regarding patentability of AI inventions in Brazil, and also perform comparative analyses with the guidelines from the EPO and USPTO. Then, patent searches are carried out to analyze filing indicators of patent applications for AI inventions, wherein it is possible to verify that most of the filing applicants in Brazil are foreign companies, mainly from the US. Brazilian entities, which rank second overall in filing for patent applications in Brazil, do not even appear among the main applicants for AI inventions. We conclude that Brazil is not a competitive country in the production of patents related to AI, and it is important for Brazil to establish some degree of legal certainty regarding patent protection for AI inventions and disseminate knowledge about protecting such inventions by patents, so that inventors opt to disclose their AI inventions instead of keeping them as a trade secret. Therefore, more and more sectors of society might benefit from innovations arising from AI.",2023,Information Science & Library Science,0
"A Patent Bibliometric Analysis of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) Technology",carbon neutrality; carbon capture; carbon utilization; carbon storage; CCUS; patent bibliometric analysis; CYCLIC CARBONATES; CO2 CAPTURE; EVOLUTION,"Large amounts of CO2 from human socioeconomic activities threaten environmental sustainability. Moreover, uncontrolled resource use and lack of relevant technology exacerbate this issue. For this reason, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology has gained worldwide attention. Many scholars have researched CCUS, but few have used CCUS patent bibliometric analysis from a unified perspective. This article aims to provide a conclusive analysis for CCUS researchers and policymakers, as well as summarize the innovation trends, technological distribution, and topic evolution. Based on 11,915 pieces of patent data from the Derwent Innovations Index, we used bibliometric analysis and data mining methods to conduct research on four dimensions: overall trend, geographical distribution, patentees, and patent content. The results of this article are as follows. CCUS has entered a rapid development stage since 2013. Patents are mainly distributed geographically in China, the US, and Japan, especially in heavy industries such as energy and electricity. Large enterprises hold patents with a relatively stable network of cooperators and attach great importance to international patent protection.

The Impact of Drug Approval-Patent Linkage System on Patent Applications: Evidence from the KORUS FTA,Intellectual Property Rights; KORUS-FTA; Drug approval-patent linkage system; TRIPS; Pharmaceuticals; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY,"Purpose - This paper empirically investigates the impact of strengthened intellectual property rights (IPRs) within the KORUS Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on patent applications filed by domestic pharmaceutical companies in Korea. Design/methodology - In this study, the distribution of the dependent variable is assumed to follow a Poisson or a negative binomial distribution, given the count nature of the dependent variable. Therefore, it can be estimated through the Panel Count Model. The study utilizes Poisson panel analysis and negative binomial panel analysis. Findings - The results of the negative binomial panel analysis and the Poisson panel analysis affirm that the conclusion of the KORUS-FTA had a significantly positive effect on the number of patent applications by domestic pharmaceutical companies. These findings suggest that domestic pharmaceutical companies actively sought patents following the signing of the KORUS-FTA, driven by the drug approval-patent linkage system designed to fortify intellectual property rights for drugs. Originality/value - Limited empirical research has been conducted on the drug approval-patent linkage system in the KORUS- FTA. This study empirically confirmed the impact of institutional changes in the pharmaceutical industry on patent applications at the corporate level within the KORUS-FTA context. Such insights are crucial for formulating strategies for pharmaceutical companies and indicating policy directions for the pharmaceutical industry in the future.",2023,Business & Economics,0
THE UNITED STATES' CLIMATE PATENTING BEHAVIOR AFTER THE PARIS AGREEMENT WITHDRAWAL ANNOUNCEMENT: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS AND A FAST-TRACK PROPOSAL,; ,"When the United States announced that it would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, some commentators speculated whether this announcement would affect patent applications on climate technologies. This Note studies the effect of that withdrawal on patenting behavior in the U.S. by conducting a difference-in-difference analysis on U.S. patent applications on climate technologies compared to patent applications on climate technologies filed in other countries, patent applications filed on all technologies in the U.S., and patent applications filed on mechanical engineering technologies in the U.S. This Note finds that U.S. patent applications on climate technologies declined relative to these other groups. Yet, this Note does not find that the announced withdrawal from the Paris Agreement caused the decline relative to other countries, nor the decline relative to all technologies in the U.S. It does find that the decline relative to mechanical engineering technologies is statistically significant, which suggests that the announced withdrawal from the Paris agreement caused this decline. Even if the announced withdrawal from the Paris Agreement did not cause these declines, they do have effects on intellectual property protection in climate technologies. Accordingly, this Note proposes a program by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to address these relative declines and provides model rules for this program.",2021,Government & Law,0
Enhancing Access to Medicines: Interpreting Exceptions to Patent Rights in Article 30 TRIPS,; INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC-LAW; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; GLOBAL GOVERNANCE; DOHA DECLARATION; FREE-TRADE; WTO; WORLD; AGREEMENT; DISPUTES,"Ensuring access to essential medicines is a significant challenge for states. Concerns around strict patent protection becoming a barrier to access presents a potential tension between states' international obligations set out in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and states' human rights obligations in relation to health. Such concerns exist not only with regard to TRIPS, but also other bilateral and regional free trade agreements. This article examines how such tensions could be addressed through treaty interpretation, in particular the extent to which TRIPS could be interpreted to serve public health objectives. Specific focus is placed on the exceptions to patent protection in Article 30 of TRIPS to evaluate whether the WTO Dispute Settlement Body could apply a broader interpretation of Article 30, in light of the objectives and purpose of TRIPS outlined in Articles 7 and 8, for the purpose of enhancing access to cheaper generic medicines.",2022,Business & Economics; Government & Law,0
Are Litigated Patents More Valuable?

In rapidly growing technological systems, incumbent firms use a range of intellectual property rights (IPR)-related strategies to gain competitive advantage. This is often accompanied by an increased number of patent lawsuits, which signals a strong IPR regime and can be detrimental to innovation as previously shown for various sectors. In this article we examine the nature of LED-related litigated and non-litigated patents and explore the main drivers of patent lawsuits. From our analysis we obtain four results. First, litigated LED patents are of significantly higher quality compared to non-litigated ones. Second, even though the quality of defended patents is high, two leading plaintiffs are non-practicing entities. Third, litigations generally occur between incumbent firms. Fourth, the 2005US Energy Policy Actseems to have reshaped the dynamics of innovation in the sector. We discuss the implications of these results with respect to the literature on the effect of litigations on innovation in general, and on eco-innovations in particular.",2020,Business & Economics,0
The status of patenting plants in the Global South,developing countries; Global South; patents; plants; seed; PATENTABILITY; TECHNOLOGY; PROTECTION; GENE,"Over the last few decades, the number of patents on plants and plant parts has greatly increased in various parts of the world. Most research, however, has focused exclusively on developed countries-the United States and European Union states in particular-while little is known about the extent to which plants are being patented in other parts of the world. This article aims to fill this information gap by providing an overview of the status of patenting plants in the developing countries and emerging economies of the Global South. The research is based on the analysis of legal provisions, patentability guidelines, court decisions (where they exist) and a sample of patents granted in the countries selected for this study. The findings indicate that despite the flexibilities of the World Trade Organization Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement regarding the nonpatentability of plants, 60% of the 126 countries in the Global South for which data were available to allow for the patenting of plants or parts thereof, and many such patents have been identified.

The results reveal that administrative and procedural costs are significant for firm-level patenting activity. However, not all administrative and procedural costs have equal effects. Higher administrative costs often encourage patent application and validation by solving the adverse selection problem and short-run opportunism, as well as other sources of asymmetric information. The effective administration of intellectual property law and low-cost enforcement are found to considerably foster patenting activity. The effects are robust for various mis-specification checks and do not disappear once country-level research and development infrastructure proxies are controlled for. The extreme bounds of administrative and procedural costs are computed across more than 5 billion regressions, and the sizeable impact of administration on patent application and validation outcomes is confirmed.(c) 2021 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

Using two countries, a developed North and a developing South, the model examines Northern firms employing researchers in the South in order to produce new varieties of a good. The Northern firms risk their product being imitated when offshoring research. Southern researchers may take information learned while employed by the Northern firm and start their own competing firm. The model's main predictions are supported empirically by a data set constructed with U.S. patent data. For high-tech industries, stronger IPR protection in the South increases both industry-level and firm-level offshoring at a rate faster than low-tech industries. Southern import tariffs do not affect firm-level innovative R&D offshoring.",2021,Business & Economics; International Relations,0
The impact of patentees assessment based on the heterogeneous patent innovation network,Patentee impact; Heterogeneous patent innovation network; CWAPN; Chinese green patents; Energy field; INDEX,"As a vital factor in technological innovation, patentee plays a significant role in the process of scientific and technological innovation, researching patentee has attracted the attention of experts and scholars. Previously, scholars have mainly quantified patent indicators or constructed homogeneous information networks to analyze patentees, but these methods cannot objectively measure the impact of patentees. Therefore, this study proposes a novel approach to assessing patentee impact based on a heterogeneous information network. The proposed method distinguishes the weight of different types of nodes using a weighted mechanism and extracts three types of fine-grained characteristics of network nodes. This approach results in the construction of a heterogeneous patent innovation network and the development of a new patentee impact assessment algorithm called CWAPN. Using Chinese green patents in the field of energy conservation and environmental protection as an example, experimental results show that the CWAPN algorithm can effectively assess the impact of patentees. Thereby identifying patentees who have made outstanding contributions to sustainable development in China.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
Innovation diffusion enabler or barrier: An investigation of international patenting based on temporal exponential random graph models,International patenting network (IPN); Market covering; Competitive threat; Temporal exponential random graph model; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; FOREIGN FIRMS; TRADE; TECHNOLOGY; PROTECTION; CHINA; GLOBALIZATION; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE,"The past two decades have witnessed a rapid growth of foreign patenting, accounting for an average of 15.4% of all patents filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) in the critical technology domains. This study explores two hypotheses in explaining this worldwide phenomenon in the networked relationships, that is, market covering and competitive threat. International patenting networks (IPN) over the period 1999 to 2018 are established using the dataset of cross-border ownership patents from 89 countries released from OECD's Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry. The temporal exponential random graph models (TERGMs) are formulated to test the two hypotheses, proxied by import network and competitive import network, conditioning on country-specific, network self-organizing, and exogenous network characteristics. Results of this study lend support to market covering hypothesis, that is, higher exports lead to greater propensity to patent abroad. This finding identifies international patenting as an enabler of innovation diffusion rather than a barrier. Furthermore, results of controlling variables indicate technological distance exerts an inhibiting effect, whereas charges for intellectual property rights has a promoting influence on IPN evolution, thus shedding light on the catching up of developed economies.",2021,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0
Analysis on patents of health care products with substances of medicine food homology in China,patent analysis; patent pattern; substances of medicine food homology; traditional Chinese medicine; ,"Objective: The concept of substances of medicine food homology (SMFH) has garnered significant attention in recent years. This study conducts a systematic analysis of patent literature related to SMFH, and elucidates the development trends, technical hotspots, and the overall patent protection landscape of SMFH in China over the past two decades. Methods: The patent search focused on the SMFH varieties as the objects of inquiry, with retrieval conducted in patent databases. Subsequently, the acquired data underwent processing, analysis, and visualization. Results: While the technical threshold for pharmaceutical applications surpasses that of the food service sector, the former may assume a prominent role in the future. Research and development (R&D) activities in the southeast of China demonstrate robust activity than other regions. Colleges and scientific research institutions exhibit substantial advantages in patent applications compared with individuals and hold greater potential for future development. Conclusion: The findings of this patent analysis indicate that China's SMFH industry are presently undergoing a transition from an extensive model to a high-quality model. The quality and technical standards of SMFH products are consistently improving. Consequently, there is a need for more stringent patent application requirements to align with the evolving development needs. (c) 2024 Tianjin Press of Chinese Herbal Medicines.

"Patenting Personalized Medicine Molecules, Information, and the Body",; PROTECTION; LAW,"The histories of patent law and medical practice in the United States have intersected in various ways over the past 150 years, beginning with the professional campaign against patent medicines in the late nineteenth century, and culminating, for now, in attempts to patent the diagnostic procedures discussed in this article. The patenting of diagnostic procedures provokes a set of fundamental questions about the episteme of patent law. These questions are not new. They emerged at the very origins of patent jurisprudence, centered on the question of what distinguished an invention from a law of nature, and this question of patentability has persistently reemerged over the past century in the contexts of plant breeding, biotechnology, and now diagnostic medicine. So far, the question has been addressed in terms that imagine the invention as a machine, understood in the figurative sense of a transformative organization of forces and elements. But diagnostic procedures, because they address the body informationally, as a system based on the recursive patterning of signals rather than a linear transformation of inputs into outputs, stretch the figure of the machine to the point at which it ceases to be effective. How then should one define and delimit invention?",2021,History & Philosophy of Science,0
Patent management and the globalization of firms: the case of Siemens (1890-1945),Knowledge transfer; Globalization; Patent management; General electric; Siemens; Patent management; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; PROTECTION; TECHNOLOGY; ASSETS,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss how multinational enterprises have historically managed global patenting and to what extent the localization of patent management has supported the expansion of these enterprises. This study focuses on the electric appliance industry (one of the first industries to see the emergence of global companies) and consider the case of Siemens, a German multinational company, comparing it to General Electric (GE), an American company. Design/methodology/approach The work adopts a global business history approach. Taking GE's global patent-management model, described by Nishimura (2004, 2009, 2016), as the benchmark, this study analyzed Siemens' worldwide control of its intellectual property rights between 1890 and Second World War, using German, Japanese and American primary sources. Findings Patent management is a common means for firms to globalize and transfer technology internationally, but it can take various forms. While GE transferred patent management to its foreign subsidiaries (a process known as localization), Siemens kept worldwide patent management at its headquarters - except in Japan, where in time it transferred this activity to a joint venture. The transfer of production called for localization of patent management while focusing on exporting to other markets made it possible to keep patent management at headquarters. Originality/value Patents are usually a source for quantitative surveys. This paper uses them to discuss how multinational companies manage property rights globally. It is the first paper to address this issue by comparing two major actors in a similar industry.",2022,Business & Economics,0
University-industry technology transfer: the commercialization of university's patents,University patent; university-industry relations; technology transfer; commercialisation; INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; SCIENTISTS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PORTUGAL; SCIENCE; EUROPE; GROWTH; UK,"The study aims at investigating the main challenges in University-Industry Technology Transfer (UITT) process, as well as the relevant factors for the successful licensing of university inventions. We interviewed academic inventors of several patents in force, owned by Portuguese public universities. We evaluated the process of patent development considering three phases: research, protection and commercialisation. We observed that most of the patents resulted from master/doctoral research and were developed by small, departmental or interdepartmental work teams without industry collaboration. The main motivations were related to curricular valorisation (prestige/visibility/reputation), potential of commercialisation, and/or university incentives. Inflexibility in university procedures and in negotiating with industry; lack of R&D funding to further develop the technology suitable for marketing; and low market potential of the patent were the most cited barriers. The collaboration with industry seems beneficial in the three phases of the UITT process, and its involvement contributed to diminish several of the barriers identified in the UITT process.",2020,Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics,0

We explain how the integration of intellectual property with international trade rules led to the globalization of pharmaceutical patenting, and then how additional provisions related to pharmaceutical products have been introduced by regional and bilateral trade agreements. We describe the additional 'TRIPS-Plus' rules contained in recent trade agreements, which go beyond the requirements of the World Trade Organization's TRIPS Agreement, and explain the potential challenges that they may create for developing countries. We draw attention to the conceptual and methodological challenges of assessing the effects of patent provisions in trade agreements on prices and access to drugs, with particular emphasis on the importance of timing. Depending on when countries began allowing drugs to be patented, TRIPS-Plus provisions have different effects; and when pharmaceutical patenting has been in place for more countries for more time, the effects of TRIPS-Plus provisions will change again.",2020,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,0
"Technology transfer, climate change and the developing countries: the difficulties posed by green patents",; RIGHTS,"center dot This article considers the absence of enforceable technology transfer obligations within the Paris Agreement. It acknowledges that the patent system is an imperfect incentive for innovation but that patent protection is necessary for research and development. center dot Developed countries have consistently objected to attempts by developing countries to address patents in international treaties, most recently the Paris Agreement. As such, this article proposes an incentivized licensing approach that would require governments to grant tax deductions to companies that enter into green technology licensing deals with developing countries. This approach recognizes the role that patents play in technology transfer and places an obligation on governments to actively encourage green technology transfer. Furthermore, governments of developing countries would be able to access the Green Climate Fund to ensure that licensors are adequately remunerated for their technology. center dot This solution strikes a balance between the needs of companies to recoup investment, the desire of developed countries to maintain strong patent rights and the ability of developing countries to access technology transfer to achieve a Just Transition.",2023,Government & Law,0
Bridge strongly or focus-An analysis of bridging patents in four application fields of carbon fiber reinforcements,Patent intelligence; Patentometrics; Claim analysis; Forward citations; Technological scope; Text-mining analysis; VALUE-APPROPRIATION; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY; CONVERGENCE; PERFORMANCE,"The major purpose of patents is to protect technical inventions. As a rule of thumb, an inventor (and the patent attorney) should aim to achieve the broadest possible scope of protection for the invention. Our basic research question is, whether this rule proves helpful under all circumstances. We aim to answer this question by means of an informetric approach, focusing on bridging patents between several application fields of a technology. Prior work has identified patents that build bridges between two or more application fields of a technology. So far, these bridging patents have only marginally been analyzed to obtain an idea of how the bridging intensity is achieved. One purpose of our paper is to fill this gap and characterize patents of this kind by means of an approach based on text mining, claim analysis, and forward citation analysis. We select the case of carbon fiber reinforced plastics as an example, focusing on four application fields for which we develop a basic patent set. We identify in this patent set semantic anchor points, and - subsequently - bridging patents of different intensity. We expand our patent set by accepting a slightly lower precision level, which leads to a considerably higher recall value. We find that bridging patents comprise a greater number as well as a higher complexity of claims than non-bridging patents. Interestingly, the relationship between the intensity of bridging as an independent variable and forward citations as a dependent variable is described by a u-shaped curve. This answers the basic research question in the way that when writing a patent application, inventors should bridge strongly or focus. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Scientific and technological contributions from the 'Periphery': A look at patent applications filed with the participation of Colombians,Patents; Knowledge; Industrial property; Intellectual property; Inventors; INNOVATION,"By their nature, patents allow for the protection of creations or inventions in various technological sectors and in countries of commercial or industrial interest. They also record information about inventors and holders, as well as the novel features of the invention. With this in mind, this article considers the contributions of Colombians in the global context by analyzing patent applications submitted between 2000 and 2019 in jurisdictions other than their own. The research focused on the analysis of patent application records obtained from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) patent database, in which at least one Colombian was listed as a holder. The results show that while the number of applications was not very high, they were distributed across various technological areas and were primarily filed in Europe, North America, and Asia, with minimal participation in Central and South America. Analysis also revealed a high level of collaboration, with 69% of the applications filed jointly. Additionally, 84% of the holders associated with the records obtained are natural persons.",2023,Information Science & Library Science,0
Early Identification of Significant Patents Using Heterogeneous Applicant-Citation Networks Based on the Chinese Green Patent Data,green innovation; Chinese green patents; heterogeneous network; age bias; JOURNAL IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISM; SEARCH; BIAS,"With the deterioration of the environment and the acceleration of resource consumption, green patent innovation focusing on environmental protection fields has become a research hot-spot around the world. Previous researchers constructed homogeneous information networks to analyze the influence of patents based on citation ranking algorithms. However, a patent information network is a complex network containing multiple pieces of information (e.g., citation, applicant, inventor), and the use of a single information network will result in incomplete information or information loss, and the obtained results are biased. In addition, scholars constructed centrality indicators to assess the importance of patents with less consideration of the age bias problem of algorithms and models, and the results obtained are inaccurate. In this paper, based on the Chinese green patent (CNGP) dataset from 1985 to 2020, a CNGP heterogeneous applicant-citation network is constructed, and the rescaling method and normalization procedure are used to solve the age bias. The results illustrate that the method proposed in this paper is able to identify significant patents earlier, and the performance of the rescaled indegree (R_ID) works best such as the IR score is 17.32% in the top 5% of the rankings, and it is the best in the constructed dynamic heterogeneous networks as well. In addition, the constructed heterogeneous information network has better results compared with the traditional homogeneous information network, such as the NIR score of R_ID metrics can be improved by 2% under the same condition. Therefore, the analysis method proposed in this paper can reasonably evaluate the quality of patents and identify significant patents earlier, thus providing a new method for scientists to measure the quality of patents.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Does the Patents Act 1990 Protect Space Technology?,; ,"Australian intellectual property (IP) laws were legislated before any real prospect of the commercialisation of outer space. However, over the past decade, there has been an explosion in the number of commercial entities performing activities in outer space. For example, commercial space stations and in- orbit R&D facilities are currently in the planning and building stage for launch in the very near term. These activities require extensive research and development, and any IP generated needs to be protected as part of commercialisation strategies. However, the current legislation does not provide enough protection for space-related technology due to the limited extent of this legislation into outer space.

Such uncertainty increases the complexity of ownership decisions in target firms. Drawing from signaling theory, we articulate how international acquirers perceive the pre-emptive power of target firms' patent portfolio as a positive signal, increasing their confidence in target firms' technology and leading them to seek a higher level of equity. We further argue that the strength of the target firm's home country's patent system also acts as a positive signal that encourages investors to acquire a higher level of equity in cross-border acquisitions. However, it also weakens then impact of the pre-emptive power signal. Our findings have implications for scholars, policymakers, and managers.",2023,Business & Economics,0

Generic Drugs and the Struggle to Compete: The Role of Skinny Labels,Drugs; Patent protection; Generics; Drug labels; ,"Purpose: The generic drug industry currently faces multiple, serious issues that threaten the US drug supply. So-called skinny labels  are one of the few tools authorized by Congress to expedite entry into the market by generic competitors when the first patent for a brand's drug compound (only) expires. This article reviews the law on this expedited marketing pathway for generic competitors, as well as limitations on its use. Methods: We examined the literature on patent protection of brand drugs, including the timelines for production of generic competitors. We also examined the law concerning skinny labels, including a recent decision of the US Federal Circuit Court that clearly articulates the guidelines concerning entry into the generic market, including labeling, marketing, and promotion. Findings: Skinny labels that follow the regulations set forth in the Hatch -Waxman Act, including the necessary carve -out procedure for methods of use  still protected by 1 or more active patents, do not infringe a brand drug's label. Furthermore, the skinny label does not induce or contribute to infringement merely because its label contains US Food and Drug Administration-required safety profile data -even when the data cross-reference superiority studies on still -patent protected methods of use elsewhere in the label. Implications: Generic drugs have become essential to the broad, general availability of clinical therapeutic agents. The Hatch -Waxman Act was intended to facilitate entry of generic competitors into the marketplace, and the skinny label is an important tool to accomplish that end. As long as the generic manufacturer follows the essential skinny -label rules, specifically including marketing the compound without promoting or advertising those methods of use still protected by ongoing patents, the law will not find induced or contributory infringement.",2024,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
Computer-Implemented Inventions and Computer Programs-Status Quo in Slovenia and EU,computer-implemented inventions; computer programs; patent; copyright; status quo; ,"In Slovenia, there is no legal basis for computer-implemented inventions, and in the European Union (EU) such inventions are not yet clearly defined. Over the last twenty years there have been many heated debates in the EU arena concerning a single legal instrument, but a final solution remains elusive. In Slovenia and the EU, legal protection of computer-implemented inventions thus remains on thin ice: there are certain non-obvious combinations for obtaining a patent, but ultimately the decisive factor may as well be how the patent application is written. This status quo therefore necessitates an examination of this field: to arrive at a legal basis that would regulate the patenting of computer-implemented inventions it is necessary to identify and address the most critical points. This paper deals with this issue. It starts by presenting examples of computer-implemented inventions, followed by an overview of the state of play the status quo concerning legal protection in Slovenia and the EU.

NON-LINEAR EFFECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ON TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: EVIDENCE FROM EMERGING AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,Intellectual property rights; Innovation; Non linear relationship; Economic development; Emerging; Developing countries; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT PROTECTION; INVESTMENT; GROWTH,"The protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is a key determinant of innovation. Following the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), all member states of the World Trade Organization are called upon to introduce high intellectual property rights standards. Hence the importance of the issue relative to IPR. Recent studies suggest that IPR protection stimulates innovation only under certain conditions. In this study, we suppose that IPR have a positive impact on technological innovation only in countries with high levels of economic development. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between intellectual property rights, economic development and technological innovation in the context of emerging and developing countries. To measure innovation, we use patent applications filed by residents of a given country with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. IPR is measured by the Ginarte and Park index.

Technological disruption and patent activities: adoption of robots by Chinese manufacturing firms,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; SUPPLIER INVOLVEMENT; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; DOMESTIC FIRMS; MARKET; SPILLOVERS; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION,"Using a panel of manufacturing firms in China for the period 2006 to 2015, this study investigates how the adoption of industrial robots, as a technological disruption, affects firm patent activities through intra-industry interactions (robot adoption by peer firms in the same industry) and inter-industry input-output linkages (robot adoption by upstream suppliers or downstream customers). We also test how these impacts are shaped by firms' absorptive capacity and external intellectual property right (IPR) protection. Our findings suggest that downstream robot adoption significantly drives firms' patent activities, whereas the impacts of robot adoption by peer firms and upstream suppliers are not statistically significant. Furthermore, the impact of robot adoption by downstream customers is magnified when firms have greater absorptive capacities and benefit from stronger IPR protection. We also exploit a policy change in 2012 related to high-end intelligent equipment manufacturing as a quasi-natural experiment to identify the effects of robot adoption as a form of technological disruption through different channels. Our study contributes to the literature on how technological disruption and associated uncertainties in the intra- and inter-industry linkages affect firms' patent activities.",2024,Business & Economics,0

ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND PHARMACEUTICAL PATENTS: FULFILLING THE PROMISE OF TRIPS ARTICLE 31BIS,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PARAGRAPH 6 SYSTEM; PUBLIC-HEALTH; TRADE; WTO; BIOSIMILARS; PROTECTION; POLITICS; CANADA; DRUGS,"The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) has long stood accused of reducing access to medicines for the poorest and most vulnerable nations. Enacted in 1994 as one of the founding pillars of the World Trade Organization, TRIPS has enabled pharmaceutical companies to enforce their patent rights in almost every country, precluding cheaper generics from being distributed, save for very limited exceptions.But in 2001, TRIPS was amended expressly to address this issue, allowing countries with limited resources to lodge a formal request to obtain patented medicines at a sustainable cost. Generics manufacturers worldwide can answer this call, operating under the protection of a special export compulsory license that shields them from claims by the patent holder. And yet, this mechanism has been successfully utilized only once.In this Article, we explain why export compulsory licenses have failed and suggest reforms that would help fulfill their promise. First, we identify and analyze the factors that deter countries from making recourse to export compulsory licenses. Second, we argue that the only way for nations to use the current legal framework effectively is to act jointly through pooled procurement initiatives. Finally, we advance the view that TRIPS reform is necessary to unlock the potential of export compulsory licenses, proposing targeted amendments and explaining how these revisions would bolster the flow of patented pharmaceuticals from the Global North to the Global South.",2023,Government & Law,0
A balanced approach to standard-essential patent disputes: from the perspective of the sustainability of technological resources,standard-essential patents; technical standards; good faith; FRAND; injunction; standardization; sustainability; technological resource; ,"Standard -essential patents (SEPs) are closely linked to technical standards and have the nature of public products. The combination of patents as private property rights with technical standards as public goods magnifies the exclusivity of patent rights, may hinder the application of technical standards and gives rise to a large number of legal disputes. Two solutions have been developed to alleviate this tension: a strong protection model that emphasizes the property rights nature of patents and a sharing model that emphasizes the public goods nature of technology standards. However, both options are detrimental to the efficiency of the allocation of technological resources and have led to conflicts in judicial decisions worldwide. To reconcile such conflicts, the courts should interpret the fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory principle flexibly according to the status of the parties to re-establish an equal relationship between SEP holders and technical standard implementers, thereby promoting the parties ' voluntary conclusion of patent licensing contracts. Effective measures include strengthening the obligation to negotiate licences between SEP holders and technical standard implementers and applying the principle of good faith to avoid ' patent blackmail ' by patent holders and ' reverse blackmail ' by technical standard implementers. Moreover, courts should be careful when deciding whether to adjudicate global licensing matters between parties to avoid judicial deadlock. These measures will ultimately contribute to the sustainability of technological resource creation and exploitation.",2024,Government & Law,0

Using the panel data of Asia-Pacific countries, this paper empirically analyzes the effect of economic openness level on international technological innovation and the moderating mechanism of the domestic patent application on them. The results show that the promotion effect of economic openness level on international technological innovation is different in countries with different income levels. With the increase of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), the domestic patent application displays a promotion effect on Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application. Due to the improvement of intellectual property protection in middle-high-income countries, more and more foreign investors are attracted to invest in those countries and then learn from the new technologies brought by foreign capital. The technology spillover effect of FDI is more obvious in middle-high-income countries. With the increase of Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI), the domestic patent application can promote PCT application in high-income and middle-high-income countries.

Pharmaceutical patents: Cathartic or inhibiting,health; industry; Intellectual Property Law; patents; ,"The debate between patent rights of pharmaceutical firms and the rights of the poor to equal access to health is an old one. The basic purpose of any patent system that grants a temporary monopoly to an innovator is to stimulate innovation and investment in the production of the newly innovated goods and services, which in turn gives supernormal profits to the innovator. However, the equity considerations dictate the spread of this knowledge in the public domain. The dilemma of the patent system is that, in encouraging R&D, it prevents the diffusion of innovation and consequently creates a non-competitive situation. This paper examines the impact of patent protection on the number of patent filings by the pharmaceutical companies in India after it signed the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and the trend in research and development expenditure by domestic firms. It questions the basis of this intellectual property right, especially, when a substantial amount of basic research is often carried out in the universities and federal funding is provided at the basic research and development level. It further investigates the success of various flexibilities provided under TRIPS which the Indian Patent Act has used and can potentially use, in comparison to other developed countries, to provide easy access to the medicines.

The impact of language translation quality on commerce: The example of patents,language translation; translation difficulty; polysemous words; international patenting; cultural context; INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS RESEARCH; MACHINE TRANSLATION; KNOWLEDGE; PERSPECTIVE; INDICATORS; CAPACITY,"Language matters, and it is an overwhelming stylized fact that language translation is an unavoidable part of global business. In this paper, we quantify the impact of translation difficulty reflected by the presence of multiple-meaning words in the original text. We focus on international patent applications because patent prosecution is nation-based. An inventor who seeks patent protection in a foreign jurisdiction with a different official language will need to file a translated version of the same document. Our estimates show that applications with more ambiguous original (English) text, are up to 25 percentage points less likely to receive a grant in the non-English jurisdictions (China, Japan, and South Korea). The results suggest that language translation difficulty can serve as a potential source of distortion in the global patent system. Ultimately, such translation difficulty may reduce the level of investment in global innovation activities, potentially leading to significant welfare loss. These findings serve to illustrate why international businesses should have adequate language translation strategy to address any translation difficulty arising from the presence of ambiguous words even when the deal involves the cross-border transfer of highly codified knowledge such as patents.",2024,Business & Economics,0

Technology Transfer and Imitation in a Cournot Oligopoly,Technology transfer; Technology licensing; Patents; Imitation; Consumer surplus; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PATENT BREADTH; COMPETITION; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; CONTRACT; POLICY; FEES,"I examine and compare patent licensing by fixed fee and unit royalty under Cournot competition. I consider licensing by an incumbent patent holder to one or two other competing firms that can obtain a patented technological improvement through technology transfer or imitation. Assuming that imitation is perfect, certain, instantaneous, and non-infringing, I analyze the effects of licensing on market structure, firms' individual profits, and consumer surplus. This provides a theoretical framework that explains when technology licensing is superior to imitation for both firms and consumers, what is the optimal licensing choice for firms, and how imitation affects firms' licensing behavior and competition in a highly concentrated industry. In particular, I show that licensing through a unit royalty is preferable to licensing through a fixed fee for a patent holder, while licensing through a fixed fee is at least as beneficial as licensing through a unit royalty for consumers. Moreover, the patent holder can use licensing to prevent imitation, but cannot use it selectively to affect competition, at least before the patent expires and when one of the competing firms can imitate. I contribute to the literature that considers the patent holder as a producer by showing how technology licensing can affect competition and improve consumer surplus in oligopolistic industries. This is important for policy makers to identify when technology licensing is used strategically to transfer surplus from consumers to producers.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Prescribing originality: investigating the impact of original knowledge on patent quality in the pharmaceutical sector,Innovation; Quality; Pharmaceuticals; Originality; Patents; O31; O30; L65; ,"Purpose This paper examines the relationship between the originality of a pharmaceutical innovation and its patent quality. Greater patent quality has been shown in the extant literature to enhance market value, which better enables firms to recoup research and development (R&D) expenditures incurred during the innovation process. Understanding how originality improves patent quality can assist policymakers, when determining the optimal length of pharmaceutical patent protection and/or market exclusivity. Design/methodology/approach The relationship between originality and patent quality is empirically investigated using a tobit, as well as a zero-inflated negative binomial, estimation approach to account for prevalence of patents receiving zero forward citations. Moderating effects of joint innovation, innovation by a university researcher and innovation by an established innovator on originality are also considered. Findings There is a robust and positive relationship between patent originality and quality in the pharmaceutical sector. This relationship is positively moderated by joint patent ownership with a university. As such, innovators that target originality in new drug development (especially those collaborating with universities) should, according to extant literature, see greater increases in their market value. Originality/value Policymakers can use information on the originality of a new drug to discern the optimal length of market exclusivity needed to enable the innovator to recoup expenditures related to R&D. Better predictions of the timing for which firms can recoup R&D expenditures will equip policymakers with knowledge about the appropriate timing to introduce competition into the market, which is critical to reducing the price of pharmaceuticals to consumers.",2021,Business & Economics,0
The remarkable development and significance of constitutional protection for intellectual property rights in post-Arab Spring constitutions,intellectual property; constitutions; constitutional protection; human rights; patents; access to medicines; Islamic law; Egypt; Tunisia; Arab Spring; globalization; postcolonialism; PATENTS; ACCESS; EGYPT; LAW,"Prior to the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, no constitutional protection for intellectual property (IP) existed in the many earlier constitutions of Egypt or Tunisia. It is remarkable and surprising therefore that, in 2014, IP clauses appeared in the post-revolutionary constitutions of both countries. This raises the key question: why add to the existing regulation of IP in this way. Is constitutional protection just another example of the inexorable strengthening of IP rights (IPRs) or could it be a means of constraining them, where necessary, to protect other rights? This article argues that including IP in a constitution may, rather than merely strengthening IP owners' rights, open IPRs up to competition against more fundamental constitutionally protected human rights and, for example, support the prioritization of the right to health. This could be a valid explanation for and potential use of the inclusion of IP in the Egyptian and Tunisian Constitutions.",2020,Government & Law,0

As a sensitive area with particularly fragile ecological environment, the Nordic countries took the lead in making the commitment of carbon neutrality by the middle of this century. The green industry will play an important role during this process. Based on the patent data related to the green industry in Nordic countries, this paper studies the evolution characteristics and dynamic changes of influencing factors of patent citation network from 1980 to 2019 by using the social network analysis method and exponential random graph model. The research results show that: Nordic green technologies have gradually changed from passive development to active innovation from the source, and gradually diversified and subdivided in the development process; the connectivity and transitivity of the patent citation network are good and relatively stable in the evolution process; the connections of Nordic countries with non-Nordic countries are strong and gradually spread to distant regions; the awareness of patent property rights protection has gradually increased, and industry and academia are increasingly integrated, which all promote the formation of patent citation relationship.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
India Declines Patent Extension Application of Bedaquiline: A Remarkable Step Towards Tuberculosis Elimination,johnson & johnson; mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb); patent; extensively drug resistant (xdr); mdr-tb (multi drug resistant tuberculosis); tuberculosis; bedaquiline; ,"In a pivotal decision, an application to extend the patent on bedaquiline submitted by the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson was denied by the Indian Patent Office, an essential drug for the treatment of tuberculosis. This development marks the conclusion of eight years of drug exclusivity, potentially opening the door for generic and more affordable versions. Bedaquiline has been a game-changer in treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and has shown remarkable clinical efficacy. The refusal to extend the patent aligns with India's goal to eliminate TB by 2025 and may significantly contribute to making bedaquiline more accessible to those in need. This decision carries broader implications, establishing a precedent for improved availability of reasonably priced drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines for illnesses with widespread outbreaks in nations with limited resources. While patent protection is vital for stimulating innovation, mechanisms to ensure global accessibility to essential medications remain imperative. Further reduction of costs and growth of facilities for manufacturing to low-and middle-income countries are essential steps in this journey. This paper highlights the potential impact of the Indian Patent Office's decision on TB management, access to treatment, and global health initiatives.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,0
DEFECTIVE PATENT DEFERENCE,; SUPREME-COURT; CHEVRON; OFFICE; FOUNDATIONS; QUESTIONS; STANDARDS; SHADOW; RULES; PTO,"The Supreme Court's implicit deference to the Office of the Solicitor General in patent cases is well-documented: What the Solicitor General requests, the Solicitor General typically receives. But we know far less about how the Solicitor General arrives at these preferred policy positions, or why the Solicitor General comes to advocate for some outcomes over others. This is problematic. In practically every other corner of the administrative state, an agency earns substantial deference to its views only where robust procedural protections attend to the policymaking process, where the agency's outcome reflects its substantive expertise, and where the agency may, through presidential removal and election, be held politically accountable for its policy choices. Not so in patent law. The Patent Office has never claimed to exercise any substantive rulemaking power. Meanwhile, the Solicitor General develops and advocates for patent policy outcomes, but behind closed doors, without deep internal expertise, and under the time constraints of appellate litigation. These shortcomings (among others) suggest that we should reexamine the Solicitor General's influence over patent policy in favor of alternate interpretive practices that improve Executive Branch decisionmaking. And they counsel in favor of several reforms most importantly, to the policymaking power of the Patent Office.",2020,Government & Law,0
Prediction of patent grant and interpreting the key determinants: an application of interpretable machine learning approach,Patent grant; Interpretable machine learning; Predictive models; EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; MARKET; US; CLASSIFICATION; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; OUTCOMES; OFFICE; SCOPE,"Patents are valuable intellectual property only when granted by the governments, and failing to receive an official grant means disclosing valuable technologies and information, which otherwise would be kept as commercial secrets. Yet, a typical patent application process takes years to complete and the outcome is uncertain. This study implements machine learning models to predict patent examination outcomes based on early information disclosed at patent publication and interpret the mechanism of how these models make predictions, highlighting the key determinants to patent grant and delineating the relationships between the patent features and the examination outcome. The predictive models that integrate patent-level variables with textual information accomplish the best prediction performances with a 0.854 ROC-AUC score and 77% accuracy rate. A number of interpretable machine learning methods are applied. The permutation-based feature importance metric identifies key determinants such as applicants' prior experience, page length, backward citation, claim counts, number of patent family, etc. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a local interpretability method, describes the marginal contributions to the model prediction of key predictors using two actual patent examples. Our study provides several valuable findings with important theoretical insights and practical applications. Specifically, we show that patent-level information can serve as a predictor of examination outcomes and the relationships between the predictors and outcome variables are complex. Knowledge accumulation and technology complexity positively affect the likelihood of patent grants, albeit with a curvilinear relationship. At lower levels, both factors significantly increase the chance of a grant, but beyond a certain threshold, the marginal effect becomes less pronounced. Additionally, prior experience, patent family size, and engagement with the patent agency have a monotonic and positive relationship with the grant likelihood, whereas the impact of patent scope on patent grants remains uncertain. While a narrower and more specific patent claim is associated with a higher grant rate, the number of claims increases it. Moreover, technology range, inventor team size, and examination duration have little effect on the patent grant results. From a practical standpoint, the accurate prediction of patent grants has significant potential applications. For instance, it could help firms better prioritize resources on the patent applications of high grant potentials to secure the final grant, as failure means a waste of R & D effort and disclosure of technology without IP protection. Additionally, patent examiners could utilize our predictive results as prior knowledge to enhance their judgment and accelerate the examination process.",2023,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,0

Nonlinearities in the Intellectual Property-Manufacturing Growth Nexus in the Post-TRIPS Era: Evidence from a Dynamic Panel Analysis,Manufacturing; Intellectual property rights; Innovation; System GMM; O14; O34; O31; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; RIGHTS; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; INVESTMENTS; SPILLOVERS; PATENTS; GMM,"Discussions around the importance of intellectual property (IP) intensified at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as countries raced to secure IP-protected goods (e.g., vaccines and medical equipment) necessary to respond quickly and adequately to the threat of the virus' spread. Building on the growing strand of the literature that reexamines IP's effect on an array of social and economic outcomes, this paper examines the relationship between quantitative (patents and trademarks) and qualitative (IP protection) measures of IP, on the one hand, and manufacturing growth, on the other hand, accounting for the presence of nonlinearities. Using a two-step system generalized method of moments (SGMM) approach on a panel dataset of 81 countries spanning the post-1995 TRIPS Agreement period, our estimates show that these alternative measures of IP have differential and nonlinear effects on manufacturing growth. In particular, patents have a positive significant marginal effect on manufacturing growth past a minimum scale, whereas trademarks do not have a significant effect. In contrast, stronger IPR protection has a positive effect only up to a critical level of IPR protection, implying that too much IPR protection can stifle growth-inducing competing innovation. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on the mechanisms through which IP may contribute to manufacturing growth, and on some policies, which may help realize this potential. Broadly, this paper speaks to academic and policy discussions surrounding optimal IP enforcement and the benefits and consequences of IP.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Private and public values of innovation: A patent analysis of synthetic biology,Value mapping; Patent documents; Patenting; Synthetic biology; Private value; Public value; INDICATORS; SCIENCE; CONTROVERSY; PROTECTION; CITATIONS; EMERGENCE; INSIGHTS; SYSTEMS; UK,"Emerging science and technology fields are increasingly expected to provide solutions to societal grand challenges. The promise of such solutions frequently underwrites claims for the public funding of research. In parallel, universities, public research organizations and, in particular, private enterprises draw on such research to actively secure property rights over potential applications through patenting. Patents represent a claim to garner financial returns from the novel outcomes of science and technology. This is justified by the potential social value promised by patents as they encourage information sharing, further R&D investment, and the useful application of new knowledge. Indeed, the value of patents has generated longstanding academic interest in innovation studies with many scholars investigating its determinants based on econometric models. Yet, this research has largely focused on evaluating factors that influence the market value of patents and the gains from exclusivity rights granted to inventions, which reflect the private value of a patent. However, the patent system is a socially shaped enterprise where private and public concerns intersect. Despite the notion of the social utility of inventions as a patenting condition, and evidence of disconnection between societal needs and the goals of private actors, less attention has been paid to other interpretations of patent value. This paper investigates the various articulations of value delineated by patents in an emerging science and technology domain. As a pilot study, we analyse patents in synthetic biology, contributing a new analytical framework and classification of private and public values at the intersections of science, economy, and society. After considering the legal, business, social and political dimensions of patenting, we undertake a qualitative and systematic examination of patent content in synthetic biology. Our analysis probes the private and public value propositions that are framed in these patents in terms of the potential private and public benefits of research and innovation. Based on this framework, we shed light on questions of what values are being nurtured in inventions in synthetic biology and discuss how attention to public as well as private values opens up promising avenues of research in science, technology and innovation policy.",2020,Business & Economics,0

Using data from 34 countries, we find that firms in countries where strong-FTR languages are spoken have fewer patent counts and citations than those in countries where weak-FTR languages are spoken. Further evidence shows that strong-FTR languages affect inventors' perceptions and beliefs about future rewards from innovation. Moreover, due to interactions between people speaking different languages, globalization attenuates the negative impact of language FTR on innovation. To further support these findings, we provide evidence from a single country with a multilingual environment to control for omitted country-level characteristics.

An ordered probit analysis corrected for sample selection bias, estimates performance to derive the following conclusions. First, trademarks and out-licensing IP types increase a firm's chances of being a high performer, confirming the importance of certain forms of IP protection for start-ups. Second, patenting significantly reduces the chances of being a high performer, suggesting patenting has limited performance benefits for start-ups. Third, few performance synergies exist in the joint use of IP types, suggesting that strong complementarities among IP types are limited. While out-licensing patents and out-licensing copyrights increase performance, out-licensing patents and out-licensing trademarks diminish it. Furthermore, registering more trademarks and out-licensing more trademarks also diminishes performance, suggesting start-up firms should keep trademarks in-house.",2021,Business & Economics,0
Intellectual property-related preferential trade agreements and US offshoring to developing countries,multinational firms; patents; preferential trade agreements; outsourcing; subcontracting; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PATENT RIGHTS; PROTECTION; CREATION; FIRMS; LABOR,International standards in the protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs) are increasingly guided by bilateral and regional preferential trade agreements (PTAs). We estimate the effect of these IP-related PTAs on US offshoring in developing countries. We utilize a difference-in-difference empirical methodology that addresses several sources of endogeneity and exploits industry variation in the importance of IPRs. IP-related PTAs are associated with a substantial increase in US offshoring in IP-intensive industries relative to non-IP-intensive industries. This increase is concentrated within the boundaries of the multinational firm. PTA-induced IPRs reform impacts both the intensity and composition of multinational activity in developing countries.,2023,Business & Economics,0

The influence of the number of patents on the economic growth of the country - evidence from Serbia and Hungary,Patents; innovation; GDP per capita; economic growth; INNOVATION; IMPACT; COMPETITIVENESS; PROTECTION,"Background: One of the indicators of a country's innovation is the total number of registered patents. This paper analyzes the number of registered patents and the impact they can have on the country's economic growth and innovation. Purpose: The paper aims to determine whether there is a positive impact of market verification of the results of research and development activities, measured by the number of patents per million inhabitants, on economic growth and the growth of innovation in the country. Study design/methodology/approach: Quantitative research design was applied in the analysis since the task was to investigate the influence of the number of patents on the economic growth of the country. The empirical research covered two countries - Serbia and Hungary. It used secondary data from the international databases of the World Bank and World Intellectual Property Organization, covering the period from 2008 to 2018. Finding/conclusions: The results of the empirical research showed that the increase in the number of patents per million inhabitants contributes only to the innovation index's growth in Hungary. On the other hand, in the case of Serbia, there is no statistically significant relationship between the number of patents per million inhabitants and the country's innovation index, or the number of patents per million inhabitants and GDP per capita. Limitations/future research: The limitations are: the small number of analyzed countries and the number of indicators analyzed. Therefore, in the framework of future research, it would be desirable to expand the analysis to more countries and establish the impact of patents on more indicators of innovation.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Assessing the efficacy of green credit policy in fostering green innovation in heavily polluting industries,Green innovation; Green credit policy; Financial constraints; DID model; Green patents; ,"This paper explores the impact of green credit policy on the green innovation of heavily polluting enterprises by taking the implementation of the Green Credit Guidelines in 2012 in China as an exogenous shock. Using the sample of industrial enterprises from the Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database, our empirical results show that, after 2012, the quantity of green innovation represented by the number of green utility model patents and green invention patents is significantly reduced in heavily polluting enterprises. The quality of green innovation represented by the knowledge complexity of green patents increases significantly. The conclusions are valid in a series of robustness tests. The implementation of green credit policy strengthens both the internal financial constraints and the external financial constraints of heavily polluting enterprises. Mediating effect tests reveal that the strengthened internal financial constraints hinder green innovation, while the strengthened external financial constraints promote the knowledge complexity of green patents. There are also firm-level and region-level heterogeneities. The negative effect of green credit policy does not differ between the listed enterprises and non-listed enterprises. It is greater on the green invention patents of the non-state-owned firms. The green innovation of the foreign-owned enterprises declines in all aspects: green utility model patents, green invention patents, and knowledge complexity. Regional intellectual property protection can only significantly mitigate the negative effect on the green utility model patents.Graphical abstractImpact of green credit policy on green innovation",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

We provide plausibly causal evidence that processing costs of financial disclosures, which inform users of the economic value of innovation, play a key role in firms' management of knowledge spillover. We exploit an exogenous, randomly assigned, and staggered policy shock by the SEC that reduces processing costs of mandatory financial disclosures. In response, firms reduce patenting rates, with the effect concentrated among firms in more competitive industries and with lower costs of capital. Firms also reduce their patent disclosure quality. Our results suggest firms rely more on trade secrecy as their innovation property protection mechanism. Lower processing costs of financial disclosures affect neither innovation inputs nor voluntary disclosure practices.

Unveiling patenting strategies of therapeutics and vaccines: evergreening in the context of COVID-19 pandemic,Evergreening; COVID-19; health technologies; SARS-CoV-2; patenting strategies; monopoly; patent examination; ,"In the pharmaceutical sector, evergreening is considered a range of practices applied to extend monopoly protection on existing products. Filing several patent applications related to the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is one of the most common manifestations of evergreening. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several health technologies were developed. This study aimed to analyze the extension of evergreening for selected health technologies for SARS-CoV-2 through patent filing strategies. Starting with the selection of three antivirals, one biological and two vaccines, a patent landscape was built based on public and private databases. Regarding these selected technologies, we analyzed some of the evergreening strategies used by different applicants, academic institutions or pharmaceutical companies and found a total of 29 applications (10 after the pandemic) for antivirals, 3 applications for a biological drug (1 after the pandemic), and 41 applications for vaccines (23 after the pandemic). Despite differences among the technologies, a common aspect found in all analyzed cases is the intense patent filing after the pandemic, aligned to the fact that those technologies were moving through the R&D process up to regulatory approval. The evergreening approach pursued has already been found in other diseases, with the risk of monopoly extension and also bringing legal uncertainty due to the lack of transparency of newer patent applications covering specific medical indications. Therefore, efforts to address evergreening should be pursued by countries, including the adoption of a public health approach to the patent examination of those technologies to prevent the granting of undeserved patents.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,0
THE PATENT WRITTEN DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENT: A REQUIREMENT IN SEARCH OF A DESCRIPTION,; ,"Innovation often requires a hefty investment of time and money. The patent system exists to incentivize innovation by granting inventors the exclusive use of their invention for a set period of time. In return, the public receives the benefit of the inventor's knowledge, as well as the use of the invention once the exclusivity period ends. One of the hurdles for obtaining a patent is the written description requirement, which demands that the inventor disclose enough information to prove that they actually invented what they are seeking patent protection for. This requirement serves to prevent an undeserving inventor from obtaining the right to exclude the public from using a technology that they did not actually invent.The written description requirement has a reputation for being poorly defined and unpredictable. Recently, this requirement has become a popular target for parties defending against patent infringement suits, and patent practitioners have raised concerns that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is applying an increasingly heightened standard. This Note discusses two recent cases in which the Federal Circuit invalidated patents for insufficient written descriptions. Each case considered a patent covering a drug for multiple sclerosis that the innovating party sought to assert against competitors hoping to manufacture lower-cost generics. This Note explores the Federal Circuit's reasoning for invalidating the patents and evaluates their treatment in light of precedent. It then proposes that the Federal Circuit establish a more concrete standard for the written description by adopting a goal-oriented approach to the requirement.",2023,Government & Law,0
Innovation-adjusted economic complexity and growth: Do patent flows reveal enhanced economic capabilities?,economic development; economic growth; innovation-adjusted ECI; INSTITUTIONS; INDICATORS,"Understanding economic growth has been a primary pursuit for generations of economists. Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, 10570-10575) charted new territory in this pursuit by using bipartite international trade networks to characterize the economic complexity of a country based on the capabilities implied by the products it exports. The resulting Economic Complexity Index (ECI) correlates strongly with income levels and predicts subsequent economic growth with some statistical precision. We propose an innovation-adjusted ECI (i-ECI) that uses a high-resolution patent-trade concordance to construct trade networks weighted by domestic and international patent application flows. The i-ECI thus reflects firms' decisions about where to seek patent protection on industry-specific inventions, allows for heterogeneity in the relative importance of patenting across industries, and implicitly captures firms' perceived innovation potential in the recipient countries. Although the i-ECI is highly correlated with the ECI (correlation coefficient greater than 92%), it is a stronger and more statistically precise predictor of economic growth than the unadjusted ECI.",2022,Development Studies; Business & Economics,0

This study also examines the impact of industry-level competition on the debt financing orders and investigates how two exogenous shocks impacted on innovative firms' financing policies. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the three types of debt data, including bonds, private debt placements and bank loans and patent application data, in the USA from 1987-2008. The number of patents applications and industry-level competition are used as proxies for a firm's innovation and industry-level sensitivity. In addition, to minimize endogenous concern, this study uses the propensity score matching analysis and difference-in-differences. Findings The patents are the primary determinants for innovative firms to choose the debt types. The paper shows that innovative firms have the debt preference order - public debt, private placement and bank loans. However, as competition increases, innovative firms devise the order reverse. Finally, the paper provides evidence that the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA) and the tech bubble crash made investors depend more on firms with more patents. Originality/value This paper is the first to study the impact of the AIPA on innovative firms' financial policies using the propensity score matching analysis. The findings imply that both patents and industry-level competition are important factors to understand the capital structures for innovative firms.",2021,Business & Economics,0

Long-term hybrid galvanic corrosion protection of reinforced-concrete structures,concrete structures/corrosion/maintenance; inspection; CATHODIC PROTECTION,"Hybrid corrosion protection (HCP) can be used to provide corrosion arrest and prevention in degrading reinforced-concrete structures to increase their service life. The proprietary technology is a relatively new electrochemical treatment for concrete structures, having been patented in 2005 ( patent GB2426008B). Due to this fact, accurate and reliable empirical data over the life span of a structure protected by an HCP system does not yet exist. This paper is the first to present over 10 years of empirical data, from one of the very first installations of HCP, providing a rigorous and reliable assessment of the structure's long-term performance. Results demonstrate that hybrid galvanic anodes exhibit a responsive behaviour to maintain the concrete environment and respond to corrosion hazards. Even after prolonged periods of low current output, the anodes respond to changing environmental conditions, providing the higher current output required to afford the necessary polarisation to the reinforcement, and hence the protection to the structure. Steel potentials also continued to trend towards more positive values, a generally agreed indication of passive reinforcement.

Design/methodology/approach This paper analyzes the OEM's optimal decisions of remanufacturability level in the product design and unit patent licensing fee at the first period, as well as the OEM's and the 3PR's optimal decisions of selling prices at the second period, under two scenarios that the remanufacturing is constrained or unconstrained by the collected quantity available at the end of the first period, by making use of game theory. Findings The study finds that the OEM will choose high remanufacturability in product design only when the unit cost saving of remanufacturing or unit production cost of new products exceed certain thresholds. Originality/value The study is the first attempt to simultaneously integrate product design and patent licensing in remanufacturing. It provides useful insights for OEM managers who face competition from 3PRs and may use their product design strategies to deter 3PRs and may protect patent of products by levying patent licensing fees from 3PRs.",2022,Computer Science,0

The analysis of the HEV patent lifecycle is crucial for understanding its impact on the development of this technology. This lifecycle tracks the progress of HEV technologies from their inception and patenting, through their market adoption, and to the expiration of their patent protection. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the technology lifecycle of the HEV industry using the growth S-curve method. The purpose of this study is to describe the technological lifecycle trajectory and current stage of the HEV industry, as well as the technical stages of each sub-technology, to facilitate better decision making. As part of this study, we used patent family data collected from the Derwent Innovation Index database from 1975 to 2022 and established an S-curve model for HEVs and their sub-technologies using logistic regression. In 2022, the technological maturity of HEVs reached 44%. The sub-technologies with the most substantial diffusion capabilities are energy management, propulsion systems, and cooling circuits. According to predictions, the saturation period for the patent family quantity related to HEVs is estimated to be around 53 years.",2024,Engineering; Transportation,0
The Impact of R&D Intensity on the Innovation Performance of Artificial Intelligence Enterprises-Based on the Moderating Effect of Patent Portfolio,R&D intensity; patent portfolio; innovation performance; regression analysis; artificial intelligence enterprise; ,"The patent portfolio affects the research and development (R&D) decisions of artificial intelligence enterprises, and provides rights protection for the enterprise's product market, which is of great practical significance for the realization of innovation performance. The aim of this paper is to discover how the patent portfolio of artificial intelligence enterprises affects the relationship between R&D intensity and innovation performance. Based on the panel data of 164 listed enterprises in the A-share artificial intelligence concept sector of China, using the panel fixed effect regression method, the impact of R&D intensity on innovation performance was analyzed, and the moderating effect of the three dimensions of the patent portfolio on the two was examined. Studies have shown that the impact of R&D intensity on innovation performance is in an inverted U-shaped relationship. In addition, the diversity characteristics of the patent portfolio have a moderating effect on the relationship between R&D intensity and innovation performance, and when the enterprise is at a high level of diversity, the two have a U-shaped flip relationship. The size of the patent portfolio has a positive impact on innovation performance. The research results have theoretical and practical significance for the implementation of effective R&D management in artificial intelligence enterprise organizations.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Trade protection and firm innovation in China,Trade protection; Innovation; Financial constraint; F51; O31; FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS; POLICY UNCERTAINTY; PRODUCTIVITY; IMPORTS; IMPACT; RISK,"PurposeThe author investigates the effect of trade protection on domestic firm innovation in China and explores the channel through which trade protection affects corporate innovation.Design/methodology/approachUsing a sample of Chinese A-share manufacturing companies from 2003 to 2019, the author starts with a univariate analysis by examining the innovation output after trade protection for all samples. The author uses the natural logarithm of one plus the number of trade protection cases received by the industry to which the firm belongs in a particular year to proxy for trade protection.FindingsThe author finds that trade protection significantly encourages firms' patent application, particularly substantive patents, which is stronger in non-state-owned enterprises. Moreover, the mitigation of financial constraint is plausible channel that allows trade protection to promote innovation.Practical implicationsFor practitioners, they should seize the dividends of national policies. In the process of implementing trade protection, they should concentrate on improving their innovation level and enhancing their core competitiveness. When they are not subject to trade protection, they can also make profits and develop in the long run.Social implicationsFor policy makers, in the early stage of industry development, trade protection can be used to ease the companies' financing constraints and improve the companies' profits, which will help them concentrate their efforts, promote innovation and further develop. However, in the mid-term development of the industry, policy makers should reduce trade protection. Through the entry of foreign capital, companies face increased competition, which can enhance the companies' motivation for long-term development.Originality/valueOverall, this paper sheds light on the real effects of trade protection and the determinants of innovation. First, the paper sheds light on the impact of international trade on firms' innovation. Second, this study also contributes to the emerging literature on the effect of trade policy uncertainty on financial constraint. Third, the paper adds to the stream of literature on the drivers of innovation.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Working/non-working status of patents granted to HEIs and NRLs in India,Granted patents; higher educational institutions; knowledge economy; national research laboratories; ,"The era of knowledge economy has seen a transition in the business market, from the need to control raw materials towards the protection of ideas, either as tangible or non-tangible assets. These assets may be secured in the form of various intellectual property (IP) instruments such as patents, know-how or technologies. These IP instruments (patents) not only give the IP owners (patentees) a monopoly over the use of their ideas/inventions, but also mandate them to commercially exploit the same for the benefit of the population at large. While economically developed countries (like China, USA, South Korea, Japan, etc.) appreciate this fact, developing countries like India are yet to make their mark in this transition; thus it is imperative to evaluate the IP landscape of the country. It is well acknowledged that major contributors to fundamental research in any country are the higher educational institutions (HEIs) and national research laboratories (NRLs). Hence, this study evaluates the patent commercialization ecosystem of Indian HEIs (351) and NRLs (553) for the period January 2010 to December 2017, based on the working statements filed by the patentees/assignees in the prescribed Form-27 at the Indian Patent Office.",2021,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
The construction of patent claims,intellectual property law; patents; claims construction; Coase theorem; ,"This paper highlights two recurring facets of the way UK courts approach the construction of patent claims: the adoption of methods typically applied to the interpretation of contracts and the recognition that immaterial variations not expressly claimed nevertheless fall within the scope of protection. Drawing on the normative implications arising out of Ronald Coase's paper on the problem of social cost, this paper argues that the patent system operates as a substitute for an explicit bargain between economically active entities operating in the market under which a duty is accepted by one party in return for acceptance of a burden of risk by the other. This perspective incorporates both the static costs and the dynamic benefits of the system and accords with the monopoly-profit-incentive theory most commonly advanced in support of the patent system. It is shown how the contemporary approach to claims construction is supported by the object of giving effect to the presumed intentions of the parties to this hypothetical bargain and that this underpins both the implication of terms which go beyond those expressly agreed to by parties to a contract and the construction of patent claims so as to embrace immaterial variations not expressly within their scope.",2020,Government & Law,0
Analysis of Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) and Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP) Manufacturing Waivers and Their Impact on Pharmaceutical Industry,Certificate of supplementary protection; Manufacturing waiver; Patent term extension; Supplementary protection certificate; USFDA; ,"Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) is a type of Intellectual Property Right which extends the patent term and is applicable to approved specific pharmaceutical and plant protection products in European Union (EU). On 01 July 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/933 of 20 May 2019 concerning SPC came into force. It is also referred as the SPC manufacturing waiver Regulation and was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 11 June 2019. Similarly, Canada also introduced Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP) Regulations on 21 September 2017. It is governed by provisions in the Canadian Patent Act and the CSP Regulations. These developments would have impact on global pharmaceutical industry including United States of America (US). US being the largest pharmaceutical market, policy making in US has direct and indirect impact on global pharmaceutical industry. Thus, it is important to study SPC or CSP manufacturing waiver in light of the developments in the USA. On 30 October 2019, United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) released a report on Drug Shortages. Apart from identifying root causes for drug shortages, the Report also recommended enduring solutions to maintain or enhance the quality of medicines and manufacturing facilities. This research work compares EU and Canadian SPC/CSP manufacturing waiver developments with each other. In-depth analysis of the impact of these SPC/CSP manufacturing waivers on competition amongst pharmaceutical companies, economic impact on patients and pharmaceutical companies, swifter access to generic medicines, rise of new generic companies has been carried out. The impact of suggestion from USFDA to create a rating system for manufacturing facilities in light of these SPC/CSP manufacturing waiver is also studied. It was observed that there are few important differences between these manufacturing waivers of EU and Canada. These waivers would have an impact on the manufacturing facilities of pharmaceutical product. It could change the manufacturing clusters like China and India, which exists today and would increase the competition amongst the pharmaceutical manufactures. It is likely to help reduce the cost of generic medicines especially in USA and EU region.",2020,Government & Law,0
"Surveyed impact of intellectual property training in STEM education on innovation, research, and development",academic patenting; intellectual property courses; technology transfer; university patenting; PATENT LIFE,"This paper analyzes the findings of an international survey questionnaire to which responses were received from over 500 members from different technical societies of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The survey is primarily intended to uncover members' perceptions of patent filing and research-driven innovation. Our thesis statement is twofold. First, the introduction of basic intellectual property (IP) courses to university Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics curricula would teach students valuable basics of IP and associated issues, technology protection; and possibly stimulate novel/innovative R&D outcomes. Second, studying relevant active/lapsed/expired patent documents could provide stimulating input for ongoing academic research. After analyzing the survey results we conclude that IP coursework could be a catalyst for students and researchers to explore patent opportunities related to their specific interests. The resulting knowledge would further enable researchers to prepare more compelling funding applications. In our experience, IEEE conference publications are often closely aligned with inventions to solve pressing technical problems. Conference papers typically comprise of cutting-edge research/industry findings, with a short time between paper submission and presentation. Furthermore, conference organizers choose themes representing the forefront of technologies that often lead to inventions. These could fuel patent developments, but academic research environments often provide little if any incentives for academic researchers to prepare and file patent applications. Indeed, the attainment of high impact journal publications remains the primary metric by which research activity is judged and future academic tenure achieved.",2020,Government & Law,0

Our findings suggest that enhanced judicial protection of IP has a positive impact on corporate digital innovation, and that it contributes more to underlying digital technology innovation. Moreover, small firms are more likely to be affected by judicial protection of IP in their digital innovation activities than large firms.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Patent law reform and innovation: An empirical assessment of the last 20 years,Patent; Policy change; Litigation; U.S; LITIGATION; EBAY,"We ask whether four of the most important U.S. patent system reforms of the last 20 years-elimination of presumptive injunctive relief for victorious patent enforcers in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC , 547 U.S. 388 (2006); creation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) in the America Invents Act; restriction of software's eligibility for patent protection in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int 'l , 573 U.S. 208 (2014); and limitation of patent enforcers' choice of forum in TC Heartland, LLC v. Kraft Foods Grp. Brands, LLC , 137 S.

We find: a positive association between eBay and R &D spending by firms that were relatively more exposed to patent litigation prior to the Court's decision; a positive association between the introduction of PTAB proceedings and R &D expenditures by firms that innovate in tech classes where PTAB has been most active; a positive association between Alice and R &D spending by software firms; and a positive association between TC Heartland and R &D spending by firms that thereafter could not be sued in the Eastern District of Texas, a court long associated with opportunistic forum shopping.",2024,Business & Economics; Government & Law,0

This relationship is stronger after the implementation of patent boxes that provide preferential tax treatment for patent income. Moreover, innovative multinationals facing higher repatriation taxes accumulate higher total cash holdings. The positive innovativeness-cash relationship varies with institutional environments and is more pronounced in countries with higher R&D tax credits, less developed financial markets, better governance, stronger shareholder rights, more technicians, better infrastructure, greater investment freedom, and in industries with fiercer competition and longer innovation cycles. Innovative firms with higher cash holdings invest more in R&D and generate more patents. Overall, our findings provide insights into the driving forces underlying the large cash accumulation in innovative firms worldwide.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Trading in Information: On the Unlikely Correspondence Between Patents and Blackmail Law,Adverse selection; Appropriability problem; Blackmail; Patents; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; PROPERTY-RIGHTS,"This paper studies the problem of trading in information in two seemingly unrelated settings: inventive activity; and blackmail. In the former, a discoverer of some new information wishes to profit from it but may be deterred because the act of disclosure effectively makes the information public. Thus, legal protection of the information in the form of a patent is usually needed to allow the inventive process to proceed. Blackmail also involves trading in information; but because the transaction is between two parties who already know its content-the discoverer, and someone who wishes to keep it hidden-the appropriability problem is absent. The paradox of blackmail is why the blackmailer prefers to sell the information to the informed party rather than to the uninformed party (who actually values it more); this latter transaction would be legal. The resolution of the paradox provides the link to patent law, because the latter transaction does involve the appropriability problem.",2020,Business & Economics,0

Scholars and practitioners recognize the importance of technological innovation in a firm's ability to obtain a sustainable competitive advantage. However, the empirical findings on the overarching relationship between technological innovation and firm performance remain inconclusive. Thus, in this article, we attempt to reconcile the mixed empirical results on the relationship by employing a multivariate meta-analytic methodology. We find that technological innovation has a significant and positive impact on a firm's performance. Furthermore, we find empirical support for the moderating influence of cross-cultural and institutional differences on the relationship. We observed a better performance outcome for innovation occurring in nations with a lower propensity to avoid uncertainty and collectivistic attitudes. In contrast, performance suffers when technological innovation occurs in nations that have stronger patent protection.",2022,Business & Economics; Engineering,0
Proprietary Costs: Why Do R&D-Active Firms Choose Single-Lender Financing?,proprietary costs; R&D-active firms; single-lender financing; American Inventor's Protection Act; financing innovation; PRODUCT-MARKET COMPETITION; CORPORATE DISCLOSURE; ACCOUNTING INFORMATION; PATENT PUBLICATION; EARNINGS QUALITY; CREDITOR RIGHTS; PRIVATE; INCENTIVES; INVESTMENT; INNOVATION,"We examine whether proprietary costs drive R&D-active firms' choice of private loan structure. We find that R&D-active firms are more likely to choose single-lender over multi-lender private loan financing. This is consistent with the theory that high-ability entrepreneurs protect their proprietary knowledge by communicating it to a single lender while disclosing generic and less sensitive information to the public. This propensity, however, significantly decreases after the enactment of the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA), which accelerated public disclosure of firms' patent details in filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This accelerated public disclosure potentially caused R&D information to spill over to rivals, increasing the proprietary costs of single-lender borrowers. AIPA enactment also increased the spread on R&D-active firms' single-lender loans. These findings contribute to the voluntary disclosure and financing choice literature by linking R&D-active firms' choice of singlelender financing to the proprietary costs of public disclosure.",2022,Business & Economics,0
The law applicable to the right of priority from a European perspective,right of priority; patents; Paris convention; European Patent Convention; TRIPS; applicable law; ,"The right of priority established in the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property allows a patent applicant to claim the filing date of a first application for any subsequent applications for the same invention filed within twelve months in another Paris Convention Contracting State. This right may be claimed by the person who has filed an application or their successor in title. If priority is not validly claimed, patent applications and patents relying on the right may be rejected, revoked or invalidated. National and regional rules governing who may claim priority, whether a priority right may be divided or shared, whether it may be transferred independently of the priority application and the rights to the invention, and the requirements for a valid transfer differ from country to country. The issue of whether priority has been validly claimed may therefore depend on which country's law applies, which depends on the characterisation of the issues. The aim of this article is to provide a European perspective on the law applicable to the right of priority.",2024,Government & Law,0
"Transport development, intellectual property rights protection and innovation: The case of the Yangtze River Delta Region, China",Transport development and innovation; Transport governance; Transport management; Intellectual property rights protection; Economic agglomeration; Yangtze River Delta region; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PUBLIC TRANSPORT; INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT; ECONOMIC-BENEFITS; PATENT RIGHTS; TRADE; GOVERNANCE; AGGLOMERATION; COMPETITION; OWNERSHIP,"The links between transport development and economic growth have been widely discussed in the field of transport governance and economics. However, the existing studies have not included an institutional variable when exploring the role of transport development in innovation disparities within a region. In order to fill the research gap, this paper examines whether transport development and the institution of intellectual property rights (IPRs) can assist in understanding disparities between cities in terms of innovation, using the Yangtze River Delta Region (YRDR) as a case study. The impact mechanism is twofold. Firstly, transport development can affect institutions, including IPRs protection, which in turn has an influence on innovation. Secondly, evidence from existing economic literature suggests a link between transport development and innovation through economic agglomeration, production factors and industrial flows. We first employ ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to test the basic associations between transport development and innovation. We then apply two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression analysis to address endogeneity and add a spatial model to examine neighbour effects. The findings show that IPRs protection has a positive effect on patenting and research and development (R&D), while the roles played by transport development stock and density in patenting and R&D are more mixed. Moreover, our findings on neighbour effects show that agglomeration economies exist in the YRDR. These findings have important policy implications regarding urban agglomeration for both the YRDR specifically and China overall.",2020,Business & Economics; Transportation,0
Analysis of Trends in the Development of 3D Printing Technologies with Metal-Based Powder Materials,additive technologies; 3D printing; patent protection; patent review; selective laser melting; laser cladding; metal powder; metal structure; mechanical properties; ,"This article presents the results of the analysis of the patent situation in the field of 3D printing technologies with metals and materials based on them and the prospects for their development. In the development of the life cycle of patenting laser additive technologies in Russia in 2000-2020, three main stages can be distinguished, namely, Stage I for 2000-2008, Stage II for 2009-2015, and Stage III for 2016-2020. In terms of the applicability of patent solutions in the field of laser additive technologies, the most developed industries are the mechanical engineering and metallurgical industries. The leaders of patenting in the Russian Federation territory are BASF and Siemens (Germany) and Airbus Operation (France). The leading countries where applicants strive to obtain patents are the USA, Russia, China, Japan, and the countries of the European Union. Three main directions can be distinguished among the main trends in the development of laser additive technologies: development of basic cultivation technologies (development of effective technological modes) of products and technologies of combined processing (e.g., deformation, thermal, and thermal-deformation); development of devices and equipment for additive manufacturing, including special equipment that ensures high-quality geometric parameters and improves the performance properties of the product during the production process; and development and creation of new powder materials and their compositions with a given granulometric composition and technologies for their production.",2023,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,0
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Flexibilities and Public Health: Implementation of Compulsory Licensing Provisions into National Patent Legislation,intellectual property; patent; public health; ,"Context: The protection of intellectual property (IP) rights, given international legal effect through the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of IP Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, has long been a contentious issue. In recent years, the long-standing debate on IP rights as a barrier to the access of affordable medicines has been heightened by the global vaccine inequity evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The TRIPS Agreement contains a number of flexibilities that WTO members can exploit in order to accommodate their policy needs. Among these is the mechanism of compulsory licensing, whereby patent licenses may be granted without consent of the patent holder in certain circumstances. TRIPS Article 31bis created a special mechanism for compulsory licenses specifically for the export of pharmaceutical products to countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity.Methods: We analyzed domestic patent legislation for 195 countries (193 UN members and two observers) and three customs territories. We analyzed patent legislation for provisions on compulsory licenses, including those defined in Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement.Findings: We identified 11 countries with no patent legislation. Of the 187 countries with domestic or regional patent laws, 176 (94.1%) had provisions on compulsory licensing and 72 (38.5%) had provisions implementing TRIPS Article 31bis.Conclusions: The results of this study have highlighted the gap in the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities in countries' national patent legislation, especially in least-developed countries. Although it will not fully solve patent barriers to the access of medicines, implementation of compulsory licensing (and specifically those for the import and export of pharmaceutical products) will provide governments with another tool to safeguard their population's public health. Further discussions are needed to determine whether the WTO can provide effective responses to future pandemics or global crises.",2023,Health Care Sciences & Services,0
Factors impacting patent applications in European countries,developing countries; patent applications; small and medium enterprises; ,"The paper investigates the gap in the number of patent applications by European countries in the period 2010-2018. During the observed period, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) received an average of 1.9 applications per million inhabitants per year from the countries of the Western Balkans (WB-5), which is as much as 98% less than the average for the whole of Europe. The purpose of the paper is to create a model for increasing the number of patent applications in developing countries, which should lead to a higher number of granted patents. The author analyses variables that have an impact on the number of the patent applications (functional literacy, human development index, university/industry research collaboration, and gross domestic spending on R&D) in the developed (EU-28) and developing (WB-5) countries. The WB-5 firms, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), do not use of the opportunities offered by intellectual property (IP) protection. They find the system too costly, complex, and difficult to manage. Based on the results of statistical analyses and conclusions from recent literature that tackles the usage of IP, the author builds a model for increasing the number of patent applications among European SMEs that is based on the support of international business support organizations (BSOs). Moreover, the author recognizes the positive impact of international IP support programmes (such as EU IPR Helpdesk ambassador scheme) on the work of local BSOs that deal with IP rights.",2021,Geography,0

Irrespective of whether the R or S enantiomer is the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), a drug is more often marketed in its racemic form. Drug developers state a number of reasons for the racemate to be approved by regulatory agencies such as Investigational New Drug Application (INDA). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA, which is the most prominent regulatory agency in the world) does not insist on a new drug being marketed as a racemic mixture or as a single enantiomer as long as its safety, efficacy and risk-benefit analyses have been thoroughly carried out by the manufacturer. In view of the huge costs involved in drug development, manufacturers use patent protection as a tool to recover the costs. In most cases, patent extension is also resorted to, but it is a serious issue involving techno-legal issues and competition from generic companies.",2024,Education & Educational Research,0
In the name of TRIPS: The impact of IPR harmonisation on patent activity in Latin America,Patent rights; TRIPS; Latin-America; Developing countries; Multinational corporations; Political economy of IPR; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; DOMESTIC INNOVATION; PROTECTION,"We analyse the effect of country-specific regulatory changes consistent with mandates included in the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement on patenting activities in Latin America (LA) with the aim of contributing to the ongoing debate on patent regimes, innovation and development. TRIPS implied tight negoti-ations between developed and developing countries. By analysing national legislation on IPR in 36 countries, we build a variable that captures when each country exhibits the spirit of TRIPS, which may occur before or after signing TRIPS. We follow two goals: i) to assess whether the impact of changing regulation was different in LA in contrast to developed countries; ii) to analyse specifically the impact on patent activities of residents and non-residents in LA in contrast to developed countries. Our results show that regulatory changes aligned with TRIPS increased patent ac-tivities in LA more than in developed countries, but only by non-residents. This is consistent with the political economy argument stating that the international agenda on intellectual property rights was pushed by large multi-national corporations headquartered in developed countries as part of their globalisation strategies. Our results are also consistent with the economics of innovation literature that suggests that stronger patent regimes only have positive effects on innovation after some national income threshold is attained.",2023,Business & Economics,0

The present study investigates the choice of government's regulation strategy, leading firms' innovation protection strategy and following firms' imitation strategy from the perspective of group evolutionary game. Based on the cost-benefit perspective, an asymmetric tripartite evolutionary game model and a simulation model are constructed to analyze the strategies and stability of the evolutionary equilibrium of each subject. We focus mainly on the protection intensity of innovation achievements by leading enterprises and the difficulty of imitation and substitution by following enterprises. The cost of patent operation and maintenance, government subsidies, and the relative difficulty of technology substitution and imitation were identified as the key factors affecting the evolutionary equilibrium of the system. Based on different scenarios resulting from the aforementioned factors, four equilibrium states are observed in the system, namely {no government regulation, technology secrecy, substitution}, {no government regulation, technology secrecy, imitation}, {no government regulation, patent application, imitation}, and {government regulation, patent application, imitation}. Finally, the study suggests corresponding recommendations for the three parties, which can help governments as well as the leading and following firms to choose appropriate behavioral strategies.

Reimagining Pharmaceutical Market Exclusivities: Should the Duration of Guaranteed Monopoly Periods Be Value Based?,data exclusivities; drug pricing; healthcare reform; health law; health spending; health technology assessment; patents; pharmaceutical policy; PATENTS; DRUGS,"Objectives: To describe the main features of a pharmaceutical market in which the duration of guaranteed monopoly periods would correspond to a new pharmaceutical product's value. Methods: After reviewing patent and regulatory exclusivity-based mechanisms for protecting prescription drug markets from competition to incentivize drug innovation in developed countries, we model market protection mechanisms within the current framework to give the longest-lasting market protections to drug developers that bring the most affordable products to market with highest public health and clinical value. Results: An approach tying pharmaceutical market exclusivity to value would have 3 main features. First, it would be based on regulatory exclusivity (ie, the drug regulator refrains from authorizing generic entry for a certain amount of time), rather than patents. Second, the duration of exclusivity period would be pegged to the magnitude of a product's anticipated health impact and its proposed price by using modified methods from the field of health technology assessment. Third, the duration of the value-based exclusivity period would be reassessed routinely 3 years after the product's launch to account for its realworld effectiveness. Conclusions: Linking a drug's proposed price to the duration of its regulatory-based exclusivities would both incentivize the development of high impact, low-cost products and motivate drug developers to introduce these products at lower prices.",2021,Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,0

The current study analyzes the internal mechanism of investment in environmental protection, green innovation, and solid waste governance capacity. From 2011 to 2018, panel data for 30 provincial units in China were collected. The spatial econometric model and threshold regression model were used to approach study objectives. The results found that green innovation has a significant role in promoting solid waste governance capacity and the spatial spillover effect is obvious. In particular, green invention patent has a core stimulating effect; investment in environmental protection positively moderates the relationship between green innovation and solid waste governance capacity, and the main direction is green utility model patent. However, the spatial spillover effect is not obvious. Moreover, the moderating effect has obvious spatial heterogeneity, especially in the Eastern region. Further analysis showed that there is a single threshold effect of green innovation on solid waste governance capacity. When investment in environmental protection reaches the threshold value of 12.40, the effect of green innovation on solid waste governance capacity is further enhanced. The results provide an important theoretical and practical reference value for China to improve the capacity of solid waste governance.",2023,Development Studies; Public Administration,0
Patent-based framework for assisting entrepreneurial firms' R&D partner selection: Leveraging their limited resources and managing the tension between learning and protection,technology-based entrepreneurial firm; R&D partner selection; technology complementarity; unintended knowledge spillover; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES; DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION; OPEN INNOVATION; LOCAL SEARCH; KNOWLEDGE; VENTURES; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS,"One of the critical attributes for successful R&D collaboration with external organizations is finding appropriate partners. When choosing R&D partners, entrepreneurial firms confront challenges on how to leverage their limited resources and manage the tension between learning and protection. Given those challenges, this study suggests a patent-based framework for helping technology-based entrepreneurial firms select R&D partners. Our framework identifies candidate partners with complementary technological capabilities for an entrepreneurial firm and evaluates candidates by considering both the potential of learning and risk from unintended knowledge spillovers. As a case example, the framework is applied to a firm in the IoT industry.",2020,Business & Economics; Engineering,0

The rapid rise in research and development (R&D) activities taking place in offshore locations that only offer weak legal protection for intellectual property provides the ideal context to study this question. Using interview and survey data from captive R&D centers ofmultinational firms in India, we (1) identify five organizational practices that firms use to protect their knowledge from leaking to competitors in offshore locations, (2) considerwhether these practices limit knowledge leakage or limit damage from leaked knowledge, and (3) explore whether they are complements or substitutes.",2020,Business & Economics,0

Through analysis of panel data from 148 countries over 18 years we reveal that, while all countries may in principle appropriate economic benefits from endogenous technological innovation by increasing their level of outward-bound international patenting, the ability of a country to do so may be hampered by the pre-existing level of its economy. We classify countries in to four strategic innovation quadrants-Slow Movers, Traders, Inventors and Cosmopolitans-based on the relative change over time in their competitiveness in international patenting and their per capita wealth. The mix of wealthy countries and less wealthy countries varies greatly between quadrants, with the wealthy countries dominating the Cosmopolitans quadrant and the less wealthy countries dominating the Slow Movers quadrant. We conclude that, for lower income countries to improve their success in appropriating the benefits of reverse innovation, innovators and would-be innovators based in those countries need to develop sophistication and prowess in international patenting strategy and intellectual property management tailored to the unique conditions of each country.",2021,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0

Knowledge stocks represented by trademarks translate into higher entry rates in the absence of a pronounced appropriation strategy of incumbents or when entrants do not directly compete with the trademarking incumbents. Our findings highlight the two-sided effects of trademarks: as an indicator of product novelties as well as a potential expression of strengthened incumbent appropriation strategies.",2022,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration,0

Prior to ratification, compulsory licensing was eliminated from Canada's Patent Act and intellectual property rights (IPRs) were strengthened. Compulsory licensing allows competitors to produce drugs under patent without the consent of the patent holder, challenging drug monopolies and lowering prices, whereas IPRs lengthen patent protections, shielding patent holders from competition and increasing prices. We perform a critical discourse analysis of key provisions in Chapter 17 of NAFTA in light of industry claims that pharmaceutical innovation requires important investments in research and development, justifying high drug prices. We note that since NAFTA, spending in research and development in Canada has decreased and drug prices have increased, becoming a major barrier to equitable access to critically necessary medications. We argue that by modifying the law, the federal government has wronged the Canadian people by discursively appropriating the language of protecting the public good while in practice legitimizing and consolidating private drug development and production, legalizing exorbitant profits, and excluding well-tested publicly financed alternatives. While NAFTA has now been superseded by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, our analysis offers important lessons moving forward.",2020,Health Care Sciences & Services,0
Analysis on the Enterprises' Innovation Quality Based on the Patent Value: A Comparison between Public and Private Enterprises in China,innovation quality; patent return; public enterprise; private enterprise; R&D resource; patent value; PRIVATIZATION; INFRINGEMENT; PROTECTION; OWNERSHIP; RENEWAL,"To investigate Chinese enterprises' innovation quality and examine how it is determined by the enterprise ownership, this paper uses about 73.8 thousand invention patents applied by Chinese enterprises during 1985-2011 in estimating patent return based on the renewal period. We take patent return to be the measurement of innovation quality, and make a comparison between public and private enterprises. We find that the innovation quality of public enterprises is improved after restructuring, but is still lower than that of private enterprises. We may find the causes of the innovation quality differences from the allocation efficiency of R&D resources. Monopolized enterprises own higher innovation quality by monopolizing industry resources, which leads to a low R&D resources allocation efficiency. In comparison, the R&D resources allocation efficiency of public enterprises in the competitive industry is higher than that in monopolized enterprises. R&D resources allocation efficiency is generally inversely proportional to the public owned level, and proportional to the market competition level. This study generates an important policy implication, that is, the social R&D resources allocation efficiency of China would be improved by disposing part of R&D resources monopolized by public research institutes and public enterprises to private enterprises.",2020,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Spillover Effects of Intellectual Property Protection in the Interwar Aircraft Industry,; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; PATENT POOLS; COMPETITION; GROWTH; ENTRY,"Can strengthening intellectual property protection for producers of one good affect innovation in other related goods? To answer this question, we exploit a unique policy experiment in the interwar military aircraft industry. Airframe designs had little intellectual property protection before 1926, but changes passed by Congress in 1926 provided airframe manufacturers with enhanced property rights over new designs. We show that granting property rights to airframe producers increased innovation in airframes, but slowed innovation in aero-engines, a complementary good where there was no change in the availability of intellectual property protection. We propose and test a simple theory that explains these patterns.",2022,Business & Economics,0

Gastronomy and the development of new food products: Technological prospection,Patent; Intellectual property; Industrial property; Prospect study; Innovation; NPD; ,"The search for new practices to meet consumer demand in the food market has become very important in the field of new product development (NPD) within gastronomy. Prospective studies may help understand this issue in the context of intellectual property protection. Therefore, this review aims to analyze the insertion of gastronomy in the development of new food products in the technological context. A total of 921 patent documents were selected from the Espacenet (R) and National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) databases. The primary International Patent Classification codes identified were A23, A61, and A21, with most documents being invention patents focused on the food industry, divided into four groups: (i) new food product development, (ii) processes/techniques aimed at new product development, (iii) development of new machines/devices and objects for the food industry, and (iv) chemical agents development for application in the food industry. 2003 to 2022 was the period with the highest number of patent documents filed. China dominated the international geographic patenting scenario with 130 patents, whereas at the INPI, the number of documents deposited in Brazil was 182. The most outstanding inventors at Espacenet (R) were Zhao Yuncai and Li Na, whereas at INPI, they were Samela Leal Barros and Juliana Minardi Galo. At Espacenet (R), independent depositors stood out (54.8%), while at INPI, the most prominent contributors were teaching/research institutions (45.8%). The results showed increasing patenting trend in the gastronomy field and new food product development, which provides an insight into potential trends in industrial and technological research development in the food sector.",2023,Food Science & Technology,0
Labor Contract Law and inventor mobility: evidence from China,Employment protection; Inventor mobility; Labor Contract Law; China; EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION; DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY; CAPITAL STRUCTURE; PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; FIRMS; NETWORKS; DATABASE; TAXATION,"This paper investigates the causal effect of employment protection on inventor mobility. Taking the enactment of China's Labor Contract Law in 2008 as a quasi-natural experiment, our difference-in-difference estimate utilizes two-dimensional variations: firm ownership (i.e., SOEs vs. non-SOEs) and year (i.e., before and after 2008). Using combined data on patent applications filed at the State Intellectual Property Office of China and listed manufacturing companies over 2004-2012, we find that the law plays a sizeable positive role in reducing the likelihood of inventor mobility. This effect is more pronounced for firms with higher labor intensity, stricter law enforcement, higher innovation dependence, lower R&D team stability, and inventors that work outside the core of R&D networks. Further, we provide consistent evidence for two plausible mechanisms for the positive effect: limiting the ability of employers to unfairly dismiss inventors and substituting low-skilled workers with inventors. In addition, the law causes firms to obtain more high-quality patents and reduces bankruptcy risk. Overall, our findings shed new light on the economic effects of labor protection in a typical emerging market.",2024,Demography; Business & Economics,0

Using the panel data of 30 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities in China from 1998 to 2017, this paper constructs a two-layer logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) model to uncover the factors influencing the variation of the innovation of LC in China's industrial sectors, including the alternative energy production technology (AEPT) and the energy conversation technology (ECT). The results show that China's industrial LC patent applications rapidly increased after 2005 and AEPT patent applications outweighed ECT patent applications all the time with a gradually narrowing gap. Low-carbon degree played the dominant role in promoting the increase in China's industrial LC patent applications, followed by the economic scale, R&D (research and development) efficiency, and R&D share. Economic structure contributed to the increases in LC patent applications in the central and the western regions, while led to the decreases in the eastern region, the northeastern region, and Chinese mainland(1)). Low-carbon degree and economic scale were two main contributors to the growths of both industrial AEPT patent applications and ECT patent applications in Chinese mainland and the four regions. Several policy recommendations are made to further promote industrial innovation in China.",2021,Energy & Fuels,0

Drawing on agency theory, we propose that losing a patent race drives firms to pursue more technological innovation than winning due to managerial concerns. To investigate the mechanism, we hypothesize that the positive impact of a lost race on a firm's innovation is more pronounced when more shareholders hold near-term investment horizons and when a CEO is less protected against the pressure of shareholders. By constructing a unique dataset of simultaneous patent applications, we find evidence consistent with the proposed theory.Managerial SummaryThis study explores the impact of a patent race on the subsequent innovation of leading technology firms. We find that losing firms tend to pursue more innovation after the race, surpassing the winner in terms of innovation. This finding is particularly pronounced when top managers are more pressured by the shareholders. Specifically, we show that the positive effect of a lost race is especially evident in publicly listed companies with a higher ratio of short-term institutional investors and where CEOs have less protection from shareholder pressures in the public market. This research underscores how a setback in a technology competition can act as a catalyst to change innovation dynamics among competitors at the technology frontiers.",2024,Business & Economics,0
How Half-Causation can enlighten the drafting of patent claims,invention; patent claims; Half-Causation; Half-Causation Branching; HalfCausation Encapsulation; philosophy of technological discovery; philosophy of inventions and patents; philosophy of technology; ,"The author's 2019 article 'If You Wish to Invent Then Follow the Half-Causation Method' presented 'Half-Causation', which is a philosophical model for the systemization of the invention process. It consists of five phases of reasoning, each terminating with taking a 'logical branch'. This paper has two objectives. The first (and preliminary) objective is to introduce a readership in patent practices (and theory) to Half-Causation. The second (and primary) objective is to highlight how Half-Causation can be practically useful to patent practitioners (and perhaps ultimately theorists), specifically in terms of enlightening the drafting of patent claims. In order to do this effectively, the reader is presented with a case which they can engage with to see for themselves how Half-Causation can help, step by step. The presented case was the subject of the USPTO's 2019 patent drafting competition. It consists of rather convoluted instructions received from an 'imaginary' client about their 'imaginary' invention. The case is an excellent opportunity to illustrate how Half-Causation as a philosophical model can be practically useful. Two Half-Causation tools are implemented. The first is Half-Causation Branching, which allows the logical mapping of the inventing space, within which the imaginary invention is located. Implementing this tool reveals two alternative nearby inventions, which if left out of the sought patent protection would render any eventually granted patent practically worthless. Following that, Half-Causation Encapsulation comes to the rescue by allowing the encapsulation of the original imaginary invention, plus the two alternative nearby ones, all in a manner that provides the all-important unity of invention On the one hand, patent agents are not supposed to contribute to their client's inventive concept to the extent that they become co-inventors. On the other hand, scientists and engineers are not supposed to dedicate so much time and effort to learning about complex patent laws as to become patent agents. Arguably, each should aim to excel in their discipline. However, a structured dialogue should be considerably helpful to each and to the patent process as a whole. It is proposed that Half-Causation, with its logical structure, can provide a basis for such a dialogue. Besides targeting a readership in patent practices and theory, this paper should be of interest to multiple readerships, for example in engineering design, medical discovery and philosophy of technology.",2021,Government & Law,0

To shift the paradigm from conventional cancer therapeutics to anti-inflammatory nano-therapeutics, thorough understanding of the strategies, progress, success, challenges and future perspectives are needed. The present review highlights all these aspects in addition to innovations patented on them.

When speed matters: a discussion on the benefits of a grace period in patent law to accelerate pharmaceutical innovation in times of pandemic,drug discovery; grace period; invention disclosure; novelty; open innovation; patent law harmonization; ,"The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a solemn reminder of the need to accelerate pharmaceutical innovation. The desire for fast access to vaccines triggered discussion of unrestricted access to research findings with the hope of facilitating the drug discovery process to combat COVID-19. Increasingly, abolition of the patent system is being discussed in connection with the fight against the pandemic. This may accelerate discovery of and increase access to medicines. However, society's desire for immediate disclosure of research findings conflicts with the inventor's legitimate interest to protect his or her invention as well as the need to recover investments made to develop the drug. The call for immediate disclosure of research results contradicts the interest of the inventor, whose primary goal is to secure his intellectual property rights, usually by applying for patent protection. In Europe, where patent law is based on the principle of absolute novelty, disclosure of the results reduces novelty and prevents subsequent patenting. Consequently, patenting remains the top priority for pharmaceutical companies in Europe, while disclosure of the results is secondary. The following article looks critically at the idea of using the grace period in European patent law to reconcile the conflicting interests of society and inventors in times of pandemic. In this paper, we investigate whether the implementation of a grace period in European patent law like that known in the USA, Japan, or Korea benefits the disclosure of results and increases the flow of information, ultimately leading to the promotion of innovation and rapid drug discovery. This article questions whether the use of a grace period provides a sufficient incentive to the inventor for rapid disclosure.",2022,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,0
Pharmaceutical exports and patents in India - a systems approach,India; Pharmaceutical exports; Empirical estimation; Simultaneous equation; Patents; C3; F14; L65; UNIT-ROOT TESTS; SIMULTANEOUS-EQUATIONS; IMPACT; INNOVATION; PROTECTION,"PurposeThe Indian pharmaceutical industry currently faces multiple challenges, including rising costs and slowing export growth, which in turn have limited its ability to expand presence in global canvas. Given the nature of sectoral dynamics, a pharmaceutical firm must undertake huge investments in R&D to introduce product innovation, in turn enhancing market share and sustaining profit streams. The development of novel medicines, confirmed by the granting of patent rights, provides a pharma company edge over its competitors. In addition, presence of innovator firms within the industry invigorates the sectoral value chain and raises efficiency. Hence, it is important to analyze whether granting patent rights enhances the exports of pharmaceutical products in the Indian context.Design/methodology/approachThe current study explored this question using a simultaneous-equation framework. Specifically, the authors use the methods developed by Davidson and MacKinnon (1993) and Greene (2003) to obtain heteroscedasticity-consistent estimates. The time-series properties of the data were further probed, and robust estimates were used to test the theory. Methods developed by Baltagi (1981) have been used further to refine the authors' estimations.FindingsAfter controlling for relevant variables, it is observed that granting of patents caused a significantly positive impact on pharmaceutical exports. Furthermore, the change in the patent administration regime had a significant impact on patent fillings, which further impacted their exportability. Compared to patents granted patents filed had a higher impact on pharmaceutical exports.Originality/valueThis study attempts to apply the framework developed by Goldstein and Khan (1978) with necessary modifications to suit the context of a developing country. The application of the 3SLS method to estimate the export supply equation for pharmaceutical products is a novel approach to the research question in general and to the Indian context in particular.

How public investment fuels innovation: Clues from government-subsidized USPTO patents,Technological innovation; Patent analysis; Government-subsidized patent; Government policy; Government-subsidized innovation; INTERDISCIPLINARITY; DIVERSITY; DETERMINANTS; PORTFOLIO,"Considerably little effort has been devoted to systematically exploring the landscape of government-funded innovation schemes, leaving policymakers and academics little empirical ev-idence with which to grasp the overall situation of national R&D funding strategies. In the United States (US), patents with a government right or financial interest are flagged, offering a window through which we can examine the landscape of today's patterns of government support for inno-vation. We conduct the examination from the perspectives of the leading government agencies, the promotor-recipient relationship, and the common concerns of different participants. The re-sults show that the R&D project funding by federal agencies has, among other factors, contributed to the growth in the number of patent records. The Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DoE), and Health and Human Services (HHS), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have issued the most funding and hold rights to more patent records than any other agencies. Moreover, re-forms to the US patent system made 40 years ago to afford more protection to non-government assignees appear to have significantly impacted patenting activity. Universities, companies, and individuals have become far more active in fulfilling government-funded projects, with remark-able innovations as a result. In recent years, funding priorities have shifted toward research in biomedicine, fields related to human life, and computer science. However, the four dominant agencies responsible for most government funding differ in their investment priorities and fre-quently adjust which areas of innovation they support. This study is among the first attempts to support the landscape of the public-invested innovation using the full government-subsidized patent dataset. The analyses in this paper are instructive in understanding the dynamics of US government funding for innovation and informing effective policymaking around innovation.",2022,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,0

We capture information transparency with both textual and numerical information disclosed in 10-Ks. Using patent citations to proxy for investment in follow-on innovation, we predict and find a positive association between transparency at the knowledge source and follow-on innovation. We further show that the effect of information transparency varies with the degree of uncertainty around technological innovation. Thus, the evidence suggests that information transparency facilitates investment in follow-on innovation by resolving uncertainty associated with investment in technological innovation. An analysis using the cited firms' going-private decision as a negative shock to information transparency confirms the significant effect of a cited firm's disclosure on its decision to invest in follow-on innovation. Our study contributes to the literature on the positive externalities of peer-firm disclosures and highlights the important role of information transparency in shaping innovation investment decisions.",2023,Business & Economics,0

Little is however known about the potential impact of the strength of patent systems (IPRs) and renewable consumption. This study addresses this issue using a GNTNT methodological framework for a panel of 47 developed and developing economies over the period 1998-2017. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study where two alternative indices that measure differences in strength of patent systems are employed to explore the underlying rela-tionship whilst at the same time controlling for other potential determinants of renewable energy consumption. We find that protection of intellectual property rights across nearly all estimated models and country groups tends to have a negative impact on renewable energy consumption whilst a convex relationship is established when nonlinearities are explored. Finally, the global financial crisis is found to have a negative impact on renewable energy in both developed and developing economies. Further probing indicates that in a depressed economic environment the strength of IPRs might have a significant role to play in encouraging more renewable energy consumption.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,0
Invention and Global Diffusion of Technologies for Climate Change Adaptation: A Patent Analysis,O30; Q54; Q55; INNOVATIVE RESPONSES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; PRODUCTIVITY; IMPACTS; MORTALITY; QUALITY; GROWTH; POOR,"In addition to greenhouse gas mitigation efforts, the global economy will need adaptation technology to function in a changing climate. In this article, we use patent data to describe the global pace of innovation in climate adaptation technology. We identify the leading countries, track technology diffusion across borders, and relate innovation trends to adaptation needs. We find that innovation in adaptation technology has developed less rapidly than innovation in low-carbon technologies since 2005. This seems mainly due to the fact that adaptation is more important in sectors where the overall pace of innovation is slower than average, such as agriculture. Moreover, innovation is highly concentrated, with China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United States accounting for nearly two-thirds of global patented inventions that are relevant to climate adaptation. Other economies could benefit through international technology transfer, but we find only limited technology diffusion through the patent system. International diffusion is particularly low in agriculture and flood protection, and there is virtually no transfer of the relevant patented knowledge to low-income countries. As a result, we find a striking mismatch between countries' adaptation needs and technological availability.",2023,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Optimising Intellectual Property in the Age of AI Creativity: Perspectives from the United States,; ,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a subject of, and contributor to, innovation across industries. These AI-related inventions raise important intellectual property (IP) law issues, most notably under copyright and patent law. Copyright law must grapple with the issue of AI as author and patent law faces the issue of AI as inventor. AI also raises novel challenges for patent law's subject matter eligibility, non-obviousness and disclosure requirements. Additionally, AI implementers and other data owners should consider how IP can protect data - the fundamental ingredient of all AI systems.

In this context, eco-innovation has become increasingly important. Nevertheless, countries are heterogeneous in terms of their eco-innovation production. Our study contributes to the understanding of the drivers of eco-innovation by analyzing the determinants of green patent production at the country level. We focus on the specific characteristics of green innovations, namely their complexity and appropriability problem, and explain how these characteristics affect firms' incentives to produce green in-novations. We then select three external dimensions related to these characteristics and examine how they affect the number of green patents produced. These three dimensions are economic complexity, protection of property rights, and effectiveness of the judicial system. Using the Furman et al. (2001) model as a starting point, this study focuses on green patent production in OECD countries for the period 2007-2016. The results show that economic complexity and intellectual property rights are key determinants of green patent production.",2023,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,0
NIH funding for patents that contribute to market exclusivity of drugs approved 2010-2019 and the public interest protections of Bayh-Dole,; SCIENCE; INNOVATION; DISCOVERY; KNOWLEDGE; US,"Previous studies have shown that National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding contributed >$187 billion for basic or applied research related to the 356 drugs approved 2010-2019. This analysis asks how much of this funding led to patents cited as providing market exclusivity, patents that would be subject to the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act that promote and protect the public interest. The method involves identifying published research in PubMed related to the approved drugs (applied research) or their targets (basic research). NIH-funded projects (grants) funding these publications and patents arising from these projects were both identified in RePORT. Patents cited as providing market exclusivity were identified in DrugPatentWatch (which incorporates FDA Orange Book). NIH funded basic or applied research related to all 313 FDA-approved drugs 2010-2019 with at least one patent in DrugPatentWatch. This research comprised 350 thousand publications (9% applied research; 91% basic research) supported by 341 thousand fiscal years (project years) of NIH funding and $164 billion in NIH project year costs (17% applied research; 83% basic research). These NIH projects also produced 22,360 patents, 119 of which were cited in DrugPatentWatch as protecting 34/313 drugs. These patents were associated with 769 project years of NIH funding (0.23% total) and project year costs of $0.95 billion (0.59% total). Overall, only 1.5% of total NIH funding for applied research and 0.38% of total NIH funding for basic research was associated with patents in DrugPatentWatch. This analysis shows that very little of the NIH funding for research that contributes to new drug approvals leads to patents that provide market exclusivity and are subject to the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act that promote the public interest in practical applications of the research, reasonable use and pricing, and a return on this public sector investment. This suggests that the Bayh-Dole Act is limited in its ability to protect the public interest in the pharmaceutical innovations driven by NIH-funded research.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
"Patents And Regulatory Exclusivities On Inhalers For Asthma And COPD, 1986-2020",; NONADHERENCE; DISEASE; TRENDS,"Inhalers are the mainstay of treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These products face limited generic competition in the US and remain expensive. To better understand the strategies that brand-name inhaler manufacturers have employed to preserve their market dominance, we analyzed all patents and regulatory exclusivities granted to inhalers approved by the Food and Drug Administration between 1986 and 2020. Of the sixty-two inhalers approved, fifty-three were brand-name products, and these brand-name products had a median of sixteen years of protection from generic competition. Only one inhaler contained an ingredient with a new mechanism of action. More than half of all patents were on the inhaler devices, not the active ingredients or other aspects of these drug-device combinations. Manufacturers augmented periods of brand-name market exclusivity by moving active ingredients from one inhaler device into another (device hops). The median time from approval of an originator product to the last-to-expire patent or regulatory exclusivity of branded follow-ons was twenty-eight years (across device hops on fourteen originator products). Regulatory and patent reform is critical to ensure that the rewards bestowed on brand-name inhaler manufacturers better reflect the added clinical benefit of new products.",2022,Health Care Sciences & Services,0

Based on a comprehensive firm-level panel dataset of patents filed by companies from 43 countries over 1995-2015, we find that compared with firms in low-trust countries, firms in high-trust countries have higher innovation output as measured by number of patents and patent forward citations. We also find that greater trust is associated with i) higher levels of innovation investment, ii) less volatile innovation investment over time, and iii) weaker relation between innovation investment and internally generated cash flow. Finally, we document that greater trust is associated with higher market valuation of innovation investment and more efficient conversion of innovation investment into future sales. Overall, our firm-level evidence indicates that greater social trust improves corporate innovation and its outcomes.",2023,Business & Economics,0

The fate of Unaipon's much celebrated 1909 shearing patent is fully explored. Exploitation of this invention is contextualised with reference to the patent activities of one of the most successful twentieth-century agricultural conglomerates that sold shearing handpieces, Cooper Engineering Ltd (Aust). Unaipon's claim he was ripped off is considered in light of the demands made on him by the Chief Protector, politicians, religious groups, museum staff, and harassment by mission superintendents and police.

Whereas various causes and effects of technological change have been examined, empirical investigations of the efficiency involved in innovation production are relatively few. Using data on a large sample of nations over 2018-2020 and considering corruption, regulatory quality, and state fragility as alternative institutional dimensions, our results show that greater corruption facilitates (greases) efficiency in the production of innovations. This is also the case with improvements in regulatory quality, while greater state fragility increases inefficiency. These findings for the overall sample are somewhat different for the OECD and non-OECD subsamples, although the greasing effect of corruption remains throughout.

COORDINATION OF TRADE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS POLICIES,Intellectual property rights; tariff; R&D spillover; entry mode; DEVELOPMENT SPILLOVERS; PATENT PROTECTION; SOUTHERN INNOVATION; TECHNOLOGY; MARKET; COUNTRIES; WELFARE; FDI,We employ a bilateral R&D spillover model to analyze how a domestic government coordinates its intellectual property rights (IPR) and trade policies and hence affects a foreign firm's choice between export (EX) and foreign direct investment (FDI). We find that both firms' profits increase with IPR protection if the IPR protection level in the domestic country is loose. The domestic country can coordinate trade and IPR policies and reach a high welfare level by affecting foreign firm's entry decisions. The profitability and desirability may decrease with the strength of IPR protection and correspond to a welfare-reducing R&D.,2023,Business & Economics,0

In this study, we address how to improve the measurement of innovations and their impact on a country's competitiveness and economic growth. We provide an overview of indicators used to measure innovations and propose three new ones that are supposed to capture knowledge spillover: The Foreign Knowledge Inflow, Domestic Knowledge Outflow, and General Propensity to Patent. Innovation was proxied by the number of patent applications, which we supplemented with indexes measuring the origin of knowledge and its transfer. We employed the system GMM method on panel data of 56 countries for 2002-2019 to confirm and compare the informational value of standard innovation indicators and our indexes. Implementation of indexes revealed the counteracting impact of patenting on economic growth when the positive effect of innovation creation is weakened by knowledge disclosure. We provide evidence that a low propensity to patent facilitates growth. The impact of foreign knowledge on an economy is dependent on its technological capacity. The infusion of foreign knowledge boosts the growth of fast-growing economies but inhibits the growth of less technologically sophisticated ones. This supports our assumption that when researching the impact of innovations on economic growth, it is crucial to consider additional factors. Hence, index implementation appears to be the correct method.",2022,Business & Economics,0

Crantz is an oilseed relict crop. This article recognizes camelina's current and potential future uses based on a comprehensive scientific and patent document analysis. The annual number of literature on camelina increased significantly; in the case of patent documents, this increase is most evident after 2009 and in the case of scientific publications - after 2010. We identified six main thematic groups among 1039 scientific papers analyzed: cultivation, genetics, biological characteristics, livestock feeding, energetic use, and oil extraction technology. We also showed the links between these groups. There are seven vital patent applications among 2307, which meet two conditions: they are highly cited in other patent documents and submitted for protection in many global patent jurisdictions. The current scientific research on the use of camelina focuses on: animal feed, human foodstuff, industrial chemical raw materials (glycerin, polymers, ethanol, lignin), fuels (diesel, jet fuel, biogas, energy pellet, pyrolysis oil), and compost to improve soil. The results of the analysis of scientific and patent documents point to potential future applications of camelina: as a pioneer crop in reclaimed areas, as a cover or companion crop in agriculture, and as a source for new chemical additives (to pesticides, coatings, glue, and filaments in 3D printing technology), as meat analogs, as a feedstock in construction and packaging materials production, as a source of biochar and as straw water filters.",2022,Agriculture,0

New Indicators of the Technological Impact of Scientific Production,Technological Impact; Patents; Scientometric; PATSTAT; Scopus; SCOPUS; LINKAGE; SCIENCE,"Purpose: Building upon pioneering work by Francis Narin and others, a new methodological approach to assessing the technological impact of scientific research is presented. Design/methodology/approach: It is based on the analysis of citations made in patent families included in the PATSTAT database that is to scientific papers indexed in Scopus. Findings: An advanced citation matching procedure is applied to the data in order to construct two indicators of technological impact: on the citing (patent) side, the country/region in which protection is sought and a patent family's propensity to cite scientific papers are taken into account, and on the cited (paper) side, a relative citation rate is defined for patent citations to papers that is similar to the scientific paper-to-paper citation rate in classical bibliometrics. Research limitations: The results are limited by the available data, in our case Scopus and PATSTAT, and especially by the lack of standardization of references in patents. This required a matching procedure that is neither trivial nor exact. Practical implications: Results at the country/region, document type, and publication age levels are presented. The country/region-level results in particular reveal features that have remained hidden in analyses of straight counts. Especially notable is that the rankings of some Asian countries/regions move upwards when the proposed normalized indicator of technological impact is applied as against the case with straight counts of patent citations to those countries/regions' published papers. Originality/value: In our opinion, the level of sophistication of the indicators proposed in the current paper is unparalleled in the scientific literature, and provides a solid basis for the assessment of the technological impact of scientific research in countries/regions and institutions.",2021,Information Science & Library Science,0

Using knowledge production model, this study examines the role of human capital in influencing Nigerian MS firms' propensity to innovate. The study applies binary probit regression model to World Bank's merged 2014 business enterprise and follow-up innovation surveys for Nigeria. The overall results reveal that human capital significantly drives the chances of the firms to innovate in Nigeria. Specifically, top manager with postgraduate education has significant and positive effect on the firms' probability to protect all statutory intellectual properties. Similarly, the number of skilled workers significantly and positively determines the chances of the firms to apply for patent and utility model. Reward to production staff based on performance significantly encourages the firms to apply for patent, trademarks and copyright. Investing in Research and Development (R&D) activity also encourages the firms to apply for only patent. Government support is also found to be of importance in driving the chances of the firms to apply for patent and trademark. Whereas skilled labour and reward to production staff are more important to manufacturing firms' patent application, government support is more essential to service firms' patent application. The firms' probability to use each strategy to intellectual property protection is complementary to the most related strategy. The policy implications of the study suggest that much attention should be directed to the significant factors in formulating innovation-based human capital policy.",2021,Business & Economics,0

Why patent waiver for Covid-19 vaccines and pharmaceuticals?,access; Covid-19; medicines; patent waiver; TRIPS; vaccines; ,"Patent protection emerged as one of the most challenging barriers to the access to medicines, medical equipment, and vaccines as well for the treatment and containment of Covid-19 when it became a pandemic. The severe scarcity of vaccines and pharmaceutical products were weakening the fight against Covid-19, and endeavor to contain the recurrence of pandemic waves while mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 was also on the full swing. Therefore, India and South Africa jointly proposed for patent waiver at WTO in October 2020 to effectively deal with the short-supply of medicines, medical equipment, vaccines and high price concern related to these products. After 20 months of consultation and negotiations with major stakeholders, the WTO came up with decision on patent waiver in 12th Ministerial Conference (12th MC). The time taken to reach to the decision in the pandemic situation and the narrow scope of the decision is a serious concern for the entire world to deal effectively with Covid-19 and its variants. This paper attempts to analyse the patent waiver in the context of the agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). It discusses patent barriers, alternative measures and needs for equitable access to vaccines and pharmaceuticals amidst the pandemic. Paper applies the qualitative methodology of research mainly content analysis method in the framework of contextualisation, decontextualisation, and recontextualisation. Results show that suspending certain provisions of the TRIPS required for the production of vaccines and medicines would prove a crucial tool for economies to return to its pre-Covid-19 era.

Indication-Specific Generic Uptake of Imatinib Demonstrates the Impact of Skinny Labeling,; UNITED-STATES; INHIBITORS; ADHERENCE,"PURPOSE Generic competition can be delayed if brand-name manufacturers obtain additional patents on supplemental uses. The US Food and Drug Administration allows generic drug manufacturers to market versions with skinny labels that exclude patent-protected indications. This study assessed whether use of generic versions of imatinib varied between indications included and excluded from the skinny labels. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we identified adult patients covered by commercial insurance or Medicare Advantage plans who initiated imatinib from February 2016 (first generic availability) to September 2020. Generic versions were introduced with skinny labels that included indications covering treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) but excluded treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) because of remaining patent protections. Logistic regression was used to determine whether use of generic versus brand-name imatinib differed between patients with a diagnosis of CML or GIST, adjusting for demographics, insurance type, prior use of brand-name drugs, and calendar month. RESULTS Among 2,000 initiators, 934 (47%) had CML and 686 (34%) had GIST. Within 3 years after generics entered the market, more than 90% of initiators in both groups used generic imatinib. Initiation of generic imatinib was slightly lower among patients with GIST than among patients with CML (85% v 88%; adjusted odds ratio 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.80; P <= .001). CONCLUSION Generic versions of imatinib were dispensed frequently for indications both included (CML) and excluded (GIST) from the skinny labeling, although patients with GIST were slightly less likely to receive a generic version. The skinny labeling pathway allowed generics to enter the market before patent protection for treating patients with GIST expired, facilitating lower drug prices.

This study introduces a new interaction term by combining trademarks and eco-patents and examining the role of environmental policy, energy consumption, environmental taxes, urbanization, and economic growth on the environment. The panel effect is tested using the Nonlinear ARDL and OLS methods, whereas country-specific results are estimated using the Granger causality approach. The outcomes reveal that trademarks and eco-patents decrease carbon dioxide emission; however, energy consumption, urbanization and economic growth are the main polluters in both regions. Environmental policies and taxes have a significant impact on the western region's mitigation efforts, while insignificant evidence is found for the southern region. Unidirectional and bidirectional causal relationships are observed among the variables; still, the outcomes are country-specific.

Are IPRs and Patents the Real Barriers to COVID-19 Vaccine Supplies?,; INNOVATION; AFRICA,"In less than a year since the WHO's declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, 13 vaccines against COVID-19 have been approved in at least one jurisdiction. However, new challenges have arisen, mostly surrounding the global distribution and access to these vaccines, particularly for low and middle-income countries. The Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), mainly patents, have been accused of standing in the way of global vaccination supplies. By adopting an evidence-based approach, this paper challenges such current (mis)belief, arguing that the roadblocks of the inoculation program have nothing to do with IPRs but the real bottlenecks instead lie in manufacturing capacity, supply chain and export restrictions issues. The idea that vaccines will be made cheaper and quicker by removing the patent system and other forms of IPRs is both erroneous and unfounded. The authors further argue that eroding patent protection does more harm than good. Firstly, it will disincentivise research and development (R&D) in the vaccine industry, one of the most challenging sectors. Secondly, if patented vaccines are in the public domain and are not properly allocated, the ripple effect of the tragedy of common goods will soon be felt. Finally, removing IP rules can cause an increase in counterfeit products. Therefore, less time should be spent on trying to dismantle the patent system. Instead, the focus should be on addressing trade restrictions, improving the global manufacturing partnerships between vaccine developers, and strengthening their cross-border supply chains to re-unite a fragmented world.",2021,Business & Economics; Government & Law,0
Patent Philanthropy,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; SOUTH-AFRICA; ACCESS; MEDICINES; HEALTH; POLICY; INNOVATION; PRICE; LAW,"As in previous global public health crises, such as the HIV epidemic, patents have presented a major obstacle to vaccine supply amid the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. Compulsory licensing and intellectual property waiver have been put forth as solutions. However, as this Article and other studies reveal, neither proposal alone can address global vaccine inequality with sufficient urgency. Nor would these measures significantly improve the capacity of developing countries to produce medicines and vaccines. This Article proposes the establishment of a Patent Philanthropy Initiative (PPI) to overcome the inadequacies of compulsory licensing and intellectual property waiver and equip the global community with better preparedness for future public health crises. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would be called upon to administer the PPI. Pharmaceutical companies owning USPTO-granted medical patents would be required to contribute 1% of their annual post-tax profits accrued from their patented medicines to the PPI. Such financial contributions would then be deployed by pharmaceutical companies to promote public health in the United States and abroad through transferring knowledge, donating medical products, constructing facilities, training professionals, and facilitating public health education. This Article defends the validity of the PPI against concerns that it would violate the TRIPS Agreement and the U.S. Constitution and discourage investment in medical innovation. It illustrates the PPI's economic and social functions in improving the capacity of developing countries to produce pharmaceuticals, and its ethical function in prompting pharmaceutical companies to accept greater responsibility for the protection of public health. These functions are discussed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",2022,International Relations; Government & Law,0
To Waive or not to Waive: International Patent Protection and the Covid-19 Pandemic,Covid-19 vaccine access; international intellectual property regime; TRIPS agreement; access to medicine; intellectual property waiver; compulsory licensing; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,"In 2020, South Africa and India submitted a landmark proposal to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to allow all countries the legal right under international trade rules to choose not to grant or enforce patents and other intellectual property (IP) related to COVID-19 drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and other technologies and materials for the duration of the pandemic. Since then, the proposal for an IP waiver has gained support from 100 WTO members. However, a small number have continued to oppose implementing an IP waiver, maintaining that the current flexibilities under the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) provide a sufficient remedy. The TRIPS flexibility most recommended by waiver opponents is the Compulsory Licensing mechanism which allows government the authority to grant permission to itself or domestic producers to make a patented product without the patent owners' consent. This article conducts a comparative analysis of the potential IP waiver and the compulsory licensing mechanism's functioning in relation to facilitating increased production of Covid-19 vaccines by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers.",2022,Government & Law,0

Differently from previous studies, we argue that open innovation fosters firm's patenting activity. Design/methodology/approach We use linear regression analysis to test model's hypotheses. Data are drawn from the Eurostat statistics and refer to a large sample of European firms (NACE Rev.2). Findings The findings confirm that open innovation fosters patenting activity in health care, also thanks to huge governments' expenditures in this market. Research limitations/implications The study focuses solely on European firms and it adopts a traditional linear approach. So, we cannot exclude that different dynamics may occur across European borders. Future research should address this concern by focusing on multi-country comparative studies. Practical implications Open innovation is the most suitable model for health industry, because it improves both innovation performance and intellectual capital of firms. Originality/value The study tackles an existing gap of the literature by considering how the presence of large customers impacts the strength of intellectual property protection.",2021,Business & Economics,0
How Fair is Patent Litigation in China? Evidence from the Beijing Courts,intellectual property protection; patent litigation; Beijing courts; inadequate enforcement; trade war; discrimination; damage; LAW,"By conducting field research and analysing judgments delivered in Beijing courts from 2004 to 2011, we find that the popular notion held by China's trade partners of the inadequacy of intellectual property protection is only partly supported by the empirical evidence. The likelihood of winning lawsuits is higher for foreign than domestic plaintiffs and the extremely low damages ruled by Chinese courts are due to particular causes. Courts lack consistent methods to calculate incurred losses in intellectual property right (IPR) infringements and consequently routinely apply the statutory damages whose upper limit is restricted by legislation. Efforts by Chinese legislators to enhance compensation by lifting the upper limit of awardable statutory damages in the Third Amendment of Chinese Patent Law (2008) did not seem to have an effect on our sample. Chinese policymakers should instead focus on the cause of the issue by providing more implementable guidelines for courts to calculate losses. Courts need to develop applicable conventions for calculating damages, based on objective criteria of how much compensation ought to be payable, which is also the basis of calculating reasonable statutory damages. Thus, the new provision of the right of information on pirated goods proposed by the ongoing Fourth Amendment provides a significant weapon to combat counterfeiting.",2020,Area Studies,0

For analysis, novel econometric approaches include nonlinear ARDL and Fourier ARDL, and for robustness, dynamic OLS applied. The results from cointegration tests reveal that there exists a significant long-run relationship between CCO2E, globalization, economic growth, patents, and the carbon intensity of GDP. Additionally, the empirical results indicate that only positive shock in patents on environmental innovations have a negative and significant impact on CCO2E, while positive and negative shocks in GDP and carbon intensity of GDP significantly increase CCO2E. However, only a negative shock in globalization demonstrates the increase in CCO2E. Also, dynamic OLS findings confirmed the robustness. Given the outcome, it is recommended that the Danish government be cautious when approving policies intended to increase economic growth, as this could negatively affect environmental sustainability. More so, research and development must contribute to technological advancement in the Danish manufacturing sector. Despite this, it is important to prioritize patent promotion. Patent protection can enable Denmark to develop eco-friendly technologies that can reduce carbon emissions, thus enabling life to be more sustainable by utilizing fewer resources and energy. Denmark can reduce CO2E and foster economic development through a strong patent system on environmental technologies.",2023,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Supplementary protection of intellectual property rights for medicines,; COMPETITION,"Volynets I.P., Dorozhko G.K., Petrenko V.O., Belitsky V.V. The article discusses the issue of extending the legal protection of intellectual property rights for medicines. The research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the problems related to the implementation of Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) in national legislation and possible solutions. The study also seeks to draw conclusions and make proposals for improving the regulatory framework for the SPCs of medicines. The work utilizes general scientific and specialized methods of scientific cognition, including dialectical, formal-logical, systemic structural, comparative legal, as well as modeling, analysis, and synthesis methods, which collectively contributed to the organization, planning, and conduct of the research. The study is based on scientific publications from databases and search systems (PubMed, JAMA, Scopus, Springer, BMC, Oxford Academic), international and national regulatory acts, statistical studies by international organizations (Precedence Research), patents for inventions related to medicines, recommendations by national government bodies, as well as prescriptions and guidelines from international and national experts. Considering the analysis of statistical data on the development and implementation of medicines, it has been determined that original biological medicines are a major factor in the rising prices of treating conditions such as diabetes, oncological diseases, and others. Examples of patents for medicines owned by global pharmaceutical companies (Gilead, Bayer Intellectual Property Gmbh, etc.) that have ensured their commercial success and competitive advantages are examined. It has been established that patent protection provides the right holder with the opportunity to maintain a monopoly in the market, thereby compensating for the time spent on the development and research of original medicinal products. Legislative approaches to regulating relationships concerning the supplementary protection of inventions related to medicines in the form of SPCs in Ukraine and the EU are identified. The exclusivity periods for regulatory data protection for medicines in the EU are outlined. Based on the conducted research, it is concluded that the application of the SPC mechanism is a tool to achieve a balance between the protection of intellectual property rights and access to original medicines. Timely entry of generics and biosimilars to the market contributes to reducing market prices but negatively impacts the profitability of manufacturers of original medicines. Attention is drawn to problematic aspects of the legislative implementation of the SPC mechanism in Ukraine, which leads to incorrect interpretation and implementation of relevant provisions and necessitates updating. In light of the aforementioned, there is an urgent need in Ukraine to implement, update, and improve the legislative mechanism for regulating SPCs.",2023,General & Internal Medicine,0

We find that a suitable IPR protection system that matches the phase of economic and technological development a country has reached is the key for developing countries to upgrade their status in GVC, which are dominated by multinational firms from developed countries. Empirical analysis with multinational panel data for 55 countries from 2005 to 2015 provides evidence in support of the predictions of this model, although the GVC-enhancing effects of IPR protection are heterogeneous for developing and developed countries. The empirical conclusions are robust after using the instrumental variable method and controlling for endogeneity.",2020,Business & Economics,0

The study was carried out in 26 countries of the OECD from 2010-2019 using the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) model and data from Eurostat and OECD datasets. Indicators for the independent variables were non-market-based stringency, market-based subsidy, gross domestic expenditure on R&D by source of funds, R&D expenditure intramural, national expenditure on environmental protection environmental protection, environmentally related patents with co-inventors, and employees involved in education and training. The results revealed that a significant effect of government stringency in the form of non-market-based stringency, environmental innovation, government financing on R&D, and national expenditure on environmental protection have significant impact on the attainment of circular economy within OECD countries. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the market-based subsidy on domestic material consumption (dmc). We conclude that a blend of government policies is the effective means of achieving a circular economy.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

We study the relationship between 362 firms with dual-class shares and their innovativeness using patent citations from Google Patents over the 1976 through 2006 period. We find dual-class shares have significant innovation effect in high-tech sectors, hard-to-innovate industries, firms with higher external takeover threat and firms heavily dependent on external equity financing. We also document a positive causality relationship between dual-class structures and the quality of innovation. The channel for this causal relationship is the protection mechanism by which managers can take a long-term view. From a policy perspective, regulators should promote a corporate governance system that protects corporate long-term interest for shareholders.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Are anti-dumping investigations against China ineffective in curbing innovation? Evidence from firms' patent filings,Anti-dumping investigation; innovation; trade diversion effect; firm performance; patent filing; TRADE; COMPETITION; PROTECTION; DUTIES; PRODUCTIVITY; RESPONSES; GROWTH,"This paper empirically investigates the effect of anti-dumping investigations on export firm innovation performance using Chinese firm-level patent filings data and anti-dumping case from 2000 to 2013. By employing the staggered difference-in-differences strategy, our empirical evidence shows that anti-dumping investigations imposed on firms lead to an improvement in innovation rather than suppression. Further examination identifies that the trade diversion effect is a crucial mechanism through which anti-dumping investigations affect firm innovation. We find that firms are experiencing a significant increase in exports of investigated products to non-involved countries, while also expanding their export destinations and diversifying the range of exported products. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that anti-dumping charges significantly promote innovation in high-productivity firms and multi-product exporting enterprises, while financial constraints are identified as a crucial factor restricting innovation.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Fire Rings,Artistic design; Individuality; Copyright protection; Infringement; Works of applied art; Intellectual creations; Individual character; Unfair competition; Priority of use; ,"1. It cannot be generally concluded that a minimalist design or a reduction to the essential establishes necessary individuality. What is decisive is that the work clearly stands out artistically in its overall impression from the then known set of forms for the product in question (here: barbecue devices), i.e. whether the artistic design within the scope of its purpose is so clearly distinguishable from the previously known forms that it appears to be unique or original.2. The fact that technical requirements do not play a role in copyright law is not true. However, there is a difference between compliance with the patent requirements and the question of whether the patent specifies a particular design.3. The scope of protection for a utility object is all the smaller, the less pronounced the individual character conferred on the work by the exploitation of the creative scope.4. Only a party whose sign has been in use for a longer period of time can invoke the unfair competition law protection of Art. 3(1)(d) Act against Unfair Competition. The decisive factor is an earlier proven, outwardly perceptible use in business transactions; the mere intention to use the sign is not sufficient.",2024,Government & Law,0

In a setup where firms have asymmetric profit convexity, which we relate to firm quality, we show that this has interesting effects on valuation and the order of entry. The interplay between profit convexity and market growth impacts whether a high-quality or a low-quality firm is the first mover. We relate the first-mover advantage to patents; we find that patents expedite investments and increase the incentives for high-quality firms to become first movers. Furthermore, even with a persistent first-mover advantage we show that first-mover advantages in terms of firm value are either over- or underestimated. Thus, our model sheds light on why empirical studies find mixed support for the existence of a first-mover advantage.",2020,Business & Economics,0
Mandatory Environmental Regulation and Green Technology Innovation: Evidence from China,mandatory environmental regulations; environmental protection; green technology innovation; green patent; sustainable development; DIFFUSION; JAPAN; US,"Faced with the severe situation of high energy consumption and major pollutant emissions, the Chinese government has adopted various mandatory environmental regulations (MERs) to improve the binding force of environmental protection policy implementation. In 2006, the environmental protection target responsibility system was implemented, and the energy conservation and emission reduction targets were linked to the performance assessment of government officials as a binding indicator. What is the impact of this policy on green technology innovation activities? Based on this, this paper identifies the relevant indicators of green technology innovation activities. It uses the difference-in-differences (DID) method to investigate the impact of mandatory environmental regulation on the quantity and quality of green technology innovation activities. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The implementation of MERs promoted the expansion of the number of green patent applications. (2) MERs also led to the decline of the quality and the emergence of the foaming phenomenon. (3) Enterprises with weak innovation ability are the main group causing the decline of green technology innovation quality, and they are concentrated in independent innovation and low-level pollution industries. The conclusion of this paper helps provide a theoretical basis and countermeasures for deepening the reform of the MER policy, strengthening the coordination of different environmental regulation tools, and establishing a market-oriented green technology innovation system and environmental protection science and technology policy.",2022,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0

Using these contributions in seed production and further development without prior informed consent (PIC) threatens the sustainability of varietal improvement. Procedures other than formal Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) can help prevent unauthorized appropriation but can also be undermined without effective recourse, so prompting the development of formal IPR mechanisms. These comprise sui generis systems, specially developed to protect plant varieties per se (Plant Variety Protection or Plant Breeders' Rights) and utility patents. The ultimate goal of IPR is to provide benefits to stakeholders and, ultimately, the public at large. Achieving this goal depends upon balancing the possibility of reward to the developer with benefits that can then flow to others. While not necessarily providing a silver-bullet, the availability of effective IPR is an important component of business decisions affecting research and product development. Complementarity and individual flexibilities allow tailoring of IPRs to best support agricultural production and societal needs. Research, product development, socioeconomic, and cultural environments are complex, interactive, and dynamic. Consequently, IPRs are subject to scrutiny and change. This review provides examples of these complexities, their influence upon IPRs to date, and upon associations between IPRs and accrual of benefits.",2020,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,0

This article analyzes the direct impacts of IP on innovation performance in sub-Saharan Africa, namely patents, copyrights, industrial designs, and trademarks. The paper responds to firms extracting value from intellectual property strategies through innovation activities and overall performance. Using the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) and Innovation Follow-up Survey (IFS), we find that appropriation channels are essential for transforming innovation pursuits into a competitive advantage. Our results further reinforce that appropriation mechanisms are crucial to innovation and may allow firms to gain returns on their innovation activities. Regardless of the weaknesses and limitations of the patenting strategy in sub-Saharan Africa, the probability of patenting an innovation relates to a process and product innovation while controlling for several other effects. More importantly, we demonstrate how industrial designs and improved or changed trademarks can foster inclusive performance. In addition, we show that beyond perception-based innovations, intellectual property strategies also matter to innovation intensity and sales growth. Consequently, our results indicate that the significance of innovation for competitiveness puts intellectual capital at the critical juncture of knowledge management.",2024,Business & Economics,0

How venture capitalists evaluate young innovative company patent portfolios: empirical evidence from Europe,Venture capital; Young innovative company; Start-up; Patent portfolio; Asymmetric information; Signaling; O31; G24; L26; BLACK-BOX; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; SELECTION; CITATIONS; INVENTORS; MOTIVES; MARKETS; IMPACT; FIRMS,"Purpose This paper analyzes the importance given by venture capital (VC) firms to the different characteristics of the patent portfolio of a young innovative company (YIC). In an attempt to go beyond previous studies, the authors argue that not only is the size of a technological portfolio significant but also its nature. It is also examined whether the correlation between patents and VC financing varies across different industrial sectors and over different rounds of VC investments. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis has focused on a sample of 1,096 European YICs between the years 2010 and 2014. Target companies were identified in the monthly bulletins of Go4Venture, which reported the largest European deals and gathered information on the amount of VC financing. Additional data was derived from FinSMEs and crunchbase. Industrial sectors were differentiated according to their ability to appropriate the returns of innovation by relying on patent protection mechanisms. A multivariate regression framework at the patent family level was adopted to investigate empirical associations between the amount of VC financing and the characteristics of a YIC's patent portfolio. Findings The results confirm the positive value of patents. Both the size and the characteristics of a YIC patent portfolio have been found to be positively associated with the total amount of VC financing. Additionally, the correlation between a YIC patent portfolio and VC investment varies across industries and over rounds of funding. Although the number of patents is positively correlated with VC investments in sectors with strong Intellectual Property (IP) regimes, the same does not apply to sectors characterized by lower patent intensity, where qualitative metrics seem to have a stronger correlation. Significant differences have also been found for the different rounds of VC investments. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this paper are related to data availability. Empirical associations have been investigated, but causal effects cannot be ascertained in this framework. The authors focused on a sample of firms that received VC funding. Several transactions were excluded, due to a lack of specifications pertaining to the round series. Furthermore, a number of potential drivers of the financed amounts, such as variables related to the founder or the management team, have not been considered in this study. Practical implications For firms operating in sectors with weak IP regimes, patents are positively associated with attracting equity capital, if they are the output of R&D collaborations and have higher technical merit. In industries where patent intensity is higher, patent portfolio size matters more than quality. This suggests that VC investors award innovation quality to cases in which patenting is less frequent. Since the results indicate that positive associations between patenting and VC financing are more significant in later stages, managers should plan their patenting strategy in advance to reap the related benefits, and then collect the premium at later VC stages. Originality/value In this paper, the importance given by VC firms to different characteristics of a YIC patent portfolio has been analyzed in terms of size, quality, and complexity. While previous empirical analyses mainly focused on a single sector, the authors have examined whether the relevance of patents for VC financing decisions varies across industries and over different rounds of investment. The geographical coverage of the sample is another novelty of the paper. Previous works focused on a limited number of countries, whereas this research has considered firms operating in several European countries.",2020,Business & Economics,0
"Forecasting study of food-related patents protected by the University of Brasilia, Brazil: Case study",University of Brasilia; Patents; Food; Innovation; ,"Patents are important tools to protect innovations in the food industry. They are also indicators of the research and development of an institution. Universities play a significant role in generating and developing innovative technologies. Center for Support to Technological Development (CDT is the Technological innovation center (NIT) that is responsible for protecting the technologies developed by the academic community of the University of Brasilia (UnB). This case study analyzes the patents and patent applications related to food deposited by the UnB. For this purpose, a search was conducted on the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) institutional page through the patent database. The results show diverse applications to the food area that are mainly related to biotechnology. Half of the protections are still in progress in the INPI workflow. The requirements issued were primarily related to national genetic heritage. Archiving processes were identified due to non-payment, but we highlighted that it could be a strategic decision of NIT/CDT. Rejections were mainly related to the lack of novelty or inventive steps. Currently, two food-related patents are in force that took, on average, nine and a half years to be granted. Although UnB exclusively owns the majority, the results also evidence co-ownership with other universities and companies. Finally, this study highlights possible partnerships between UnB and the food industry through technology transfer. The technology transfer indicators pointed out that UnB has expertise in this area and that there is a potential to be explored. These results contribute to strategic decision-making in developing new technologies related to food and nutrition and their transfer to society. The scale-up and the increased degree of maturity require greater interaction with the productive sector to ensure the transfer of technology for innovation arising from the research conducted at UnB.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
Pandemic-Resilient Investment: Sustainable Knowledge Infrastructure for Medical AI,Medial AI; Patent-sharing mechanisms; Innovation; Two-pronged solution; Knowledge sharing; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; PATENT; INNOVATION; FAIRNESS; LAW,"While the meteoric rise of medical AI promises transformative solutions to global health challenges, ensuring equitable access to these life-saving technologies remains a formidable obstacle. Policymakers wrestle with a seemingly impossible feat: fostering the continued innovation pipeline while bridging the stark divide in accessibility. Existing patent-sharing mechanisms, from compulsory licensing to voluntary pledges, have proven demonstrably insufficient, failing to strike the delicate balance between incentivizing innovation and guaranteeing widespread availability. This paper proposes a bold departure from these one-size-fits-all solutions. Drawing upon the principles of distributive justice, I present a two-pronged solution that tackles the issue from both ends of the spectrum. On the macro level, it calls for international collaboration and reciprocity among states, urging them to fulfill their shared responsibility in making patented medical technologies universally and affordably accessible. On the micro level, it compels patent holders to embrace ethical responsibility, challenging them to confront the inherent inequities of intellectual property protection. This novel framework represents a paradigm shift, holding immense potential to unlock a future where medical advancements reach every corner of the globe. Unlike its predecessors, it recognizes the intricate dance between innovation and access, offering a practical roadmap for policymakers and patent holders. By embracing cooperation and ethical responsibility, we can pave the way for a healthier world where the promise of medical AI translates into tangible improvements for people everywhere, not just a privileged few. This is not simply an academic pursuit but a call to action, a challenge to rewrite the narrative of medical technology distribution and forge a future where health equity reigns supreme.",2024,Business & Economics,0

The proposed issue is appropriately under the protection of intellectual property for solving as described in patent no.B1 230665 PL in the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland. In the solution presented herein, de-icing is achieved mainly by electrodynamic force excitation and secondarily as a result of heating. Because ice is removed primarily through vibrations, it avoids a large consumption of electricity associated with the high specific heat of water. More importantly, operation is nearly simultaneously applied to the total distance of the trolley power grid between two substations. For this reason, it requires less electricity consumption and less time to apply than in heating, mechanical, or chemical methods.",2022,Energy & Fuels,0

Research in this field is therefore becoming increasingly essential. Much of the research is carried out in academic institutions and then developed in the private sector. Patents do not have to be issued through scientific institutions. Patents from scientific institutions are intended to have a certain economic return on the investment made in research when the patent is transferred to industry. A bibliometric analysis was carried out using the Scopus and SciVal databases. This study analyses all the research carried out in the field of agronomy and related sciences (Agricultural and Biological Sciences category of Scopus database) by EU-27 countries, which has been cited in at least one international patent. The data show that out of about 1 million published works only about 28,000 have been used as a source of patents. This study highlights the main countries and institutions in terms of this transfer. Among these, Germany, France and Spain stand out in absolute terms, but considering the degree of specialization.

The anti-monopoly regulation of reverse payment patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical industry in China*,Reverse payment patent settlement agreements (RPPSAs); patented drugs; generic drugs; competition law; ,"In recent years, the legality of reverse payment patent settlement agreements (RPPSAs) in the pharmaceutical industry has become a contentious issue and attracted the attention of antitrust authorities in many countries. It is a sophisticated intersection of patent protection - encouraging research and development in the pharmaceutical industry - and competition enforcement - maintaining fair and effective competition in the relevant market. Given the complexities, there is no unanimous approach adopted to deal with the compatibility of such RPPSAs with antitrust law. As China's legal and economic context has changed considerably, there will be great possibility that such RPPSAs will also appear in China. However, there has not been an effective anti-monopoly analysis framework established that focuses on regulating such RPPSAs in China. Therefore, this article proposes that China should prepare itself in advance from two perspectives. On the one hand, a competition inquiry should be conducted in China's pharmaceutical industry to evaluate the development of RPPSAs; on the other hand, a basic analysis approach should be confirmed in the forthcoming anti-monopoly guidelines for intellectual property rights (IPRs). This article proposes that the anti-monopoly scrutiny should mainly focus on the patent settlement agreements with value transfer from a brand-name drug company to a generic one in exchange for the latter's commitment to delay market entry. Then, China's Anti-monopoly Law should be applied differently on the basis of the timing at which the generic drugs are permitted to enter the market. Finally, this article provides some important and typical factors of RPPSAs that should be examined carefully.",2020,Government & Law,0

By undertaking two tests using data of 1,696 observations across 95 countries during 2001-2018 and data of 906 observations covering 87 countries in the 1965-2015 period, we find that the linkage of IPR protection to TFP is negative in least-developed countries while inverted U-shaped in developing and developed countries. In addition, developed countries have the strongest IPR protection and least-developed countries offer the weakest protection, and the optimal IPR protection level for TFP in developed countries is greater than that in developing countries. This study enriches our knowledge of both antecedents of TFP and implications of IPR protection. It provides empirical support for the institution-based view of IPR history and extends the view to the context of developed countries. This study also informs policymakers the proper level of IPR protection if the goal is to promote TFP.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Stark Brothers' Nurseries & Orchards: Two Centuries of New Fruit Cultivars and Innovations,fruit; nuts; history; nurserymen; plant patents; ,"Established near Louisiana, MO in 1816, Stark Bro's Nurseries and Orchards Company has had a lasting impact on modern fruit production in the cultivars grown, nursery stock production practices, and the protection of plant material with patents. From Kentucky, James Hart Stark brought 'Jeniton' ('Rall's Janet') scions with him to Missouri and began propagating trees on native crabapple rootstock. As the family nurseries grew, Clarence M. Stark incorporated the business in 1889 and astutely established a relationship with Luther Burbank to acquire new plant material. 'Delicious', 'Golden Delicious', and 'Gala' apple, along with many spur-type and dwarf types of these cultivars, are but a few of the notable cultivars that Stark Bro's purchased from individuals. In an attempt to protect their acquisitions, Paul C. Stark Sr. was a primary advocate for plant patent legislation. In 1932, the first fruit tree patent was assigned to Stark Bro's for 'Hal-Berta Giant' peach, with many more to follow for such cultivars as 'July Elberta' and 'Saturn' peach. Over time, Stark Bro's has been the assignee for about 131 fruit and nut patents. They also revolutionized the tree fruit industry with the introduction of spur-type apple trees, development of a mechanical tree digger, and the initiation of a virus-indexing program. Weathering boom years and lean times, when many fruit nurseries failed, Stark Bro's Nurseries continues to provide an array of plant material to commercial producers and backyard gardeners.",2021,Agriculture,0

Therefore, this article aims to verify whether human capital, education, and patents positively affect economic growth in Scandinavian countries during the period 1990 to 2019. For this purpose, we use Westerlund (2007) Panel cointegration tests and Cross-Sectionally Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) model with pooled mean group (PMG) estimators. We also apply the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) Granger non-causality tests. This study is significant in two ways. Firstly, based on endogenous growth theory and Quadruple Helix model, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effects of human capital use, innovative activity, and patent protection, on economic growth. Secondly, the article makes an empirical contribution for a better understanding of the modes of economic growth based on knowledge. The methodology used considers both cross-sectional dependence and cross-country heterogeneity. The empirical results indicate a stable long-run cointegrating relationship between education, life expectancy at birth, population, gross fixed capital formation, and growth. Our empirical results also show that the number of patents in Scandinavian countries has a statistically significantly positive effect on economic growth. Also, we have marked a negative effect of Expenditure on Education on economic growth. Understanding and achieving sustainable growth based on innovation and knowledge are possible through the triple helix approach. This approach can be described as a framework which allows to better understand interactions between universities, governments, and industries. Our results imply that further work is needed to integrate the relatively recent concepts of Triple/Quadruple/Quintuple Helix at the level of analysis the interactions between patents, education, human capital, and growth.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Intellectual Property Rights and Foreign Technology Licensing in Developing Countries: An Empirical Investigation,; PATENT PROTECTION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INNOVATION,"This paper addresses the question of whether expanded and strengthened protection of intellectual property (IP) rights fosters technology transfer to developing countries, which is one of the premises of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Cross-sectional analysis of a representative sample of firms operating in 42 developing economies indicates that going from no IP protection to maximum IP protection is associated with a 65% increase in the predicted probability of licensing foreign technology for the subpopulation of affiliated firms, whereas the predicted probability is not significantly different from zero for unaffiliated firms. We also find evidence that the environment in which a firm operates moderates the relationship of IP protection and firm-level technology licensing: although going from no IP protection to maximum IP protection is associated with a 47% increase in the predicted probability of licensing foreign technology for firms operating in upper-middle-income countries, there is at best no significant correlation for firms operating in lower-middle-income and low-income countries.",2020,Area Studies; Development Studies; Business & Economics,0

Although extant research has shown that terrorism can reduce aggregate investment levels, little attention has been paid to the impact of terrorism on firms' R&D in a global context. Drawing on real options theory, we argue that terrorism will lead firms to reduce their R&D investment because terrorism-induced uncertainty increases the value of the deferral option in R&D. However, strong national institutions, including strong patent rights protection and low expropriation hazards, will mitigate firms' disincentive to invest in R&D stemming from uncertainty. Further, multinational firms, larger firms, as well as firms with greater cash flow will be less sensitive to uncertainty in their R&D decisions. Our hypotheses are supported by a battery of tests, including the use of a quasi-experiment, based on firm-level panel data from 48 countries.",2022,Business & Economics,0

However, the dynamic essence of IP as an institutional context, particularly its setback and reversal, has received little attention. Through the lens of institutional dynamics theory, this study identifies four asymmetric categories of IP institutional dynamics: accelerating reforms, decaying reforms, decaying reversals, and accelerating reversals in a typical emerging market, China. Favorable institutional dynamics (i.e. accelerating reforms and decaying reversals) improve firms' R&D efficiency, whereas unfavorable institutional dynamics (i.e. decaying reforms and accelerating reversals) reduce R&D efficiency.

Using green patent data of listed companies in heavy polluting industries from 2011 to 2016, we find that China's carbon emissions trading pilot policy has induced green innovation of firms in pilot areas.

Plant Science and Intellectual Property Protections in Taiwan*,; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; PUBLIC RESEARCH; RIGHTS; INDUSTRY; UNIVERSITY; INNOVATION; US; VARIETIES; EXCHANGE; BENEFITS,"Beginning in 1980, and due to a number of significant court decisions, legislative initiatives and international economic agreements, there has been an increase in the importance and use of intellectual property mechanisms, such as patents, in protecting biological materials, including seeds and engineered crop traits. The trend originated in the U.S. but has since diffused to OECD and non-OECD nations. A parallel but related set of policies designed to promote the patenting of university and federally funded research discoveries has also become evident in the U.S. and globally. In this paper, we discuss the trend toward more restrictive IP protections in agriculture through national-level policies and international economic agreements especially for new plant varieties. We then present the case of plant science research in Taiwan, including interviews with 15 plant scientists, to illustrate how transnational trends can impact and interact with national level policies and practices. And, how research scientists can play critical roles in furthering or retarding the progression of the proprietary research model in plant science.",2021,Sociology,0
COVID-IP: staring down the Bayh-Dole Act with 2020 vision,food and drug law; intellectual property; ,"As the human and economic toll of the COVID-19 coronavirus steadily escalates, there is extreme uncertainty regarding the timeframe for prevention, detection, and treatment.(1) There is also concern about the eventual costs associated with approved products and the barriers to access created by the patent system. Industry, government, and academic collaborations are leading the charge in the discovery race, partnerships which have triggered calls for the activation of the federal governments so-called march-in rights established in the Bayh-Dole Act.(2) The Bayh-Dole Act dramatically altered the patent protections available to federally funded institutions and initiated a 40-year debate over appropriate incentives for innovation and the scope of the government's authority. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to reflect on the purpose and impact of the historic legislation as well as contemplate the implications for our public health future. Patent rights for therapeutic compounds, methods of delivery, and medical diagnostics will significantly impact access to and cost of life-saving innovations.

Feature and Tendency of Technology Transfer in Z-Park Patent Cooperation Network: From the Perspective of Global Optimal Path,Patent Cooperation; Innovation Network; Industrial Integration; Z-Park; MANAGING INNOVATION,"Purpose: This study aims to provide a new framework for analyzing the path of technology diffusion in the innovation network at the regional level and industrial level respectively, which is conducive to the integration of innovation resources, the coordinated development of innovative subjects, and the improvement of innovation abilities. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the Z-Park patent cooperation data, we establish Inter-Enterprise Technology Transfer Network model and apply the concept of Pivotability to describe the key links of technology diffusion and quantify the importance of innovative partnerships. By measuring the topologically structural characteristics in the levels of branch park and the technosphere, this paper demonstrates how technology spreads and promotes overall innovation activities within the innovation network. Findings: The results indicate that: (1) Patent cooperation network of the Z-Park displays heterogeneity and the connections between the innovative subjects distribute extremely uneven. (2) Haidian park owns the highest pivotability in the IETTN model, yet the related inter-enterprise patent cooperation is mainly concentrated in its internal, failing to facilitate the technology diffusion across multiple branch parks. (3) Such fields as electronics and information and advanced manufacturing are prominent in the cross-technosphere cooperation, while fields such as new energy and environmental protection technology can better promote industrial integration. Research limitations: Only the part of the joint patent application is taken into account while establishing the patent cooperation network. The other factors that influence the mechanism of technology diffusion in the innovation network need to be further studied, such as financial capital, market competition, and personnel mobility, etc. Practical implications: The findings of this paper will provide useful information and suggestions for the administration and policy-making of high-tech parks. Originality/value: The value of this paper is to build a bridge between the massive amount of patent data and the nature of technology diffusion, and to develop a set of tools to analyze the nonlinear relations between innovative subjects.",2021,Information Science & Library Science,0
India's Distinct but Opposing Patent Model Is Under Pressure: Prospects and Challenges in the Global Arena,ASEAN; India; Section 3(d); RCEP; TRIPS; WTO; TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION; MEDICINES; ACCESS; AGREEMENT; POLICY,"The Indian patent model is a powerful and well-balanced model that not only complies with the requirements of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) but also considers domestic needs and national interest. This study endorses India's approach of fully availing itself of public health flexibilities provided in the TRIPS Agreement. India's well thought out patent model contradicts with the pro-patentee approaches taken by the European Union, the USA and Japan. This study emphasises the challenges and pressures faced by the Indian patent model because of the closer harmonisation agenda being pushed by some high-income countries through bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. This study argues that in order to effectively respond to harmonisation demands, India needs to be proactive in terms of building regional coalitions and transmitting its model to other like-minded Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries with similar interests. This is a viable approach because most of the ASEAN countries, despite different levels of development and industry, are facing similar challenges in terms of universal access to affordable medicines.",2024,International Relations,0

However, there has been little emphasis on the role of patent remedies in profiting from innovation via licensing. To address this gap, we examined the impact of patent remedies on technology licensing. Our study exploited a US Supreme Court decision that reduced the probability of issuing injunctions as a remedy to compare US firms' licensing propensity with that of a matched control group of European firms. We found that the decision reduced, on average, US firms' propensity to license. This effect is driven mainly by small firms and especially those in discrete technology industries. This research contributes to the literature on profiting from innovation and presents several implications for firms' licensing strategies.Managerial Summary: This study demonstrates how patent remedies (i.e., injunctions vs. ongoing royalties) differentially influence firms' incentives to engage in technology licensing. We suggest that injunctions cast a credible threat to potential licensees' product market activities, enhance the bargaining power of licensors in negotiations, and increase the likelihood of making a deal. Our research shows that when the probability of obtaining an injunction declines, firms are less likely to capture value by out-licensing their technological innovations. Especially for small firms, profiting from innovation via licensing becomes challenging. This effect exacerbates when small firms operate in discrete technology industries. These findings imply that in such conditions, firms may benefit from other value capture mechanisms, such as entering the product market or forming partnerships with industry incumbents.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Intellectual Property Rights Issues in Indian Pharmaceutical Industry,Intellectual property rights; patent; research & development; clinical trials; copyrights; generic drugs etc; ,"Historically, India has neglected, and even made a farce of, pharmaceutical patents. In fact, it was not until 2005 that India offered patent protections for pharmaceutical companies at all. This has led to abuses of the compulsory licensing agreement with the World Trade Organisation, and has led to major criticisms of other global pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Roche, and Bayer. According to these companies, India's generic drug manufacturing industry is destroying R&D funding and future innovation. This is because the companies which invented the brand name drugs are not receiving royalties; and therefore, losing out on profit, a lot of which would have been put back into R&D. While the World Trade Organisation under the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement (Doha Declaration) has provided for the use of compulsory licenses (temporary patent rights for life-saving pharmaceuticals), recently India has been more lenient in its use of this stipulation. In fact, the first use was in 2012 for Nexavar. Since then India has used the compulsory licensing provision at least five times. The total numbers of Indian Pharmaceutical Companies those who are having Research and Development facilities and also having Intellectual Property Rights for the past five years consecutively are take for this study.",2021,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,0
How Should We Enforce Patents? A Simulation Analysis,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; MERGERS,"Patent damages and patent breadth are substitutes in producing innovation incentives. That is, given any existing damages and breadth regime, we can decrease (increase) damages and increase (decrease) breadth to keep the expected profit from an innovation constant. By use of numerical simulations, we show that for any given level of ex ante innovation incentive, ex post welfare is generally larger under regimes with smaller damages and larger breadth. We use this same simulation approach to analyze whether patent damages based on lost profits should be evaluated using actual lost profits (actual damages) or what lost profits would be assuming competition (competitive damages). While actual damages lead to smaller benefits from entry, they also induce more entry. Our simulation explores the conditions under which one approach is generally superior to the other (again, holding constant the innovator's expected profit so that the choice of damage measurement regime does not affect the incentive to innovate). Although not universally true, we find that for optimal combinations of damages and patent breadth, competitive damages are superior to actual damages. Over the last several decades, patent enforcement in the United States has relied more on damage awards and less on outright exclusion.(1) Much has been written on this tradeoff,(2) but less has been written on the question of how damages should be measured, and how damages interact with other levers of patent policy. Economists typically view patents as a way of rewarding inventors so as to encourage innovation, with the cost of reducing access to patented inventions.(3) Efficient patent policy maximizes the rewards to inventors while minimizing the social costs of reduced access. There are a number of ways to alter policy to increase the value of a patent: we could make patents longer,4 we could make patents broader (that is to say, we could increase patent coverage to apply to more competing products), or we could increase the penalties for infringement. This paperfocuses on the tradeoff between the breadth of a patent and the strength and manner of patent enforcement. That is, for a given level of innovation incentive society wants to provide to an innovator, we analyze the effects of providing this level of incentive through larger damages and narrower patent breadth or through smaller damages and broader patent breadth. We use simulation analysis to study the effects of using damages rather than injunctions to enforce patents, and we simulate the effects of reducing damages for infringement while broadening patents to keep the effective value of patent protection constant. We also consider two distinct ways of computing patent damages: actual damages and what we call competitive damages. Under competitive damages, damages are set by the effect on the inventor's profits of a hypothetical entrant that is not subject to damages for patent infringement. As a result, once there is entry, damages do not depend on the entrant's behavior. Thus, an entrant does not have an incentive to forego vigorous competition so as to maintain the original inventor's profits and minimize damages. With actual damages, damages are set by how much the inventor's profits actually decreased, so that if an entrant does not compete vigorously, the inventor's profits decrease less, and the damage award is lower. As far as we know, no one has analyzed the competitive damages alternative to actual damages. We use our simulation analysis to again determine the consequences of using one or the other method of computing damages while keeping the incentive to innovate constant. We consider a model of horizontal competition.(5) These models are frequently used by economists to examine the effects of regulation on producers and consumers under competition.(6) In this model, we assume that products are of similar quality, but individual consumers have an idiosyncratic preference for some attributes of the products. We model the attributes of the product as a location on a horizontal line. The distance between the products represents the degree of difference consumers perceive between them. If they are close, then consumers may have a slight preference for one or the other, but view them as close substitutes. If they are far apart, then most consumers strongly prefer one product or the other. In this model, patent breadth refers to the maximum distance from a patent-holder for which the original inventor can enforce its patent against a new product that enters the market. The idea is that broad patents may exclude products that differ significantly from the patented invention, but narrow patents only exclude close substitutes. We use simulation analysis, in which we randomly assign values to the parameters. For example, we run the model with a variety of values for the original patent breadth and entry costs. We then solve our model with these random values to estimate the consequences on competitive entry and consumer welfare. We generally find that reducing damages and increasing patent breadth leads to greater social welfare by allowing entry when it is most socially beneficial. Furthermore, we find that competitive damages lead to more consumer welfare than actual damages, even though it may lead to less entry, because it allows consumers to reap the full competitive benefits of entry when it occurs.",2020,Government & Law,0
Intellectual property rights protection and the dynamic gains from trade,International trade; Welfare gains from trade; Economic growth; Intellectual property rights; F10; F12; F13; O31; O41; ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; SCHUMPETERIAN MODEL; LIBERALIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; INNOVATION; DIFFUSION; IMITATION; IMPACT,"This paper presents a dynamic general equilibrium model with two structurally identical open economies. Trade liberalization promotes innovation and growth when intellectual property rights (IPR) protection is sufficiently weak. Trade on the other hand does not affect innovation and growth when IPR protection is strong. We show that this result holds for both horizontal and vertical endogenous growth models, which have so far had contradictory predictions on how trade affects innovation. The reason for this supposed contradiction are implicit IPR protection assumptions in the two different types of growth models, strong protection in the horizontal model and weak protection in the vertical model. The IPR protection assumption makes a big difference for the size of the gains from trade. In a simple numerical example we show that assuming weak IPR protection can imply more than five times higher overall gains from trade. We also build a North-South model and add another aspect of IPR protection influencing the duration of Northern patents, namely imitation in the South. In the asymmetric model with a competitive fringe in the South, IPR protection no longer plays a crucial role for the dynamic gains from trade.",2024,Business & Economics,0

An Organizational Theory of International Technology Transfer,; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; KNOWLEDGE-BASED THEORY; TACIT KNOWLEDGE; FIRM; INNOVATION; TRADE; CAPABILITIES; ECONOMICS; NETWORK; POLICY,"International technology transfer plays a critical role in advancing economic and social welfare around the world. Conventional wisdom holds that strong intellectual property rights-primarily patents-promote the transfer of technologies between countries. An important counternarrative, however, contends that weakening patents promotes important forms of technology transfer. This Article challenges the centrality of both perspectives by arguing that neither strengthening nor weakening patents is sufficient to transfer many technologies. This Article disaggregates international technology transfer into its constituent activities, focusing on the important processes by which technical knowledge itself moves between countries. In theory, patents play an important role in the international transfer of technical knowledge because, among other functions, they require inventors to disclose their inventions. In practice, however, such disclosure is often inadequate. This Article argues that multinational organizational structures play an important and underappreciated role in transferring technical knowledge between countries, even for inventions that are ostensibly disclosed in patents. In so doing, this Article offers a new gloss on the knowledgebased theory of the firm. In pertinent part, the knowledge -based theory of the firm emphasizes the advantages of transferring tacit knowledge-personal, experiential knowledge that is not amenable to codification (and not disclosed in patents)-within firms as opposed to between separate firms. This Article extends this theory in two ways to articulate a novel knowledge -based theory of bounded entities. First, it argues that firms (and organizations more broadly) provide a hospitable environment for transferring not only tacit knowledge but also trade secrets-secret, technical information that may or may not be codified. Second, it argues that the knowledge -transfer advantages of organizations extend beyond classic, integrated firms to a broader class of bounded entities. Such entities, which span integrated and quasi -integrated organizational forms, facilitate the transfer of tacit knowledge and trade secrets. Drawing on this novel theory, this Article argues that multinational bounded entities-which include multinational firms, foreign -domestic joint ventures, and thick cross -border contractual relationships-greatly facilitate the transfer of technical knowledge abroad. They do so even for inventions that have been publicly disclosed in patents and even when innovators would ordinarily assert intellectual property rights to limit such transfer. Illustrating these dynamics, this Article explores the role of multinational bounded entities in the global manufacturing of patented COVID-19 vaccines and forced technology transfer in the U.S.-China trade war. Going further, this Article synthesizes the roles of patents and organizations in international technology transfer, arguing that the strength of patent protection and the nature of technology to be transferred help determine the most effective transfer channels. It then provides prescriptions for improving international technology transfer through patent -based channels and multinational bounded entities.",2023,Government & Law,0
How do intercultural proximity and social fragmentation promote international patent cooperation?,Innovation; Culture; Gravity model; Trust; Acceptance and tolerance; L26; O30; Z10; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION PERFORMANCE; GRAVITY MODEL; DIVERSITY; RELIGION; TECHNOLOGY; LANGUAGE; CULTURE; TRUST,"Joint innovation across countries plays a vital role in international networks of knowledge-intensive businesses. We study how the cultural backgrounds of collaborators influence success in international innovation. Intercultural proximity implies shared values and norms that can engender trust and cooperation in innovation. However, social fragmentation can induce conflict and mistrust, whereas joint innovation can progress through the tolerance and acceptance of different views. Our gravity model analysis of international patent cooperation data shows that social fragmentation complements intercultural proximity along the social identity dimensions of religion, ethnicity, and language to promote joint innovation. Intercultural proximity operates through trust, especially for countries with weak intellectual property rights laws, while social fragmentation operates through tolerance and acceptance, especially for countries with strong IPR laws. Economic strength, trade, and institutional differences are also important predictors of collaborative innovation. We confirm that geographical distance between countries lowers cooperation, but it cannot explain away the positive effects of intercultural proximity and social fragmentation. Co-innovation increases with intercultural proximity - and even more so when countries are socially fragmented. International joint innovation allows knowledge-intensive businesses to synergistically draw upon the ideas, expertise, and experience of innovators from their respective cultures (countries). However, such collaborations are often hampered by the uncertainty of partner exploitation and free-riding especially in the absence of formal institutions such as strong intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. In such cases, while intercultural proximity (e.g., along the dimensions of religion, ethnicity, and language) can promote cooperation through the informal institution of trust, social fragmentation can induce mistrust and in turn hamper collaboration. This is puzzling in light of evidence that fragmentation also promotes innovation. Thus, we empirically show that the positive effect of intercultural proximity operates through trust especially when IPR protection is weak. The positive effect of fragmentation on international patent cooperation operates through tolerance and acceptance especially when IPR protection is strong. This implies that nurturing tolerance and acceptance while strengthening IPR and developing the intellectual property ecosystem in fragmented societies, building intercultural trust, and increasing diversity in countries, alliances, or firms can promote co-patenting success.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Evolutionary Game Analysis of Firms' Technological Strategic Choices: A Perspective of the Behavioral Biases,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PROSPECT-THEORY; RISK; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; SPILLOVERS; IMITATION; COLLABORATION; UNCERTAINTY,"To reveal the mechanisms of firms' technological strategic choices between innovation and imitation, an evolutionary game model is proposed from the perspective of the behavioral biases. First, behavioral biases such as reference point dependence, loss aversion, and probability weighting can be defined and modeled based on the prospect theory. Second, according to the firm theory, a Cournot or Stackelberg game modeled with a technology spillover effect and intellectual property protection is applied to portray the interaction between firms. Third, an improved evolutionary game model is provided by incorporating behavioral biases into the framework of the decision-making process. Finally, the simulation analysis of some important factors, such as intellectual property protection, patent fees, innovation risks, decision-making attitudes, and consumers' price preference on firms' technological strategic choices, is presented. The corresponding results show that (1) innovation risk is an important factor affecting the technological strategic choices of firms, (2) increasing the intellectual property protection and the patent fee for technology transfer can effectively control the spillover effect of technology, (3) there is a partial U-shaped relationship between the consumers' price preference and innovation, and (4) the behavioral biases such as reference point dependence, loss aversion, and probability weighting will change the perception of payoff and risk and will eventually induce firms to adopt the innovation strategy.",2021,Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
"Patent term extension and test data protection obligations: identifying the gap in policy, research, and practice of implementing free trade agreements",; INNOVATION; ACCESS,"Much of the academic literature criticizes the inclusion of patent term extensions (PTE) and test data protection into the pharmaceutical provisions and/or intellectual property (IP) chapters of free trade agreements (FTAs), with many arguing that such provisions will increase the cost of pharmaceuticals for the implementing government. Such arguments are often backed by studies conducted prior to the conclusion of the relevant FTA. This is problematic for several reasons, most notably that the studies make assumptions that subsequently turn out not to be false and that the claims are not revisited and supported with empirical data following implementation. This article reviews the experience of two jurisdictions - Canada and Australia - in order to provide an analysis of legislative and judicial practices with a focus on implications and the cost of FTAs. The article examines how Canada and Australia have implemented their FTA obligations domestically and on the hereto ignored but important role of courts. One key finding is how courts in both countries are vigilant in narrowing the scope of obligations under FTAs to accommodate the need of the domestic market. The article ultimately concludes by calling on governments to conduct a detailed analysis of PTE and test data protection so as to better inform and prepare policymakers and, ultimately, improved FTA provisions and health outcomes.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Medical Ethics; Legal Medicine,0

Against this background, Zurich University's Center for Intellectual Property and Competition Law is conducting, together with the Swiss Intellectual Property Institute, a research and policy project that explores the future of intellectual property law in an AI context. This paper briefly describes the AI/IP Research Project and presents an initial set of policy recommendations for the development of IP law with a view to AI. The recommendations address topics such as AI inventorship in patent law; AI authorship in copyright law; the need for sui generis rights to protect innovative AI output; rules for the allocation of AI-related IPRs; IP protection carve-outs in order to facilitate AI system development, training, and testing; the use of AI tools by IP offices; and suitable software protection and data usage regimes.",2023,Government & Law,0
A Method to Evaluate Network Efficiency in Industrial Knowledge Transfer: Results From the Delta Region,Technological innovation; Knowledge engineering; Patents; Organizations; Knowledge transfer; Weight measurement; Industrial communication; Industrial knowledge transfer network; knowledge transfer; patent transfer; patent-intensive industry; network efficiency; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; INNOVATION NETWORK; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; DIFFUSION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; CHINA,"The efficiency of industrial knowledge transfer (IKT) directly affects the level of knowledge connection and collaborative innovation in the industry. However, there is a lack of research, particularly from the perspective of network characteristics, to investigate the efficiency of IKT. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology for measuring the efficiency of weighted industrial knowledge transfer network (IKTN) by employing multiple network indicators. Firstly, based on patent data, a weighted IKTN model with node and edge weights is constructed, and the weighted clustering coefficient and path length of the network are defined. Then, considering the indicators of node weights, edge weights, weighted clustering coefficient, and path length, an efficiency measurement model for the weighted IKTN is established. Finally, we take the environmental protection industry (EPI) in the Yangtze River Delta region of China as the practical case to verify the scientific validity and applicability of the proposed method. The results show that the measurement method proposed can effectively evaluate the node efficiency and overall efficiency of IKTN, and provide a scientific basis for relevant policymaking. This study comprehensively considered multiple factors in the IKTN efficiency measurement and used existing data from the patent database in the weight setting, avoiding the problem of excessive reliance on subjective factors in previous studies that may lead to deviations in the authenticity of the evaluation.",2023,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,0
The Gewirthian Needs-Based Hierarchy: A Concept for Prioritising Conflicting Norms in International Law,International law; access to medicines; right to health; legal hierarchy; treaty law; IP; patent rights; TRIPS; RIGHTS; DIGNITY; ACCESS,"International law is divided into functionally detached treaty regimes which lack clear hierarchies between them. Specific rules on how to prioritise among conflicting norms, e.g. between international patent rights under the World Trade Organisation TRIPS regime and the fundamental right to health under United Nations human rights law, are missing. Political sentiments and economic policies often tend to prioritise business interests, including the protection of pharmaceutical patents held by multinational corporations, over contrasting societal interests, which has direct negative impacts on the realisation of economic and social human rights. In this context, this article takes account of moral philosophical reasoning, with particular consideration to the needs-based hierarchy established by Alan Gewirth in his conceptualisation of the principle of generic consistency. The article shows how, when applied to the concept of human dignity, the needs-based hierarchy can provide guidance on adequate prioritisation among conflicting legal norms, suggesting the necessity of protecting the most fundamental human needs over less essential economic interests.",2023,Government & Law,0
Algorithmic decision-making employing profiling: will trade secrecy protection render the right to explanation toothless?,Copyright; DPD; GDPR; Machine learning; Patent; Patent value; Profiling; Right to explanation; Trade secrecy; ,"Algorithmic decision-making based on profiling may significantly affect people's destinies. As a rule, however, explanations for such decisions are lacking. What are the chances for a right to explanation to be realized soon? After an exploration of the regulatory efforts that are currently pushing for such a right it is concluded that, at the moment, the GDPR stands out as the main force to be reckoned with. In cases of profiling, data subjects are granted the right to receive meaningful information about the functionality of the system in use; for fully automated profiling decisions even an explanation has to be given. However, the trade secrets and intellectual property rights (IPRs) involved must be respected as well. These conflicting rights must be balanced against each other; what will be the outcome? Looking back to 1995, when a similar kind of balancing had been decreed in Europe concerning the right of access (DPD), Wachter et al. (2017) find that according to judicial opinion only generalities of the algorithm had to be disclosed, not specific details. This hardly augurs well for a future right of access let alone to explanation. Thereupon the landscape of IPRs for machine learning (ML) is analysed. Spurred by new USPTO guidelines that clarify when inventions are eligible to be patented, the number of patent applications in the US related to ML in general, and to predictive analytics in particular, has soared since 2010-and Europe has followed. I conjecture that in such a climate of intensified protection of intellectual property, companies may legitimately claim that the more their application combines several ML assets that, in addition, are useful in multiple sectors, the more value is at stake when confronted with a call for explanation by data subjects. Consequently, the right to explanation may be severely crippled.",2022,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Information Science & Library Science; Philosophy,0
FAIR USE IN ORACLE: PROXIMATE CAUSE AT THE COPYRIGHT/PATENT DIVIDE,; TORT LAW; PROPERTY,"In Oracle America, Inc. v. Google LLC, the Federal Circuit undermined copyright law's deference to patent law and, in doing so, delivered a blow to both regimes. Copyright's deference to patent law-including a historic refusal to enforce rights that might undermine the public's liberty to copy unpatented inventions-is a necessary part of preserving inventors' willingness to accept the short duration, mandatory disclosure, and other stringent bargains patent law demands. Deference to patent law is also integral to copyright law's interior architecture; copyright's refusal to monopolize functional applications of creative work lowers the social costs that would otherwise be imposed by copyright's ease of acquisition and long duration. If patent law refuses to protect a functional device or other innovation (perhaps because its patent has expired or because the innovation would be obvious to anyone skilled in the field), various copyright doctrines make it difficult for an eager claimant to use copyright law instead. These doctrines act like fences. For example, under 17 U.S.C. 102(b), copyright cannot extend to ideas or to any procedure, process, system, [or] method of operation. This prohibition applies regardless of the copyrighted form in which the idea, procedure, process, or method appears. Therefore, the public violates no copyright duties when it copies, say, ideas about how to improve the manufacture of steel from a copyrighted instruction manual or video. If the creator of the manufacturing idea wants protection for it, the inventor needs to look to patent law. Similarly, although copyright can subsist in drawings of a useful article, 17 U.S.C. 113(b) and the case law disable those copyrights from giving any rights to keep others from making or selling the article. Say the inventors of an automobile engine with improved fuel efficiency want to restrain others from building and selling copycat engines. To restrain such functional copying, the inventors get no mileage out of the copyrights that subsist in their blueprints. Rather, to stop competitors from building and selling the new engine, the inventors must seek the protection of patent law. Under yet another statutory rule, 17 U.S.C. 101, sculptured shapes that have an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information are not copyrightable unless their aesthetic and functional components are separable. The instant Article discusses these and other limits on copyright law. Their overall impact is to emphasize the importance Congress and the courts give to preventing copyright law from directly or indirectly competing with patent law, or undermining the choices Congress embedded in the patent statute. Computer-program copyrights were intended to protect a programmer's expression, not their engineering ingenuity. As technology poses new challenges, separate intellectual property laws need to keep congruent with the separate purposes each serves. The Supreme Court has granted certiorari in Oracle, allowing the Court to evaluate a judicial opinion that this Article argues ignored these first principles. A need for congruence (or fit) is recognized in most areas of civil liability. For example, in enforcing the Clayton Act, the Supreme Court honored the need for congruence by creating a doctrine it called antitrust injury to limit liability. The common law of torts generally employs the doctrine called proximate cause to similarly assure fit between the facts of a given case and the law's purposes. In copyright law, the courts and Congress entrust this familiar but crucial task to fair use. The instant Article employs analogies from antitrust and the common law of torts to reinforce the appropriateness of using the fair use doctrine to keep copyright law in its own yard.",2020,Government & Law,0
The spatial difference-in-difference measurement of policy effect of environmental protection interview on green innovation,Green innovation; Environmental protection interview; Spatial difference -in -difference; Highly polluting enterprises; Spatial spillover effect; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; TRADE,"This study applies the classical difference-in-difference (DID) and spatial difference-in-difference (SDID) approach to measure the policy effect of the mandatory environmental protection interview (EPI) on green innovation with focus on 11,567 industrial manufacturing enterprises in Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China. Overall, the mandatory EPI has significantly promoted green innovation in industrial manufacturing enterprises in YRD by 0.399 units, which is greater than its promotion in green innovation for national industrial enterprises. Industrial manufacturing enterprises tend to increase utility patents more than invention patents under the impact on EPI. A heterogeneity analysis shows that EPI plays a larger role in promoting green innovation for highly polluting enterprises and privately owned enterprises than low polluting enterprises and state-owned enterprises. The innovative application of SDID approach precisely identifies that mandatory EPI has negative and positive effect on green innovation for the interviewed and non-interviewed neighbouring YRD cities. The EPI has a deterrent effect on the non-interviewed cities and stimulates their self-reliance innovation behaviours to realizing green innovation promotion. Except for the highly polluting enterprises with lower government environmental subsidy (GES) tending to purse more GI under EPI, the overall adjustment effect of GES on EPI to have a policy effect is insignificant.",2023,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0

The relationship between labor market institutions and innovation in 177 European regions over the period 2000-2015,Patents; EPL; Wage-setting institutions; Multilevel models; Spatial analysis; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FLEXIBLE LABOR; EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION; PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; MINIMUM-WAGES; PANEL; UNEMPLOYMENT; IMPACT; DEREGULATION,"The main goal of this paper is to investigate the relationship between labor market institutions (LMIs) and patents in 177 NUTS-1 and NUTS-2 European regions. Fixed effects models, ordinary least squares (OLS), the generalized method of moments estimation of the fixed effects (FE-GMM), multilevel modeling (MLM), and spatial models are employed. Patents are negatively correlated with EPL and union density and positively associated with wage bargaining coverage and centralization. As a result, a uniform wage that is higher than the competitive wage can enable the Schumpeterian creative destruction process, forcing firms to invest in innovation to remain in the market. Spatial analysis emphasizes that regional proximity promotes the flow of knowledge and increases the chance of innovation. Interactions also matter. Increased bargaining power and coordination, in particular, may outweigh the negative consequences of isolated EPL reforms. Thus, policies that strengthen wage-setting institutions are required in Europe to boost innovation.",2024,Business & Economics,0
Do intellectual property rights promote foreign direct investment inflows and technological exports in developing and developed countries?,Intellectual property rights; Foreign direct investment inflows; Technological exports; Utilitarian theory; Deterrence theory; Natural rights theory; F23; O34; O33; C23; PATENT RIGHTS; INNOVATION; INSTITUTIONS; PROTECTION; DETERMINANTS; REGRESSION; QUALITY; REGIMES; GROWTH; CHOICE,"PurposeThis study aims to analyse the intellectual property rights (INPR), foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and technological exports of 32 developing and developed countries for the period of 2006-2020.Design/methodology/approachDiagnostic tests were used to confirm the panel least squares, fixed effect, random effect, feasible general least squares, dynamic ordinary least squares and fully modified ordinary least squares estimator results as well as to increase the robustness.FindingsAccording to the findings for the developing countries, trademark, patent and industrial design applications, each had a significant positive long-run effect on FDI inflows.

"Trademarks, Own Brand Manufacturing, and Firm Growth at Different Stages of Development in Korea",Trademark; Own brand manufacturing; Original equipment manufacturing; Innovation; Korea; Patent; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; MARKET VALUE; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; PROTECTION; SMES,"This study attempts to verify the linkages between trademark registration and firm growth based on the different stages of development and two groups of sectors by using Korean firm data. Two different paths of firm growth in Korea are identified. In the trademark-dominant group, trademarks serve as a useful device for firm growth at the early stage of development, with technology at a low level, and then firms execute technological innovations to file more patents. In the patent-dominant group, utility models serve as a useful device for firm growth at the early stage of development, in which technology advancement is a prominent feature. Then, the sales growth of firms becomes positively associated with both patents and trademarks, the latter representing the effects of their brand power or the full transition to own brand manufacturing. Combined with the findings from the literature, this study finds that various types of intellectual property rights (IPRs) manifest differently for firms, from innovation to business growth, at different stages of economic development. A key lesson for catching-up economies is for conventional patents to not only consider the IPR type at the early stage of development in certain sectors but also take into account other IPRs, such as trademarks and utility models, to recognize and stimulate imitation and/or innovation. Innovation policy should be tailored not only toward the different stages of development and capabilities but also toward sectoral heterogeneity.",2023,Business & Economics,0
"NEW TYPE OF ANTIHAIL, ANTIRAIN AND ANTIFROST SYSTEM FOR PROTECTION OF ORCHARDS",fruit protection; rain cover; plastic cover; orchard protection; hail net; orchard protection; RAIN COVER PROTECTION; SWEET CHERRIES; CRACKING; TUNNELS; FROST,"The present paper presents a review regarding the use of nets and other plastic covers for the orchard protection against hail, rain and late frosts. The installation of the protection systems creates a modified microclimate that influences many orchard parameters and most of these modifications brings benefits for the farmers, as indicated by many studies made in the last decades. Two key factors that seem to be influenced in a positive manner by the plastic covers are the late frosts protection and the earlier maturation of the fruits. In the sweet cherry orchard from the Experimental field of USAMV Bucharest a roof plastic cover has been installed in order to study the evolution of the plants inside and outside the covered area. The new system which has been patented in 2020, assures protection against late frosts, hail and rain, sweet cherries being very susceptible to cracking caused by rain during the ripening season. During the study, will monitor the effectiveness of the protection as well as the impact of the system on the fruit set, the earliness of fruit production, yield quality and quantity, diseases impact and the general evolution of the cherry trees.",2021,Plant Sciences,0
Repositioning Generic Drugs: Empirical Findings and Policy Implications,Drug repositioning; Patent law; Regulatory protection; Clinical trials; Empirical study; Generic drugs; MEDICAL USES; PATENTS,"Commentators claim that drug repositioning (i.e. developing new uses for authorised drugs) significantly slows when generics are authorised and, therefore, law reform is necessary to encourage more R&D. This study empirically examines this claim by analysing records of clinical trials. It finds that once generics are authorised: (i) commercial trials continue at active rates for approximately half of the drugs studied, and (ii) the number of hospital and university trials actually increases. These findings cast doubt on whether additional incentives are needed. They also indicate that a more effective way to reposition drugs is for recently established government programmes to embrace IP strategies and leverage the hospital and university trials as an R&D pipeline.",2022,Government & Law,0
From strict moral standards to ethical neutrality: a policy-guided shift in the patentability of human embryonic stem cells in China,Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs); Ethics; Policy; Patentability; ,"Attitudes towards human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in China have witnessed a significant shift in 2020 that can be attributed to China's policy guidance. For ethical reasons, stricter standards are adopted to curb related regulations and patent licensing. Through the introduction of policies, some research on hESCs has been recognized as legitimate and feasible to a certain standard and scope. In the subsequent practice of patent examination, the dual influence of policy support and public interest has led to a shift in the examination standards of China's intellectual property authority from strict morality to ethical neutrality, implying limited recognition of hESCs' patentability. In view of the promotion of policy incentives for the transformation and application of corresponding research, there is considerable social demand to provide patent protection for research results. In this context, an adjustment of related regulations is illustrated in this revision, manifesting a partial shift in regulations towards a supportive stance consistent with policy.",2020,Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine,0

Historical account of dwindling national flexibilities from the Paris Convention to post-TRIPS era: What implications for access-to-medicines in low-and-middle-income-countries?,access to medicines; COVID-19; international patent law history; low-and-middle-income-countries; Paris Convention; TRIPS Agreement; TRIPS flexibilities; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; PATENTS; POLICIES; TRADE,"It is arguable that the most significant feature of the maiden Paris Convention is the creation of a remarkably broad national policy space which allowed Union members to balance the implementation of required obligations with the need to occasionally attend to national exigencies. Thus, a member may choose not to offer industrial property protection if national interests would be best served by doing so. While subsequent revisions to the Paris Convention chipped away at national flexibilities, the most strident attack to national flexibilities occurs under the Agreement for the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the period after it. This paper puts the almost-unnoticed whittling down of national flexibilities in international patent agreements in historical perspective. It subsequently discusses four ways through which this development could exacerbate access-to-medicines in low-and-middle-income-countries.",2022,Government & Law,0
The use of natural extracts with photoprotective activity: a 2015-2023 patent prospection,Photoaging; Photoprotection; Technological prospecting; Skin; ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; ANTIOXIDANT; SKIN; FLAVONOIDS; MECHANISMS; SUNSCREEN,"Synthetic sunscreen offers protection against excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, and protects the skin from possible damage. However, they have low efficacy against the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly reactive molecules that can be generated in the skin when it is exposed to UV radiation, and are known to play a role in oxidative stress, which can contribute to skin aging and damage. Thus, there is an ongoing search for sunscreens that do not have these negative effects. One promising source for these is natural products. Therefore, the current patent review summarizes topical formulations made from natural compounds that have antioxidant properties and can be used as photoprotective or anti-aging agents, either using a single natural extract or a combination of extracts. The review reports basic patent information (applicant country, type of applicant, and year of filing) and gives details about the invention, including its chemical composition, and the in vitro and in vivo tests performed. These patents describe natural products that can be used to protect the skin and validate their efficacy, and safety, in addition to standardizing their formulations. The compositions described illustrate the consistent innovation in the use of natural products to protect against UV damage and photoaging disorders, a promising field which is receiving growing global recognition.",2024,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics; Chemistry,0
DOES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION CONSTITUTE A BARRIER TO RENEWABLE ENERGY? AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS,intellectual property rights; renewable energy; innovation; technology ransfer; climate change mitigation; panel regression; PATENT PROTECTION; INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS; INVESTMENT,"This study uses an econometric approach to investigate the role of IPR protection on renewable energy adoption using panel data of 102 countries at five-year intervals over the period 1990-2005. The Ginarte-Park index is used as a measure of the strength of intellectual property protection while the adoption of renewable energy is measured by the share of renewable energy in total final energy use. The results reveal that the level of intellectual property rights protection and reform of the intellectual property rights regime do not have significant impact on renewable energy adoption, suggesting that IPR protection is not a cause for concern in the global quest for clean energy transition. On the contrary, we find that trade openness has a stronger influence in the transition to clean energy. Based on the findings of the study, we conclude that IPR protection does not influence renewable energy adoption except in high R&D countries; rather policy makers should concentrate efforts on economic factors, such as trade openness, that drive the adoption of renewable energy technologies.",2020,Business & Economics,0
What determines foreign direct investment to India's pharmaceutical sector? Intellectual property implementation versus inherent institutional strength,Asia; FDI; formal institutions; India; intellectual property rights; pharmaceuticals; TRIPS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; RIGHTS; PROTECTION; FDI,"The Indian pharmaceutical industry has assumed importance during the time of the pandemic. Historically, the absence of an intellectual property rights (IPR) regime in India helped reverse-engineer products, leading to an exponential growth of the industry. This, however, disincentivised foreign direct investment (FDI) needed for innovation. The ratification of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement in 1995 increased the confidence of foreign investors, allowing FDI inflow into the sector. However, we argue that the mere adoption of TRIPS is not sufficient for FDI and that its enforcement along with other institutional factors such as corruption and political stability play a crucial role. We also take into account competition for FDI among similarly placed nations, in this case from China. Methodologically, we construct a pharmaceutical patent index that measures the legal framework of IP protection specifically for the sector. An ARDL model using data from 1990 to 2019 shows that while the introduction of IPRs helped the inflow of FDI, the enforcement of these rights, as measured by the strengthening of the patent index, has led to a decrease in FDI. Interestingly, our results also show that India's own core competencies such as improving political stability while reducing corruption and trade barriers were the most dominant determinants. Through developing a concise sector-specific patent index and taking into account institutional determinants, FDI inflow is analysed in a manner not studied otherwise.",2022,Government & Law,0

Cambodia's Imminent Graduation from Least Developed Country Status: What Will be the Impact of the TRIPS Agreement on Access to HIV and Hepatitis C Medicines in Cambodia?,TRIPS; intellectual property; hepatitis C; antiretroviral; direct acting antiviral; patent; generic; HIV; Cambodia; ,"Cambodia has experienced exponential economic growth in recent years and is expected to graduate from least developed country (LDC) status within the next decade. Membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) will require Cambodia to grant product and process patents for pharmaceuticals upon LDC graduation. This study aims to measure the impact of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on the price of HIV and hepatitis C medicine in Cambodia once it graduates from LDC status and is obliged to make patents available for pharmaceutical products and processes. Using scenarios based on likely outcomes of accession to the TRIPS Agreement, it measures the impact on the price of the HIV treatment program and compares that impact with the hepatitis C treatment program. Graduation from LDC status would be expected to result in a modest increase in the cost of the antiretroviral (ARV) treatment program and very large increases in the cost of the direct acting antivirals (DAA) treatment program. If annual treatment budgets remain constant, patent protection could see 1,515 fewer people living with HIV able to access ARV treatment and 2,577 fewer people able to access DAA treatment (a drop in treatment coverage of 93%).",2024,Health Care Sciences & Services,0

COMPULSORY LICENSES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PATENTS IN CHINA IN LIGHT OF THE TRIPS AGREEMENT,compulsory license; pharmaceutical patents; TRIPS flexibility; the balance of interests; China; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; SYSTEM,"The recurrence of public health emergencies has made the issue of access to drugs a pertinent problem for developing countries. As a public health safeguard, the compulsory license system for patented pharmaceuticals is embodied in the international intellectual property (hereinafter IP) norms related to public health. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter TRIPS Agreement) flexibility is a double-edged sword for the pharmaceutical patent system in developing countries. On the one hand, the exception clauses to IP protection under the TRIPS Agreement, especially the compulsory licensing system, give member states the possibility of exempting their treaty obligations in the event of a public health crisis. On the other hand, the different interpretations deriving from the ambiguity of TRIPS ''flexibility defer members from implementing compulsory licensing in response to a public health crisis. China has established a systematic set of rules, including legislation and policies on compulsory licensing and integrated the TRIPS flexibility into Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). However, it still lacks clear procedural provisions regarding the compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical patents in the context of the public health crisis, which affects China's ability to use TRIPS flexibility of Compulsory licenses effectively.Furthermore, China's compulsory license law is never implemented despite the increasing need to ensure drug access and effectively respond to public health emergencies. This article aims to assess China's compulsory license system in light of the TRIPS Agreement. The article analyses how and why China's domestic compulsory license system fails to take advantage of TRIPS flexibility in substance and implementation. It suggests points for reform to enhance China's compulsory license system for pharmaceutical patents, which can effectively be utilized in public health emergencies, as well as heading towards better integration and implementation of the TRIPS flexibility, referring to the interest-balanced guiding principle.",2023,Health Care Sciences & Services; International Relations; Government & Law,0
Originality's Other Path,; COPYRIGHT; LAW; PERSPECTIVES,"Although the U.S. Supreme Court has famously spoken of a historic kinship between patent and copyright doctrine, the family resemblance is sometimes hard to see. One of the biggest differences between them today is how much ingenuity they require for earning protection. Obtaining a patent requires an invention so innovative that it would not have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art. Copyright, by contrast, makes no such demand on authors. It requires an original work of only minimal creativity. Except sometimes it doesn't. Puzzlingly, in some copyright cases dealing with musical arrangements, courts have demanded a patent-like level of creativity from putative authors. While these cases might seem like outliers, they have a pedigree that is both lengthy and largely unrecognized. The proposition that copyright originality should require patent-style inventiveness beyond artisans' everyday creations dates back to an 1850 music-infringement decision by Justice Samuel Nelson. In fact, only four months later, Nelson himself would author the Supreme Court patent opinion that is now credited as the touchstone for patent law's own nonobviousness doctrine. His corresponding vision for copyright, though, came first. Drawing on original archival research, this Article challenges the standard account of what originality doctrine is and what courts can do with it. It identifies Nelson's forgotten copyright legacy: a still-growing line of cases that treats music differently, sometimes even more analogously to patentable inventions than to other authorial works. These decisions seem to function as a hidden enclave within originality's larger domain, playing by rules that others couldn't get away with. They form originality's other path, much less trod than the familiar one but with a doctrinal story of its own to tell. Originality and nonobviousness's parallel beginnings reveal a period of leaky boundaries between copyright and patent, when many of the Justices considered a rule for one to be just as good for the other. Their recurring intersections, meanwhile, muddy today's conventional narrative about copyright's historic commitment to protecting even the most modestly creative works.",2021,Government & Law,0
THE COST OF NOVELTY,; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; ME-TOO DRUGS; PATENTS; INNOVATION; ATORVASTATIN; COMPETITION; RETHINKING; PROTECTION; STANDARDS,"Patent law tries to spur the development of new and better innovative technology. But it focuses much more on new than better-and it turns out that new carries real social costs. I argue that patent law promotes innovation that diverges from existing technology, either a little (what I call differentiating innovation) or a lot (exploring innovation), at the expense of innovation that tells us more about existing technology (deepening innovation). Patent law's focus on newness is unsurprising, and fits within a well-told narrative of innovative diversity accompanied by market selection of the best technologies. Unfortunately, innovative diversity brings not only the potential benefits of technological advances but also the costs: incompatibility between different technologies; a spread-out, shallow pool of knowledge; and the underlying costs of developing parallel technologies that aren't actually better. These costs matter. Biomedical innovation illustrates the high costs of divergence. Although pharmaceuticals are touted as a poster child for patents, the world is rife with me-too drugs that drive up costs with little to show for it. Biomedical innovation often suffers from a particular trap: Patent incentives push innovators toward new, but incentives from Food and Drug Administration approval and insurer reimbursement push innovators toward not too new. In this space, artificially constricted markets do a poor job of selecting better technologies. The result is a proliferation of technologies that are new for the sake of new, giving us the costs of divergence without much in the way of benefits. This Essay presents an original spectrum of innovative divergence, illuminates how various patent doctrines drive divergence, and lays out the substantial costs of divergence through biomedical examples. It analyzes the complex interactions between three different incentives for biomedical innovation and presents policy prescriptions to help avoid the trap of new for the sake of new. In the process, it lays out how innovation scholars and policymakers alike should take into account the cost of novelty.",2020,Government & Law,0
Did the pollution charge system promote or inhibit innovation? Evidence from Chinese micro-enterprises,Pollution charge system; Environmental protection tax system; Patent; Micro -enterprise; Enterprise innovation; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; FIRM SIZE; COMPETITION; ECONOMICS; IMPACTS; ENHANCE,"Studying the impact of the former Pollution Charge System (PCS) on enterprise innovation will provide a reference for China to improving the current environmental protection tax system (EPTS). Based on innovation panel data and the sewage charges applied to polluting enterprises in China, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of the PCS on enterprise innovation. The results show that the PCS significantly inhibits the patent output of enterprises. The study analyzes heterogeneity in these findings in three respects: enterprise scale, enterprise ownership, and regional development level. The results are as follows: 1) The PCS has a greater inhibitory effect on smaller enterprises' innovation than on larger enterprises; 2) The inhibitory effect on non-state-owned enterprises' innovation is greater than on state-owned enterprises; 3) The inhibitory effect is greater for enterprises located in western regions of China. We also use a difference-in-differences strategy to address endogeneity concerns. The mediation analysis finds that the mechanism of the PCS affecting innovation is to reduce enterprise cash flow and R&D expenditure.",2023,Business & Economics; Public Administration,0
"Accounting information quality, firm ownership and technology innovation: Evidence from China",Accounting information; Firm ownership; Technological innovation; Agency conflict; Proprietary cost; EARNINGS MANAGEMENT; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; INVESTOR PROTECTION; ANALYST COVERAGE; CEO TURNOVER; AGENCY COSTS; MARKETS; TRANSPARENCY; COMPETITION; VALUATION,"This study investigates whether and how accounting information quality (AIQ) affects innovation quality in emerging markets. Using a dataset of Chinese listed firms from 2009 to 2021, the results show that higher AIQ significantly boosts innovation, and the positive association is more pronounced for invention patents than noninvention patents. Moreover, AIQ improves the innovation efficiency of state-owned enterprises (SOE) more than non-state-owned enterprises (NSOE), whereas AIQ promotes the innovation output of NSOE more than SOE. In SOE, the governance role of AIQ contributes to greater innovation efficiency by monitoring resource allocation, while in NSOE, the implicit contracting role of AIQ motivates innovation efforts by reducing managers' career risks. Further analysis indicates that the positive relation between AIQ and innovation quality is more pronounced for firms with more severe agency conflicts and located in higher intellectual property protection regions. This research contributes to the literature on corporate governance and economic growth by identifying the different roles of AIQ in innovation across firm ownerships in the emerging market.",2024,Business & Economics,0
The Patents Māori Advisory Committee of Aotearoa New Zealand: Lessons for indigenous knowledge protection,indigenous knowledge; New Zealand; patent law; ,"Using freedom of information requests, we examine the operation of the Patents Maori Advisory Committee of Aotearoa New Zealand. The Committee advises the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand on whether inventions claimed in a patent application are derived from Maori traditional knowledge or from indigenous plants or animals; and if so, whether the commercial exploitation of that invention is likely to be contrary to Maori values. There is limited publicly available information on the operations of the Committee and the decision-making process undertaken in reviewing applications. The requests and our searches identified 13 patents referred to the Committee, of which most (9 of 13) dealt with inventions related to Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), a taonga species known for its role in producing unique honey. Only two applications have been found to be contrary to Maori values, and these applications have both since been abandoned. The review of applications found to be 'not contrary to Maori values' is instructive, identifying important considerations taken into account by the Committee in reaching a decision, including the importance of benefit sharing and engagement with Maori in considering whether an invention may be contrary to Maori values. The analysis highlights the limitations of the Committee in reviewing only those applications filed in Aotearoa New Zealand and referred to the Committee for advice and identifies the importance of mechanisms such as disclosure of origin to ensure all relevant applications are reviewed by the Committee. The paper concludes by highlighting how the operation of the Committee may inform the development of similar bodies in other jurisdictions, such as Australia.",2024,Government & Law,0
FDI inflows and intellectual property rights for MNEs in emerging markets: an alternative approach through the lens of trademarks in Vietnam (1986-2016),IPRs; Trademarks; FDI inflows; Emerging markets; Vietnam; MNEs; International business; Business history; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; PATENT RIGHTS; PROTECTION; INNOVATION; SPAIN; STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE; IMITATION; BUSINESS; MOTIVES,"Purpose While the current anti-globalisation wave is considered as a regional and cyclical relapse among Western countries, the new era of globalisation has shifted away from stagnant developed economies towards the rising prosperity of emerging Asia, where it is attracting substantial global inward foreign direct investment (FDI). Focussing on Vietnam, the country that is seen as Asia's next economic tiger, the question of how important intellectual properties (IP) protection is in the international competition for FDI inflows is still unsettled, especially on the under-researched topic of trademarks. Design/methodology/approach This paper takes on the business history approach, which allows rich evidence from the dynamic and evolving natures of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to drive the research process, so that international business scholars can test models rigorously. The evidence provided in this paper is essentially qualitative and combines trademark registrations data, with trade and FDI statistics between 1986 and 2016, also draws on companies' archives, industry reports and related newspaper articles. Findings This paper provides the chronology of intellectual property right (IPR) legal landscapes and the dynamic co-evolution of trademarks and FDI inflows in Vietnam. Three trademark protection strategies for MNEs and their patterns here are addressed. The paper also argues that trademarks bring new insights and IP protection strategy for pharmaceutical MNEs for the case of Vietnam is as important in trademarks as it is in patents. In emerging markets with strong incentives for FDI such as Vietnam, MNEs are not necessarily put off by weak IPR, but rather create alternative strategies for dealing with the lack of IP protection in these emerging market settings. Originality/value This study challenges the stream of thoughts that view trademarks as a neglected intangible asset among different IPRs, while in fact, trademarks advance MNEs' knowledge by ensuring competitiveness and long-run survival in emerging markets. This paper is among the first few attempts to look at pharmaceutical industry through the lens of trademarks, moving away from the traditional patent-focussed approach. It extends the understanding of OLI paradigm and highlights that MNEs need to possess Oa and Op advantages not only at the beginning of internationalisation process but rather evolving through the time to cope with imitation risks in the host country.",2020,Business & Economics,0
The creation and evolution of entrepreneurial public markets,Initial public offering; Venture capital; Innovation; Start-up; IPOS; RISE,"This paper explores the creation and evolution of new stock exchanges around the world geared toward entrepreneurial companies, known as second-tier exchanges. Using handcollected novel data, we show the proliferation of these exchanges in many countries, their significant volume of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), and lower listing requirements. Shareholder protection strongly predicted exchange success, even in countries with high levels of venture capital activity, patenting, and financial market development. Better shareholder protection allowed younger, less-profitable, but faster-growing, companies to raise more capital. These results highlight the importance of institutions in enabling the provision of entrepreneurial capital to young companies. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2020,Business & Economics,0
REMANUFACTURING WITH PATENTED TECHNIQUE ROYALTY UNDER ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION AND UNCERTAIN MARKETS,closed-loop supply chain; remanufacturing; fuzzy decision; royalty licensing; game theory; LOOP SUPPLY CHAIN; LICENSING CONTRACTS; NETWORK; DEMAND; DECISIONS; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; PROTECTION; PRODUCTS; DESIGN,"We study a dual-channel recycling closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) and investigate the royalty strategy involving cost-reducing technique for remanufacturing patented products. Facing information asymmetry and market uncertainty, we address the problem where the patent licensor (manufacturer) and licensee (remanufacturer) simultaneously compete in the sales market and the recycling market. We examine the optimal decisions of a decentralized CLSC (D-CLSC) with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate how the patented technology (cost-reducing technique) affects the channel players' behaviors and how to identify the optimal royalty fee. Based on the theoretical derivation and the numerical outcomes, we find that regardless of the CLSC structure (centralized or decentralized), the take-back prices and the total profits will rise with the increase of savings from the licensed technology. In the D-CLSC, (i) the expected profits of the manufacturer and the remanufacturer as well as the royalty fee will also rise with the savings from the licensed technology. (ii) In addition, the wholesale price, retail price, take-back prices, as well as the royalty fee will rise with the degree of information asymmetry. But the retailer's expected profit will decline. (iii) Finally, the expected profit of the manufacturer will rise with the demand uncertainty and the return uncertainty. For the remanufacturer, this trend is not obvious. Our research provides guidance to resolve conflicts and intellectual property disputes between the original manufacturer and the remanufacturer of the patented product.",2020,Business & Economics,0
"Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP) Regime in Canada: Amendments and Analysis of Granted, Pending, and Refused CSP Applications",Certificate of Supplementary Protection; Shingrix; Belsomra; CSP Register; Minister of Health Canada; ,"According to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), Canada introduced Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP) regime on 21 September 2017. Before CETA was executed, Canada was the only country of G7 (Group of 7) countries not to legislate Patent Term Extension (PTE). On 21 September 2020, CSP regime completed three years of existence. During these three years, few changes took effect in CSP regime. This article provides in-depth evaluation of CSP regime and such relevant changes. It also covers comparative analysis of number of CSP applications granted, pending, refused, and withdrawn. During these three years, about 95% CSP applications were filed for medicinal ingredient for human use and about 5% CSP applications were filed for medicinal ingredient for veterinary use. This article also provides analysis of type of patents referred in CSP applications, CSP applicant-wise analysis, and terms of granted CSPs. Comprehensive summary of Federal Court of Canada cases which involved challenges filed by CSP applicants over refusal of their CSP applications by the Minister of Health Canada is also provided.

Environmental policy uncertainty and corporate green innovation: evidence from China,Corporate green innovation; Environmental policy uncertainty; Turnover of environmental protection officials (EPOT); FIRM PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE; POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY; ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT EVIDENCE; CASH HOLDINGS; TURNOVER; IRREVERSIBILITY; PARTICIPATION; LEADERS; GROWTH,"Purpose Previous studies have mostly discussed the impact of environmental policy on enterprise innovation, but the discussion on how turbulence in environmental policy may affect firms' green innovation has been insufficient. This paper explores the effect of environmental policy uncertainty on corporate green innovation in the turnover of environmental protection officials (EPOT) context. Design/methodology/approach The authors manually collected the data on the EPOT of 280 Chinese prefecture-level cities, and used the Poisson regression model to conduct empirical analyses based on the panel data of 1472 Chinese listed manufacturing firms from 2008 to 2017. Findings The results show that environmental policy uncertainty leads firms to reduce their green patent applications only for green invention patent applications. Such an effect is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). In addition, when the new directors of the Ecology and Environmental Bureau take office through promotions or are no more than 55 years old, the negative effect is more obvious, but there is no significant difference regardless of whether new directors have worked in environmental protection departments. Originality/value First, this paper supplements the research on the antecedents of corporate green innovation from the perspective of environmental policy uncertainty and extends the applications of real options theory. Second, this paper expands the research on the government-business relationship from the EPOT perspective.",2022,Business & Economics,0

R&D investment and regional innovation performance - threshold effects based on intellectual property protection,Regional innovation performance; intellectual property protection intensity; R&D investment; human resource investment; Panel threshold model; DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY; LEVEL; STRATEGIES; PATENTS; RIGHTS; LAW,"Based on the panel data of 24 provinces and cities in China from 2009 to 2017, this paper uses panel threshold regression model with regional intellectual property protection intensity as the threshold variable to investigate the effect of R&D investment on regional innovation performance from two perspectives of human resource investment and R&D funding investment with different threshold effects. The results show that human resource investment and R&D investment have a significant contribution to regional innovation performance with a lag of three periods, and there is a significant double threshold effect. The optimal intellectual property protection intensity range of human resource input on regional innovation performance promotion is (0.8698, 0.8712). The optimal intellectual property protection intensity range for R&D investment on regional innovation performance is (0.8698, 0.8781), and R&D investment on regional innovation performance shows an increasing and then decreasing effect. This paper constructs a system of indicators to measure the intensity of intellectual property protection in China based on the dual-track parallelism of intellectual property protection management in China. It also measures the intensity of intellectual property protection in each region of China. A non-linear relationship between R&D investment, intellectual property protection and regional innovation is found.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Advancing corrosion protection in confined spaces: a solvent-free UV LED-curable coating for steel pipelines with enhanced barrier properties and harsh environment performance,Coatings; UV LED; Photopolymers; Corrosion protection; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; ANTICORROSIVE PROPERTIES; PHOSPHATE PIGMENTS; ORGANIC COATINGS; OIL; NSS,"This study investigates a novel solvent-free, UV LED-curable coating as a robust corrosion protection solution for the inner surface of steel pipelines. The properties of the UV-cured film were characterized in terms of reactivity, thermomechanical properties, and adhesion to metal substrates. The coating was applied to the inside steel pipelines and cured using a patented UV LED lamp designed to fit in confined spaces. Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization and an accelerated cyclic electrochemical technique were performed on the coated pipes to study the corrosion protection properties of the coating, both with and without the addition of inorganic fillers. The results were compared to a commercially available thermally cured coating. It was found that the UV-cured coating confers high barrier properties, effectively preventing liquid penetration even under elevated temperature conditions. Furthermore, the corrosion protection performance in harsh environments was comparable to and, in some cases, higher than standard epoxy linings.",2024,Chemistry; Materials Science,0
IMPACT OF IP PROTECTION ON EXPORT TRADE: EVIDENCE FROM THE ASIA-PACIFIC FTAs,Export trade; free trade agreement; intellectual property protection; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; PATENT RIGHTS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; AGREEMENTS; DETERMINANTS; LEVEL,"As intellectual property (IP) rules increasingly occur in the international trade policies, the change of IP rules in the free trade agreement (FTA) shows the trend of TRIPS-plus, leading the trade friction between countries into fierce IP competition. To clarify how the IP rules influence the export trade structure and to provide theoretical and practical advice for reconstructing free trade rules on international protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs), this study applies gap analysis and gravitation modeling on the 63 FTAs signed by significant economies in the Asia-Pacific region during the year 2000-2018. Finally, we find out that the sealing of the FTA IP rules would increase the proportion of IP-intensive and TM-intensive products in the total export trade. Incredibly pointed, enhancing the protection intensity is more significant for optimizing export trade structure in developed countries than in less developed countries.",2022,Business & Economics,0

Our study sets itself apart from previous measures by defining the strength of trademark protection as the level of applicant friendliness within a country's trademark system. We introduce the innovative trademark protection strength (TPS) index, which focuses on 78 countries spanning from 1990 to 2020. Drawing on established theoretical components of the patent system, we deconstruct the TPS index into four distinct dimensions: international mechanisms, legislation, enforcement and administration. Our findings reveal the growth and subsequent stabilisation of global trademark protection strength, with reduced disparities observed after 2005. Importantly, we identify variations in improvement rates among countries with different income levels, thereby highlighting the influence of economic factors. By providing a detailed methodology and transparent construction of the TPS index, we ensure its replicability and potential for future expansion. The index's objective data and extended coverage facilitate the examination of various configurations of IPR systems, policy designs and their impact on the global economy.",2024,Business & Economics; International Relations,0
"Technological radicalness, R&D internationalization, and the moderating effect of intellectual property protection",Technological radicalness; R&D internationalization; Intellectual property protection; Exploration vs. exploitation; Manufacturing companies; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; FIRM RESOURCES; INNOVATION; GLOBALIZATION; US; COUNTRIES; LOCATION; PATENT,"Drawing on insights from the resource-based view of the firm, this paper examines the link between the radicalness of the firm's technologies and the extent of its exploitation and exploration R&D activities abroad, with an additional focus on the level of the host country's intellectual property (IP) protection as a force moderating this link. It uses information about greenfield foreign direct investment by 185 U.S. publicly-traded manufacturing firms in the period 2003-2013 to demonstrate that technological radicalness is positively associated with the number of exploration and exploitation R&D projects. While the level of IP protection is shown to have a moderating effect, this is nuanced: firms with more radical technologies pursue more exploration R&D projects in countries with stronger IP protection; in turn, the number of exploitation R&D projects is driven by those undertaken in countries with weaker IP protection. The findings have both managerial and policy implications.",2022,Business & Economics,0
Government's awareness of Environmental protection and corporate green innovation: A natural experiment from the new environmental protection law in China,Environmental protection regulation; Green innovation; Information disclosure; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PORTER HYPOTHESIS; INVESTMENT EVIDENCE; RISK EVIDENCE; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITIVENESS; DISCLOSURE; INCENTIVES; EMISSIONS,"Based on the impact of the new environmental protection law promulgated by the Chinese government in 2015, we employ the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to investigate the impact of government environmental regulation on corporate green innovation. The evidence shows that government environmental regulation can significantly increase the number of green patents of heavily polluting industries. This result holds after a series of robustness tests. The analysis of the economic mechanism indicates that the new environmental protection law brings supervision pressure to heavily polluting firms, prompting them to improve the quality of information disclosure, thus improving green innovation. In addition, the regional economic development level, government subsidies, and public supervision can significantly affect the positive impact of the new environmental protection law. Meanwhile, the effect is more prominent in non-stateowned enterprises and in firms with small scale, low profitability, and weak internal governance.

Can central environmental protection inspection induce corporate green technology innovation?,Central environmental protection inspection; (CEPI); Green technology innovation (GTI); Innovative targeting; Difference-in-difference (DID); CAMPAIGN-STYLE ENFORCEMENT; POLICY IMPLEMENTATION; CHINA; REGULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT,"As a major institutional innovation of China's environmental governance system, whether the central environmental protection inspection can induce green technology innovation in heavily polluting corporates is crucial to deepening the reform of China's environmental governance system. Based on corporate green patent data from 2010 to 2019, the Difference-in-difference model is used to test the impact of the central environmental protection inspection on corporate green technology innovation after theoretically analyzes. The study finds that the central environmental protection inspection has significantly stimulated the green technology innovation of pollution-intensive industrial companies, by, in the main, encouraging corporates to develop innovative practices which increase the utilization efficiency of fossil energy and decrease end process pollutant emissions. However, green innovations in new energy sources that radically reduce pollution emissions are not significant. In addition, the green technology innovation induced by the central environmental protection inspection is not a superposition effect based on existing innovation activities, but the result of a crowding out of other technological innovations.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Global flows of knowledge: expectations toward transnational regulatory aspects of intellectual property rights in the 20th century chemical industry,Patents; Paris convention; E. Merck; regulation; ,"Legal and global historical research, especially about the German Empire, has identified an increasing tendency to internationalize the rule making of economic and technical contexts. Also the international protection of intellectual property rights made progress, so it seemed. The Paris Convention of 1883 did not harmonize the different national patent regimes, but intended to facilitate the transnational flow of inventions by a coordinated system of application and novelty. The aim of our paper is to show this limited approach of the Paris convention during the decades to come from two angles: The discussion and growing pressure from the part of the German Industry toward joining the convention, and - after 1903 - the concrete dealing with the convention's regulation, highlighted with a case study of the 1930s. It shows in detail the dealings between E. Merck, Darmstadt, and its US counterparts, when it came to secure priority rights in several European countries. The case studies show that an efficient transnational use of inventions could not really be achieved by the Paris convention, but rather by a self-regulative contract and patent management of the actors.",2020,History; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,0

Using the data of Chinese listed firms from 2007 to 2014, which provides an appropriate setting for our study, we find a positive relationship between R&D expenditure disclosures and the quantity of patents and patent applications, which is consistent with the institutional hypothesis. Moreover, we show that in the absence of sufficient institutional protection, market competition has a negative effect on R&D expenditure disclosures, which is consistent with the product market competition hypothesis. Further analyses show that this relation is affected by firm size, state ownership, loss-making, and analyst coverage. The results remain consistent after several robustness checks.

How does intellectual property protection in the host country affect outward foreign direct investment?,Outward foreign direct investment (OFDI); Intellectual property (IP) protection; Threshold regression; PATENT RIGHTS; INNOVATION,"This paper empirically analyses the impact of a host country's intellectual property (IP) protection on Chinese outward foreign direct investment (OFDI), employing panel data of 109 host countries' FDI stocks and IP protection levels. Based on the regression results, it is concluded that the host country's IP protection has a significant impact on Chinese OFDI. By including an interaction term into the regression, it can be seen that a host country's trade openness enhances the influence of intellectual property protection on OFDI. Using subsample regressions, it was found that the positive effect of the protection of IP rights by the host country on China's OFDI is stronger in the countries along China's 'Belt and Road' initiative. For a subsample of countries with a lower degree of IP protection than China, the positive effect of IP protection is weaker than in ones with a higher IP protection level. The results obtained through a threshold regression, show that host countries can be divided into three categories, based on gross domestic product per capita, namely low, medium and high development levels. The higher the level of economic development of the host country, the greater the impact of IP protection on China's OFDI. The host countries are also categorised into low-, medium- and high-level IP protection levels. As the level of a host country's IP protection improves, it promotes OFDI from China.",2021,Business & Economics,0

Based on the patent data of China's NEV industry from 2001 to 2022, combined with the logical framework of Patent Analysis-Network Evolution-Empirical research, this study deeply discusses the influence of enterprises' innovative network on TI. It is shown that there is an inverse U-relationship between the cooperation breadth of the enterprises, and that the appropriate cooperation breadth favors TI. At the same time, structural holes, knowledge diversity and technical value have a significant positive impact on TI.

Regulating Generic Ophthalmologic Drug Bioequivalence-Envisioning Accessibility for Patients,generic drugs; Food and Drug Administration; drug access; regulation; bioequivalence; IN-VITRO,"New, brand-name, ophthalmology drug products are developed, investigated, and submitted for marketing approval through premarket interactions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These drug applications for novel drugs are reviewed by FDA for safety and effectiveness before being allowed on the market. Many brand-name drugs are allowed a period of marketing exclusivity and/or have patent protections that can delay generic competition. When these exclusivity periods or patents expire or are challenged (in the case of patents), generic competitors may then market equivalent products, as allowed by U.S. law (eg, Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, often referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act). To be approved as a therapeutic equivalent, a generic product must demonstrate that it is both pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent to the brand-name drug product, which can involve innovative analytical methods and study designs. To facilitate generic drug assessment and approval, the FDA has negotiated the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) program that funds a rigorous generic drug development program that includes pre-Abbreviated New Drug Application (pre-ANDA) correspondence and meetings, targeted bioequivalence research, and publication of product-specific guidances (PSGs) to support generic drug research and development for manufacturers interested in developing generic drugs for the U.S. market.

It also explores the role of specific institutional factors - corruption and intellectual property rights (IPR) protection - on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach In the study, co-inventor data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) applications have been used to construct networks of technological knowledge collaboration at the country level over the years 2002-2015. Using eigenvector centrality as the dependent variable, the study uses fixed effect regression analyses on a panel of 171 countries, contributing to recent debates on knowledge networks and international cooperation. Findings Building on research in economic development, innovation and social network theory, this research finds that co-patenting with Chinese inventors is positively related to a country's centrality in global knowledge networks and that this relationship is negatively moderated by collaboration with the current most central knowledge network - namely that of the USA - suggesting a substitution effect. It also finds a partial substitution between institutional factors, IPRs protection and transparency, and collaboration with China on a country's knowledge centrality. Practical implications Regarding policymakers, the findings can be used to encourage international collaboration for increased access to new sources of knowledge that fosters innovation while keeping a close eye on local institutions, especially emerging economies that want to increase their international knowledge network centrality. Originality/value This study creates a unique panel data set and extends the social networks approach in international business literature, focusing on institutional characteristics related to participation in knowledge networks.",2023,Business & Economics,0
Tracing evolutionary trajectory of charging technologies in electric vehicles: patent citation network analysis,Electric vehicles; Charging technology; Patent analysis; Evolutionary trajectory; Main path analysis; MAIN PATH; BATTERY; ENERGY; OPPORTUNITIES; DIRECTIONS; INNOVATION; MODELS,"The development of electric vehicles (EVs) has been expanding rapidly in recent years to meet the demand of energy conservation and environmental protection. However, despite the promotion of EV, consumers are reluctant to buy EV because of issues such as charging anxiety and charging safety. For companies to break into the fierce competitiveness of the EV industry, it is imperative that those companies understand the evolutionary trajectory of EV technology to help them choose the right technology development path, and then focus on R&D objectives and improve R&D efficiency. This study proposes a patent-based framework to understand key characteristics, evolutionary trajectories and research development of EV charging technology. The results show that key technological developments in EV charging are concentrated on circuit arrangement, battery, safety device and charging station technologies. According to our co-opetition situation analysis, giant institutions do not cooperate closely with each other but compete mainly in the fields of electric traction, circuit arrangements, EV system control and charging stations. The findings not only contribute to monitoring the developmental trends and co-opetition situations in the EV charging field, but also provide managemental implications for policymakers in governments and managers in enterprises on the how to focus on research and development for EV based on the evolutionary trajectory from the patent analysis.",2023,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0
Innovative advances for neglected tropical disease (NTD): A global perspective from intellectual property,Health innovation; Intellectual property; Patent; Dengue fever; SDGs; Grand challenges; PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DENGUE; VACCINES; DRUGS,"This study examines innovative advances related to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which have severe health, social, and economic consequences that affect more than one billion people worldwide. It addresses the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals in tackling some of the Grand Challenges, such as dengue fever (DF), one of the primary and re-emerging diseases that have advanced worldwide in recent years. One of the challenges is the requirement that high investments in innovation can be rationalized by the potential returns sustained by the intellectual property protection system. This study answers the question: How have dengue- related innovations been approached globally from an intellectual property perspective? Seeking to shed light on innovative advances in NTD, this exploratory study adopted a (i) longitudinal approach, assessing the global impact of DF, and (ii) historical analysis from the intellectual property perspective, seeking the effectiveness of commercially viable solutions against the disease. An extensive search was conducted in international patent databases using Questel (R) (R) Orbit Intelligence software to address the proposed objective. This study selected 2307 invention patent families (FamPat) from 1993 to 2023, of which nearly half have expired or been revoked. China is the largest jurisdiction, with 415 FamPat filings. However, many regions with a high global burden of DF lack intellectual protection for DF-related innovations. Although the number of Fampat is relatively high for DF, and the interaction between universities, government, and private companies shows the potential development of an innovation ecosystem, few technological solutions are available. This study concludes that the capacity to absorb knowledge influences the effectiveness of making a technology available as a commercial product.",2024,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics,0

Our analysis of 529 alliances of East Asian firms during 1999-2015 suggests that as firms more skillfully overcome their partners' knowledge protection, they learn to better protect their own knowledge in subsequent alliances. However, such vicarious learning increases at a diminishing rate and is further weakened by the firm's relative absorptive capacity and the value chain scope of the previous alliance. Our study extends research on learning in alliances by demonstrating cross-alliance dynamics and by revealing conditions under which absorbing knowledge from previous partners helps a firm protect its own knowledge in subsequent alliances.",2024,Business & Economics; Psychology,0
The strategic need for the implementation of a technological platform for the microproduction of antidotes for the CBRN medical protection,medical protection; antidote; microproduction; technological platform; medical countermeasures; pharmaceutical technique; orphan drug production; ,"The volatile international context requires the strengthening of the national security measures, including in the field of CBRN and public health. The medical countermeasures for the defense are based ultimately on the prophylactic treatment (pre-exposure, intra-exposure and post-exposure) and on the curative treatment (of emergency, maintenance and recovery) of the contaminated and the sick. Depending on the rapid and correct etiological diagnosis, the appropriate treatment is immediately applied. Although in times of peace this scenario is almost non-existent, during war or terrorist attack it can be a mass pathology, like an explosive epidemic, that requires specific therapeutic means. Military medicine had and has the conceptual capacity to make antidotes for CBRN medical protection; some have been patented and/or produced as experimental models, but it has no manufacturing capacity anymore.",2020,General & Internal Medicine,0
Protecting expressions of Naga folklore through sui generis model,expressions of Folklore; Intellectual Property; Naga; sui generis; GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS,"Recently, the protection of expressions of folklore has been a concern in developing countries. In India, efforts have been made to protect expressions of folklore which usually involve Intellectual Property (IP) laws. However, the protection provided by IP laws may be inadequate for Naga communities. The paper attempts to analyse the limitations of IP laws of patents, copyrights, trademarks and GeographicalIndications (GI) for the protection of expression of Naga folklore. The finding shows that current IP laws in India do not fully protect the Naga folklore. This paper suggests that expressions of folklore need to look at alternative regimes. The paper further discusses the need for a sui generis legislation of an IP nature by presenting the example of sui generis legislation. As an overall outcome, it is concluded that a sui generis legislation of an IP nature would be able to protect the expression of Naga folklore.",2021,Government & Law,0
PERCEPTION OF ENTREPRENEURS IN THE CITY OF BABAHOYO REGAR-DING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW,entrepreneurs; protection of rights; Intellectual Property Law; crimes; legal assets; ,"The Intellectual Property Law in force in Ecuador is a legal tool that requires compliance and constant surveillance by entrepreneurs. The objective of this research is to evaluate the perception of entrepreneurs in the city of Babahoyo about Intellectual Property Law. Sixty-five entrepreneurs were considered as a sample, mostly with more than 3 years of experience. Respondents expressed the existence of shortcomings in the application of this Law, which cover aspects such as inadequate protection of copyrights and patents, insufficient training and awareness of citizens, and difficulties in its application and compliance. Reforms in legislation must be made to close existing loopholes and set up clearer and more complete frameworks that promote the protection of rights. It is necessary to invest in the training and education of entrepreneurs.",2023,Social Sciences - Other Topics,0
The Antibody Patent Paradox,; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; DOCTRINE; TOLERANCE; THERAPIES; HISTORY; POLICY; VIRUS,"Antibodies constitute a staggering $145 billion annual market-an amount projected to almost double by 2026. Consequently, patents covering antibodies are among the most valuable in the patent system. But antibody patents are being struck down left and right, victims of the Federal Circuit's recent shift to strengthen two doctrinal areas of patent law: enablement and the written description requirement. For each, the Federal Circuit has heightened requirements that patentees disclose or teach how to make and use the full scope  of their inventions.There are good reasons to be skeptical of the Federal Circuit's attack on genus claims in chemistry generally. But it seems to be a particular problem for antibodies. Applying the Federal Circuit's reinvigorated written description and enablement requirements to antibodies and their chemical structure fits poorly with the science underlying the molecules themselves. Immune -receptor production, a semi-random and galactically expansive process, produces antibodies that are startlingly different in both structure and function. There is no way to describe genus claims to antibodies that satisfy the court's current tests. The science simply doesn't allow it. At the same time, this change in the Federal Circuit's jurisprudence is a legitimate reaction to some of the problems with the long-standing (and long-permitted) practice of claiming antibodies in functional terms. Functional claiming can lead to overbroad patents that stifle future innovation, as it has done in the software industry. Perhaps the Federal Circuit is wary of a similar result in biotechnology. Fortunately, we think there is a middle ground. A new (or, really, quite old) form of patent -claim drafting would give inventors effective control over true substitutes without giving them the power to block real improvements: means-plus-function claims and infringement by the equivalents. Those doctrines limit patentees to claiming only the specific structural features of antibodies they both possessed and described, but also entitle them to assert their patents against antibodies with equivalent functions but different structural characteristics. If the economics of intellectual property center on balancing a need for protection beyond the literal invention with a desire to allow improvements, this seems a step in the right-or, at least in a doctrinally permissible and economically sensible-direction.Whether patentees go for such a solution remains to be seen. Recent empirical evidence on antibody claims has yet to document such a shift. Patent attorneys may need to get over their his-torical reluctance to writing their claims in such a fashion. Our solution won't give patentees eve-rything they want. But they just might find it gives them what they need.",2023,Government & Law,0
Low-Cost Maximum Power Point Tracking Strategy and Protection Circuit Applied to an Ayanz Wind Turbine with Screw Blades,wind energy; Ayanz Wind Turbine; Archimedes turbine; Archimedes Spiral wind blade; small wind turbine; maximum power point tracking; power conversion system; protection system; OF-THE-ART,"This paper provides three different research contributions applied to a Wind Turbine patented in 1606 by the inventor Jeronimo de Ayanz y Beaumont. The windmill under study is the Ayanz Wind Turbine with screw blades. The first contribution consists of an experimental characterization of the Ayanz Wind Turbine, incorporating the enclosure proposed at the patent and showing that the efficiency of the wind turbine is increased between 70% and 90% due to the enclosure being employed. As not many details about the shape of the screw blades are provided at the patent, in this article the nowadays well-studied and commercially available Archimedes Spiral Wind Turbine blade is utilized. It has been observed that by using an enclosure with a cylindrical shape, not only the efficiency of the wind turbine is increased, but the visual impact is reduced as seeing the blades rotating is avoided, which is a very important fact for many potential individual users of this wind turbine. In addition, it also enables the use of a protective mesh for birds, almost totally reducing the probability of bird deaths. The second contribution consists in a simple and low-cost Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) strategy for the wind turbine, which only uses an AC three-phase impedance to capture the maximum energy from the wind, enabling to eliminate the DC-DC converter and microprocessor employed typically for this purpose. Due to this, the cost, complexity, failure rate, and power losses of the electronic power circuit are reduced which is very welcomed for small-scale wind turbines. Finally, the last contribution is a protection electronic circuit that fulfills several objectives: to brake the wind turbine under high winds and to disconnect and protect it when over-currents occur and when the voltage range of the batteries connected to the wind turbine is outside their safety range.",2023,Energy & Fuels,0
Matching With Complementary Contracts,Complementarities; matching with contracts; stability; contract design; COMPETITIVE-EQUILIBRIUM; STABILITY; NETWORKS; DESIGN,"In this paper, we show that stable outcomes exist in matching environments with complementarities, such as social media platforms or markets for patent licenses. Our results apply to both nontransferable and transferable utility settings, and allow for multilateral agreements and those with externalities. In particular, we show that stable outcomes in these settings are characterized by the largest fixed point of a monotone operator, and so can be found using an algorithm; in the nontransferable utility case, this is aone-sideddeferred acceptance algorithm, rather than a Gale-Shapley algorithm. We also give a monotone comparative statics result as well as a comparative static on the effect of bundling contracts together. These illustrate the impact of design decisions, such as increased privacy protections on social media, or the use of antitrust law to disallow patent pools, on stable outcomes.",2020,Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,0
Governing the knowledge commons: Hybrid relational-contractual governance in china's mining industry,Knowledge commons; Knowledge sharing; Hybrid governance; Mining industry; China; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; FORMAL CONTRACTS; TACIT KNOWLEDGE; MODERATING ROLE; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; NETWORK; GUANXI; MECHANISMS; PATENTS,"How do industry participants govern knowledge commons and deal with knowledge production and sharing? Beyond privatized intellectual resources safeguarded by the intellectual property system (e.g., patent and copyrights), a knowledge commons is an alternative type of intellectual property regime that has become increasingly prevalent but remains understudied. Substantiated by fieldwork data in three mining sites in China's Jiangxi province, this article examines the ways in which contractual and relational governance mechanisms work together to facilitate collaboration and innovation and mitigate ambiguity and volatility. This study contributes to the existing literature on knowledge commons and innovation governance and enhances the empirical understanding of innovation in emerging economies where formal protection of intellectual property is insufficient.",2023,Development Studies; Business & Economics,0
Promoting Innovation: The Differential Impact of R&D Subsidies,Innovation; Patents; Research and development; R & D; Subsidies; Multinationals; Investment; Technology policy; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; PUBLIC SUBSIDIES; PROPENSITY SCORE; POLICY; ADDITIONALITY; PROTECTION; INTERNATIONALIZATION; STRATEGIES,"We investigate the effect of R & D subsidies on firms' innovation by ownership, industry, and firm size using German firm-level data. The impact of R & D subsidies is heterogeneous across industries for multinational corporations (MNCs) and domestic firms. This heterogeneity is robust using various estimators. Domestic firms have a larger response in R & D spending in low-tech and medium-term manufacturing, while the effect in high-tech manufacturing is larger for both domestic and foreign MNCs. In knowledge-intensive services and technological services, the response of domestic firms and in some cases foreign MNCs, is greater than that of domestic MNCs. In terms of patents, foreign MNC subsidiaries tend to have a larger count in high-tech manufacturing.",2023,Business & Economics,0
"The Costs of Drugs in Infectious Diseases: Branded, Generics, and Why We Should Care",drug costs; branded; generic; infectious diseases; HIV; hepatitis C; UNITED-STATES; PRICES,"While health care providers have largely turned a blind eye, the cost of health care in the US has been skyrocketing, in part as a result of rising drug prices. Patent protections and market exclusivity, while serving to incentivize targeted new drug development, have exacerbated inequitable outcomes and reduced access, sometimes fueling national epidemics. Branded drug manufacturers face few barriers to exorbitant pricing of drugs with exclusivity-as in the cases of Sovaldi, Zyvox, and Truvada. Furthermore, albendazole, pyrimethamine, and penicillin demonstrate that generic medications without patent exclusivity are not guaranteed to have durably low costs, especially where manufacturer competition is lacking. There is a way forward: through education and awareness, cost-conscious guideline development, government regulation, and market-level incentives, health care providers can collaborate to contain drug prices, curbing expenditures overall while expanding health care access to patients.",2020,Immunology; Infectious Diseases; Microbiology,0
DIGITALIZATION OF LAW IN THE MODERN WORLD,Legal system; Digitalization of law; Intellectual property; Electronic services; Scientific and technological progress; Patent service; ,"The study aims to investigate the concept, content, and nature of law digitalization processes taking place in the modern world. The paper examines an important direction of research that suggests that real provision of digital human rights calls for a state mechanism for their protection along with the search for an optimal legal compromise between the access of law enforcement services to information and the right of citizens to confidentiality. The study utilizes the method of induction, systemic scientific analysis, and comparative legal and historical methods. The leading method at the basis of solving the research problem is the comparative legal study of the digitalization of law. The paper categorizes and analyzes the processes of law digitalization and the closely related social processes of today, explores (based on the example of digitalization of legal relations on the protection of property rights to intellectual products) legal mechanisms of digitalization of patent services and specialized law firms. The authors conclude that the use of electronic distance voting will enable the science of constitutional law to discover new scientific approaches to making amendments to constitutions and statutes of constituent entities of the federation, as well as significant positive trends in practice that contribute to social justice, public administration efficiency, and anti-corruption.",2023,Government & Law,0
Comprehensive intellectual property ability and firm productivity: A quasi-natural experiment based on national intellectual property demonstration advantage firm policy in China,; PATENT PROTECTION; INNOVATION; RIGHTS; TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; SPILLOVERS; INVESTMENT; IMPACT; MATTER,"Intellectual property is crucial for the development of firms. At the micro level, firm comprehensive intellectual property ability involves abilities about intellectual property creation, utilization, protection, and management. In order to develop the comprehensive intellectual property ability of firms, the China National Intellectual Property Administration began to implement the national intellectual property demonstration advantage firm (NIPDAF) policy in 2013. Based on this exogenous policy shock, using data from listed companies from 2011 to 2020 as the research sample, the time-varying DID method is used to test the impact of the NIPDAF policy intended to cultivate comprehensive intellectual property ability on firm productivity. The results show that after policy implementation, the total factor productivity of NIPDAFs increased by about 3.3% compared to the control group. This finding is robust after a series of tests. Furthermore, the NIPDAF policy promotes firm productivity through stimulating technology innovation, improving investment efficiency, and enhancing competitive advantage. In addition, the NIPDAF policy has a more significant incentive effect on the total factor productivity of non-state-owned enterprises, firms in the eastern region, and firms in patent intensive industries.",2024,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0
Natural Product-Based Crop Protection Compounds?Origins and Future Prospects,agrochemical discovery; fungicide; herbicide; insecticide; natural products; natural product-based crop protection compounds; innovation in agrochemical discovery; LEAD GENERATION; DISCOVERY; DESIGN; TRENDS,"The continuing need to protect food and fiber production to address the demands of an expanding global population requires new pest management tools for crop protection. Natural products (NPs) have been and continue to be a key source of inspiration for new active ingredients (AIs) for crop protection, accounting for 17% of all crop protection AIs. However, potentially 50% of all crop protection compounds have or could have a NP origin if NP synthetic equivalents (NPSEs, synthetic compounds discovered by other approaches but for which a NP model also happens to exist) are also considered. The real and hypothetical NPs have their greatest impact as insight for new classes of crop protection compounds. Among the different product areas, NPs have their largest influence on the discovery of new insecticides, while herbicides have been the least affected by mining NPs for new AIs. While plants have historically been the largest (60% of the total) source of NPs of AIs for crop protection, in the last 30 years, bacterial NPs have become the largest source (42% of the total) of new classes (first in class) of NP-inspired crop protection AIs. Interest in NPs for crop protection continues, an aspect that is highlighted by the notable rise in the numbers of publications and patents on this topic, especially in the last 20 years. The present analysis further illustrates the continuing interest and value in NPs as sources of and inspiration for new classes of crop protection compounds.",2023,Agriculture; Chemistry; Food Science & Technology,0
